      "would impose arbitrary, harsh sentences in a way lacking foundation in any legislative judgment, \n",
      "FAMM has a strong interest in advocating for rigor-\n",
      "ous judicial scrutiny. \n",
      "INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY \n",
      "I. The rule of lenity has an important role to  \n",
      "play in the interpretation of mandatory minimum sentencing statutes and shou ld be given special force \n",
      "in cases that involve them.  Mandatory minimum \n",
      "sentencing statutes pose special threats to individual liberty and the separation of powers.  Experience \n",
      "teaches that such statut e s  l e a d  t o  s e v e r e  a n d  \n",
      "disproportionate sentences, reallocate power from \n",
      "legislators and judges to prosecutors, and often \n",
      "ultimately fail to achieve their ostensible goal of \n",
      "sentencing uniformity.  Experience also teaches that \n",
      "such statutes are poorly drafted and difficult to \n",
      "apply.  Because the costs of overreading harsh \n",
      "sentencing statutes are high , lenity counsels in favor \n",
      "of narrower reading. \n",
      " 3 \n",
      "A. The most obvious cost of error in overreading a  \n",
      "mandatory minimum sentencing statute is the lost liberty of individuals who receive a far longer prison term than the legislature actually intended.  Lenity \n",
      "embodies the courts' \"instinctive distaste[] against \n",
      "men languishing in prison unless the lawmaker has \n",
      "clearly said they should.\"  Henry J. Friendly, \"Mr. \n",
      "Justice Frankfurter and the Reading of Statutes,\" in \n",
      "Benchmarks  196, 209 (1967).  A mandatory 15-year \n",
      "sentence based on less-than-certain evidence of \n",
      "legislative intent is indeed distasteful.  Mandatory \n",
      "minimum statutes like the one here also reflect moral condemnation for a special subgroup of criminals – as \n",
      "shown by Congress's decision to pass an \"Armed \n",
      "Career Criminal Act\" (\"ACCA\") – that should follow \n",
      "only from a genuine legislative decision. \n",
      "Mandatory minimum sentencing statutes also \n",
      "impair courts' efforts to achieve the important goals \n",
      "of fairness and proportionate punishment.  Although Congress has the power (within constitutional \n",
      "bounds) to sacrifice fairness and proportionality to a \n",
      "perceived greater good, courts should not conclude \n",
      "that Congress has done so based on guesswork or \n",
      "speculation about the meaning of an unclear statute.  \n",
      "Often, mandatory minimum sentencing statutes fail \n",
      "to achieve the goal of sentencing uniformity because they place great power in the hands of prosecutors, \n",
      "thus inviting inconsistent and arbitrary application.  \n",
      "Applying the rule of lenity rigorously to such statutes \n",
      "lessens those costs to the system and ensures that \n",
      "they are imposed only when Congress has truly \n",
      "found them justified. \n",
      "By contrast, erring on the side of narrow \n",
      "constructions for mandatory minimum statutes is \n",
      "less risky.  Most importantly, judges always retain \n",
      "power to sentence up to the statutory maximum or to \n",
      " 4 \n",
      "run sentences for multiple offenses consecutively.  \n",
      "They do not need mandatory minimums to determine \n",
      "appropriate sentences based on the nature of an \n",
      "offense or the history and characteristics of an \n",
      "offender.  Moreover, the go vernment is well situated \n",
      "to press for new legislation if dissatisfied with the \n",
      "courts' interpretation.  There is no reason to doubt \n",
      "that prosecutors will call for stronger criminal penalties in response to any true threat to public \n",
      "safety or that legislators will fail to answer such calls. \n",
      "B. The risk of error is particularly acute when \n",
      "courts interpret mandatory minimum sentencing statutes.  As this Court knows all too well, Congress \n",
      "often writes such statutes in a confusing way.  The \n",
      "statutory provision here resulted from a rare \n",
      "confession of error by the Solicitor General that, in \n",
      "essence, Congress had left needed language out of a 15-year sentencing statute and so had inflicted a \n",
      "harsher and broader penalty than anyone involved  \n",
      "in the statute's creation (the Justice Department \n",
      "included) had anticipated.  This Court's recent cases \n",
      "have invalidated other parts of § 924 as unconsti-\n",
      "tutionally vague, and over the years the Court has \n",
      "remarked on similar problems with other mandatory minimum sentencing statutes.  When Congress \n",
      "enacts mandatory minimum sentencing statutes  \n",
      "with enormous effects on future defendants, but \n",
      "gives little consideration to statutory details, the rule \n",
      "of lenity provides a much-needed safeguard for \n",
      "individual liberty. \n",
      "II. The rule of lenity confirms that this Court \n",

Founded in 1991, FAMM currently has more than 75,000 members around the country. By mobilizing currently and formerly incarcerated people and their families who have been adversely affected by unjust sentences, FAMM illuminates the human face of sen-tencing as it advocates fo r state and federal sentenc- ing reform. FAMM advances its charitable purposes in part through education of the general public and through selected amicus filings in important cases. The interpretation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1) and the application of the principl es that govern all manda- tory minimum sentencing statutes are of paramount importance to FAMM. The court of appeals and the government have adopted an interpretation of § 924(e)(1) that treats prior offenses as having been \"committed on occasions different from one another\" if there is any separation in time – even just a few moments – between those offenses. That interpreta- tion has led in many cases, including this one, to mandatory 15-year prison terms for so-called career criminals where offenses making up the criminal 1 Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.6, counsel for amicus represent that they authored this brief in its entirety and that none of the parties or their counsel, nor any other person or entity other than amicus or its counsel, made a monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation or submission o f t h i s b r i e f .

This case offers the Court the opportunity to correct that harmful misinterpretation of the law and an excellent vehicle to reaffirm the important role of the rule of lenity in constraining a particularly extreme mandatory minimu m statute. As FAMM's members are keenly aware, in terpretation of language that triggers a mandatory minimum sentence often matters more to individual defendants' lives and lib- erty than interpretation of the elements for offenses sentenced through the exercise of judicial discretion. Where, as here, the government advances an expan- sive interpretation of a mandatory minimum that would impose arbitrary, harsh sentences in a way lacking foundation in any legislative judgment, FAMM has a strong interest in advocating for rigor- ous judicial scrutiny. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY I. The rule of lenity has an important role to play in the interpretation of mandatory minimum sentencing statutes and shou ld be given special force in cases that involve them. Mandatory minimum sentencing statutes pose special threats to individual liberty and the separation of powers. Experience teaches that such statut e s l e a d t o s e v e r e a n d disproportionate sentences, reallocate power from legislators and judges to prosecutors, and often ultimately fail to achieve their ostensible goal of sentencing uniformity. Experience also teaches that such statutes are poorly drafted and difficult to apply. Because the costs of overreading harsh sentencing statutes are high , lenity counsels in favor of narrower reading. 3 A. The most obvious cost of error in overreading a mandatory minimum sentencing statute is the lost liberty of individuals who receive a far longer prison term than the legislature actually intended. Lenity embodies the courts' \"instinctive distaste[] against men languishing in prison unless the lawmaker has clearly said they should.\" Henry J. Friendly, \"Mr. Justice Frankfurter and the Reading of Statutes,\" in Benchmarks 196, 209 (1967). A mandatory 15-year sentence based on less-than-certain evidence of legislative intent is indeed distasteful. Mandatory minimum statutes like the one here also reflect moral condemnation for a special subgroup of criminals – as shown by Congress's decision to pass an \"Armed Career Criminal Act\" (\"ACCA\") – that should follow only from a genuine legislative decision. Mandatory minimum sentencing statutes also impair courts' efforts to achieve the important goals of fairness and proportionate punishment. Although Congress has the power (within constitutional bounds) to sacrifice fairness and proportionality to a perceived greater good, courts should not conclude that Congress has done so based on guesswork or speculation about the meaning of an unclear statute. Often, mandatory minimum sentencing statutes fail to achieve the goal of sentencing uniformity because they place great power in the hands of prosecutors, thus inviting inconsistent and arbitrary application. Applying the rule of lenity rigorously to such statutes lessens those costs to the system and ensures that they are imposed only when Congress has truly found them justified. By contrast, erring on the side of narrow constructions for mandatory minimum statutes is less risky. Most importantly, judges always retain power to sentence up to the statutory maximum or to 4 run sentences for multiple offenses consecutively. They do not need mandatory minimums to determine appropriate sentences based on the nature of an offense or the history and characteristics of an offender. Moreover, the go vernment is well situated to press for new legislation if dissatisfied with the courts' interpretation. There is no reason to doubt that prosecutors will call for stronger criminal penalties in response to any true threat to public safety or that legislators will fail to answer such calls. B. The risk of error is particularly acute when courts interpret mandatory minimum sentencing statutes. As this Court knows all too well, Congress often writes such statutes in a confusing way. The statutory provision here resulted from a rare confession of error by the Solicitor General that, in essence, Congress had left needed language out of a 15-year sentencing statute and so had inflicted a harsher and broader penalty than anyone involved in the statute's creation (the Justice Department included) had anticipated. This Court's recent cases have invalidated other parts of § 924 as unconsti- tutionally vague, and over the years the Court has remarked on similar problems with other mandatory minimum sentencing statutes. When Congress enacts mandatory minimum sentencing statutes with enormous effects on future defendants, but gives little consideration to statutory details, the rule of lenity provides a much-needed safeguard for individual liberty. II. The rule of lenity confirms that this Court should reverse the judgment of the court of appeals. Petitioner Wooden correctly argues that 18 U.S.C. § 924(e) should be read in his favor even without the rule of lenity. If any doubt remains, lenity should dispose of it. That conclusion is further supported 5 by examining judicial experience with cases under § 924(e)(1). The standard endorsed by the court of appeals – under which even a moment's separation between two prior offenses qualifies them as occurring on different occasions – has led to inconsistent results, arbitrary distinctions, and repeated judicial observations about confusion and uncertainty in the statutory scheme. A. One recurring type of situation involves burglaries of related or adjacent structures or dwellings. Examples include the mini-warehouses at issue here; a group of adjacent storage units at the same street address in United States v. Carr , 592 F.3d 636 (4th Cir. 2010); and three businesses in a single strip mall in United States v. Hudspeth , 42 F.3d 1015 (7th Cir. 1994) (en banc), abrogated on other grounds by Shepard v. United States , 544 U.S. 13 (2005). Whether assessed against the constitu-tional right to fair warnin g or the legislature's sole responsibility under the Constitution to define crimes, the statute does no t clearly classify several break-ins in the course of a day or an hour as prior offenses on \"occasions different from one another.\" Accordingly, the statute should not be construed to mandate 15 years in prison by treating such offenses as separate violent felonies. B. Another situation that repeatedly arises under § 924(e) is an offense co mmitted while the defendant evades or resists arrest for another offense. Examples include pushing a police officer after committing a robbery, United States v. Schieman , 894 F.2d 909 (7th Cir. 1990); fleeing a police officer after a traffic stop that interrupted a domestic assault, United States v. Davidson , 527 F.3d 703 (8th Cir. 2008), vacated in part on other grounds , 551 F.3d 807 (8th Cir. 2008) (per curiam); and 6 committing two assaults in the course of a single high-speed chase, Levering v. United States , 890 F.3d 738 (8th Cir. 2018). The decisions applying § 924(e) to these situations acknowledge confusion and judicial disagreement, with some courts ruling that any separation of time between the onset of two offenses supports a finding that they occurred on different occasions. No such rule can be clearly derived from the present statute using ordinary rules of statutory construction. The courts of appeals should instead have followed the tradition of lenity to answer the difficult questions posed by this statute. ARGUMENT I. THE RULE OF LENITY SHOULD BE APPLIED RIGOROUSLY TO MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCING STATUTES \"[T]he rule of lenity[] teach[es] that ambiguities about the breadth of a cri minal statute should be resolved in the defendant's favor.\" United States v. Davis , 139 S. Ct. 2319, 2333 ( 2019). That rule has famously been described as \"'perhaps not much less old than' the task of statut ory 'construction itself.'\" Id. (quoting United States v. Wiltberger , 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 76, 95 (1820) (Marshall, C.J.)). At its core the rule of le nity is an understanding that \"a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed,\" and that, \"[t]o make the warning fair, so far as possible the line sh ould be clear.\" McBoyle v. United States , 283 U.S. 25, 27 (1931) (Holmes, J.). In addition, judicial adherence to the rule of lenity also \"places the weight of inertia upon the party\" – that is, the executive branch – \"that can best induce Congress to speak more clearly and keeps courts 7 from making criminal law in Congress's stead.\" United States v. Santos , 553 U.S. 507, 514 (2008) (plurality); see Bell v. United States , 349 U.S. 81, 83 (1955) (Frankfurter, J.) (\" When Congress leaves to the Judiciary the task of imputing to Congress an undeclared will, the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of lenity.\"). In several cases involving mandatory minimum sentencing provisions, the Court has recognized and applied the \"presupposition . . . [that] doubts in the enforcement of a penal code\" should be \"resolve[d] . . . against the imposition of a harsher punishment.\" Bell, 349 U.S. at 83. Examples include Davis , which invoked lenity to reject a broader saving construction of a different provision of the same mandatory mini- mum statute at issue here, see 139 S. Ct. at 2333; Burrage v. United States , 571 U.S. 204 (2014), which described a 15-year mandat ory minimum statute as \"a criminal statute subject to the rule of lenity,\" and lenity as a reason the Court \"[e]specially\" could not depart from the \"ordinary, accepted meaning\" of \"the [statutory] text,\" id. at 216; and United States v. Granderson , 511 U.S. 39 (1994), which \"appl[ied] the rule of lenity\" to \"resolve [an] ambiguity\" in a \"mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment\" after revocation of probation, id. at 56-57. Those decisions cohere with others explaining that the rule of lenity assists \"not only to resolve issues about the substantive scope of criminal statutes, but to answer questions about the severity of sentencing.\" United States v. R.L.C. , 503 U.S. 291, 306 (1992) (plurality) (citing Bifulco v. United States , 447 U.S. 381, 387 (1980) (collecting cases)). Indeed, especially good reasons warrant applying the rule of lenity rigorously to statutes that, like the ACCA, create aggravated offenses with mandatory 8 minimum sentences. A broad construction bars judges from tailoring the sentence to the offense and the offender, leading to particularly harsh conse- quences that only Congress can correct. A narrower construction, by contrast, does not prevent judges from imposing longer sentences where necessary. \"These interpretive asymmetries give the rule of lenity special force in the context of mandatory minimum provisions.\" Dean v. United States , 556 U.S. 568, 585 (2009) (Breyer, J., dissenting). Further, experience shows that mandatory mini- mum statutes frequently present difficult problems of statutory construction, creating a heightened risk that courts will read them to impose sentences that Congress never intended. Wh ere, as here, an unclear statute presents a palpable risk of error, courts properly refuse to \"condemn a man to a minimum of 15 years in prison on the basis of . . . speculation,\" Begay v. United States , 553 U.S. 137, 154 (2008) (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment), about what Congress meant to say. A. The Rule of Lenity Helps Avoid the Particularly High Costs of Reading Mandatory Minimums Too Broadly 1. The costs of erroneously construing mandatory minimum sentencing provisions too broadly are especially high, and the costs of construing them too narrowly are especially low. The greatest cost of reading a mandatory minimu m too broadly is that individual defendants lose their liberty. Mandatory minimum provisions are, by design, severe. They often tie an additional prison sentence of years or decades (here, a decade and a half) to a single factual determination. Such provisions therefore speak to the core concern that has motivated courts to apply the rule of lenity for centuries: the \"instinctive 9 distaste[] against men lang uishing in prison unless the lawmaker has clearly sa id they should.\" Henry J. Friendly, \"Mr. Justice Frankfurter and the Reading of Statutes,\" in Benchmarks 196, 209 (1967), quoted in United States v. Bass , 404 U.S. 336, 348 (1971). Because of that concern, this Court \"will not interpret a federal criminal statute so as to increase the penalty that it places on an individual when such an interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what Congress intended.\" Ladner v. United States , 358 U.S. 169, 178 (1958). Further, mandatory minimum provisions often are said to reflect (at least in theory) the moral judgment of the community that particular conduct deserves harsher punishment. In our system of government, that judgment is reserved to the legislature. The rule of lenity ensures that criminal sentences actually reflect legislative judgment, rather than guesswork by the courts abo ut what the legislature meant. See Granderson , 511 U.S. at 69 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment) (\"'[B]ecause criminal punishment usually represents the moral condemna- tion of the community, legislatures and not courts should define criminal activity,' and set the punish- ments therefor.\") (quoting Bass , 404 U.S. at 348) (citation omitted); R.L.C. , 503 U.S. at 309 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and co ncurring in the judgment) (describing one of \"the rule of lenity's . . . purpose[s]\" as \"assuring that the society, through its represen- tatives, has genuinely called for the punishment to be meted out\"); Wiltberger , 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) at 95 (explaining that \"[t]he rule that penal laws are to be construed strictly\" is founded not merely on \"tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals\" but also on the \"plain principle that the power of 10 punishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial department\"). Any criminal statute presents these concerns, but mandatory minimum provisions make them particularly weighty. Unlike other criminal laws, mandatory minimums are exceptions to the principle that courts should \"impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary,\" to accomplish the goals of criminal punishme nt after considering \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1). A mandatory minimum is a congressional directive to subordinate justice in individual cases to a perceived need for greater deterrence or incapacitation generally. Congress may choose to make that tradeoff (within constitu- tional bounds), but the courts should ensure that Congress has actually made that choice before imposing needlessly harsh punishments. Cf. Busic v. United States , 446 U.S. 398, 408-09 (1980) (interpreting a sentencing enhancement; rejecting the \"assumption that . . . Congress' sole objective was to increase the penalties . . . to the maximum extent possible\"). 2. The adverse consequences of erroneously expanding mandatory sentencing beyond the limits of congressional intent affect more than just individual defendants. Such errors strike at the foundations of the sentencing system by under- mining \"sentencing proportionality – a key element of sentencing fairness.\" Harris v. United States , 536 U.S. 545, 570-71 (2002) (Breye r, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment), overruled by Alleyne v. United States , 570 U.S. 99 (2013). As the Sentencing Commission – quoted with approval by this Court – has explained: \"'The \"cliffs\" that result 11 from mandatory minimums compromise proportion- ality, a fundamental prem ise for just punishment, and a primary goal of the Sentencing Reform Act.'\" Neal v. United States , 516 U.S. 284, 291-92 (1996) (quoting United States Sentencing Comm'n, Special Report to the Congress: Mandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System iii (Aug. 1991)). Further, the rule of leni ty historically has been justified in part based on the \"principle of legality\": conduct can be criminalized , and penalties author- ized, only by legislative action, so \"that the amount of discretion entrusted to those who enforce the law does not exceed tolerable lim its.\" Herbert L. Packer, The Limits of the Criminal Sanction 93 (1968). As the Court put it in Marinello v. United States , 138 S. Ct. 1101 (2018), \"prosecutorial discretion\" to enforce a statute with \"wide-rangin g scope . . . places great power in the hands of the prosecutor,\" creating risks of \"nonuniform execution\" and \"arbitary prosecution.\" Id. at 1108-09. That concern is one reason for the Court's \"'traditional[] exercise[]'\" of \"'restraint in assessing the reach of a federal criminal statute.'\" Id. at 1109 (quoting United States v. Aguilar , 515 U.S. 593, 600 (1995)). And it is a special problem with mandatory minimums that effectively transfer sentencing discretion from the trial judge, \"the one actor in the system most ex perienced with exercising discretion,\" to \"an assistant prosecutor not trained in the exercise of discretion.\" An Address by Anthony M. Kennedy, Associate Justic e, Supreme Court of the United States, Speech at the American Bar Associ- ation Annual Meeting (Aug. 9, 2003), available at https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/speeches/sp_08-09-03.html. 12 Inconsistently exercised discretion means that, in practice, mandatory minimums fail to yield even uniformity in sentencing – the benefit they are supposed to obtain at the cost of individual justice and proportionality. Over decades, the Sentencing Commission has repeatedly reported \"inconsisten[cy]\" and \"wide geographic variations\" in the use of mandatory minimum sentences. E.g., United States Sentencing Comm'n, Application and Impact of 21 U.S.C. § 851: Enhanced Penalties for Federal Drug Trafficking Offenders 6 (July 2018) (finding \"significant variation in the extent to which . . . enhanced penalties were sought against eligible offenders\"); see also United States v. Angelos , 345 F. Supp. 2d 1227, 1252 (D. Utah 2004) (discussing \"the potential for tremendous sentencing disparity if federal prosecutors across th e country do not uniformly charge . . . violations\" of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)), aff'd , 433 F.3d 738 (10th Cir. 2006). 2 2 See also United States Sentencing Comm'n, Mandatory Minimum Penalties for Sex Offenses in the Federal Criminal Justice System 56 (Jan. 2019) (finding that, \"[i]n fiscal year 2016, the mandatory minimum penalty for receipt [of child por-nography] [wa]s inconsistently applied,\" leading to \"substantial\" differences in sentences where \"the conduct involved in the offenses was not meaningfully distinguishable\"); United States Sentencing Comm'n, Report to Congress: Mandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System 345 (Oct. 2011) (\"2011 Report\") (finding \"inconsistencies in application of certain mandatory minimum penalties, as shown by . . . data analyses and confirmed by interviews of prosecutors and defense attorneys\"); United States Sentencing Comm'n, Fifteen Years of Guidelines Sentencing: An Assessment of How Well the Federal Criminal Justice System is Achieving the Goals of Sentencing Reform 89 (Nov. 2004) (\"Research over the past fifteen years has consistently found that mandatory penalty statutes are used inconsistently in cases in which they appear to apply.\"). 13 Indeed, over the last two decades, different Attorneys General have instructed federal prose- cutors differently on how to use mandatory minimum statutes, switching between more- and less-aggressive approaches.3 In adopting such policies, the executive branch takes into its own hands the tradeoff between sentencing uniformity, on the one hand, and individual justice and proportionality, on the other. Whatever the wisdom of the competing approaches, that practice emphasizes how mandatory minimum statutes transfer power over individual liberty from lawmakers and judges to pr osecutors. In our adver- sarial system, moreover, pr osecutors can and do use that power strategically in ways that undermine structural protections for individual liberties, such as by using the threat of a mandatory minimum to obtain a guilty plea. See United States v. Kupa , 976 F. Supp. 2d 417, 420 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (condemning the practice of \"coerc[ing] guilty pleas, and sometimes . . . coerc[ing] cooperation as well, [by] routinely threaten[ing] ultra-harsh, enhanced mandatory sentences that no one – not even the prosecutors themselves – thinks are appropriate\") (footnote omitted), aff 'd, 616 F. App'x 33 (2d Cir. 2015) . 3 See Angelos , 345 F. Supp. 2d at 1253 & n.120 (discussing a 2003 memorandum intended \"to reduce charging disparities stemming from § 924(c)\"); United States Sentencing Comm'n, An Overview of Mandatory Minim um Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System 24-25 (July 2017) (comparing the 2013 \"Smart on Crime\" initiative, which outlined circumstances in which prosecutors should \"'decline to charge'\" mandatory minimum sentences, to \"revised guidance\" in 2017 directing prosecutors generally to \"'charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense,'\" with seriousness measured by the greatest sentence, \" 'including mandatory minimum sentences' \"). 14 Nor does the expansion of prosecutorial power through mandatory minimum statutes stop at the charging stage. Even after conviction, the prosecutor holds an important key to lessening the effect of a mandatory minimum sentence. A district court is freed from restrictions on its sentencing discretion \"[u]pon motion of the Government . . . so as to reflect a defendant's substantial assistance in the investi-gation or prosecution of another person,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e), or it can similarly reduce the sentence later, again with the government's approval, under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b)(4). 4 Suc h discretionary motions have large effects on sentences, often reducing them by many years.5 Research has found \"enorm ous differences in how prosecutors exercise that di scretion, with substantial variation by district.\"6 Again, within broad constitu- tional bounds, Congress has the power to create such a system. But the Court need not and should not broaden more than Congress's language requires 4 In certain cases involving no n-violent drug offenders, a district judge may invoke 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f), often called a judicial \"safety valve,\" but the sa fety valve is \"narrow\" and still requires prosecutorial approval in substance if not in form. Rachel E. Barkow, Categorical Mistakes: The Flawed Frame- work of the Armed Career Criminal Act and Mandatory Mini- mum Sentencing , 133 Harv. L. Rev. 200, 218 (2019). 5 See United States Sentencing Comm'n, Mandatory Minimum Penalties for Firearms Offenses in the Federal Criminal Justice System 42 (Mar. 2018) (\"In fiscal year 2016, the average sentence for offenders who remained subject to the mandatory minimum penalty [under § 924(e)] at sentencing was 200 months, signifi-cantly longer than the average sentence for offenders relieved of this mandatory minimum penalty (112 months).\"). 6 Barkow, Categorical Mistakes , 133 Harv. L. Rev. at 224 & n.183, 236 & n.281 (discussing the 2011 and 1991 Reports). 15 statutes that give prosecutors powers over individual lives traditionally reserved for independent judges. 3. By contrast, the costs of erroneously construing a mandatory minimum provision too narrowly are relatively low, both for individual cases and for the criminal justice system as a whole. In cases that fall outside the scope of a mandatory minimum, but that nevertheless feature aggravating circumstances similar to those that moved Congress to impose the minimum, a sentencing judge still has discretion (guided by § 3553(a) and the sentencing guidelines) to impose a more severe sentence. As Justice Breyer explained in Dean , \"an interpretive error on the side of leniency[] still permits the sentencing judge to impose a sentence similar to, perhaps close to, the statutor y sentence even if that sentence . . . is not legislatively required .\" 556 U.S. at 584 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Moreover, \"an error that excludes (erroneously) a set of instances Congress me ant to include . . . could lead the Sentencing Commission to focus on those cases . . . [and] make avail able to Congress a body of evidence and analysis that w ill help it reconsider the statute.\" Id. at 585. Those who bring actions under the criminal laws (the executive branch) have far greater access to thos e who create them (the legislative branch) than do those who defend against such actions (potential criminal defendants). In light of this practical reality, the rule of lenity \"places the weight of inertia upon the party that can best induce Congress to speak more clearly.\" Santos , 553 U.S. at 514 (plurality). 16 B. The Risk of Reading Mandatory Minimums Too Broadly Is Also Particularly High The risk of mistaking congressional intent is also unusually high in the case of mandatory minimum provisions. Those provisions often do not originate from a careful and considered drafting process. The history of the \"occasions different from one another\" language of § 924(e) (1) is a good example: as petitioner shows in detail, that language stemmed from then-Solicitor-General Fried's confession of error to this Court in Petty v. United States , 481 U.S. 1034 (1987) (No. 86-6263). In that case, the United States candidly admitted that the different-occasions language, present in \"other enhanced penalty provisions,\" was omitted from the predecessor to § 924(e)(1), even though the legislative history showed \"that both Congress and those supporting the legislation, including the Department of Justice, did not intend that the penalty provision would apply more broadly than in the case of the other federal enhanced penalty statutes.\" Pet. Br. App. 25a-26a; see id. at 26a-31a. Had the United States not taken the unusual step of confessing error in Petty , the courts might well have concluded – as the Eighth Circuit already had –that Congress had intentionally left the different-occasions language out of th e statute. After all, as the Solicitor General's brief pointed out, courts construing statutes often draw a \"negative implica- tion\" from the omission of language in one statute that is present in anot her, similar statute. Id. at 26a (citing Rodriguez v. United States , 480 U.S. 522, 525 (1987) (per curiam)). An d courts reaching that conclusion would have imposed minimum 15-year sentences, not based on a \"genuine[] call[] for th[at] 17 punishment\" by \"society['s] . . . representatives,\" R.L.C. , 503 U.S. at 309 (Scalia, J., concurrring in part and concurring in the judgment), but based on a slip of the legislative pen. There are other examples. Indeed, § 924(e) presents one: its \"residual clause\" defined a \"violent felony\" to include any felony that \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.\" 18 U.S.C. § 924( e)(2)(B)(ii). This Court struck that clause down as unconstitutionally vague in Johnson v. United States , 576 U.S. 591 (2015), relying in part on \"[n]ine years' experience trying to derive meaning from the residual clause\" as evidence that the courts had \"embarked upon a failed enterprise.\" Id. at 601-02. And the Court reached the same conclusion in Davis as to § 924(e)'s cousin § 924(c), striking down a similarly vague clause that triggered mandatory minimum sentences of 5, 7, 10, and 25 years. See 139 S. Ct. at 2325, 2336. In United States v. O'Brien , 560 U.S. 218 (2010), the Court described as \" unclear\" yet another provi- sion of § 924(c) that i mposed a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence for possessing a machinegun while committing certain crimes. Id. at 227, 229. Facing that lack of clarity, the Court applied a five-factor test to determine whether machinegun possession was intended to be an offense element or as a sentencing factor. See id. at 227-32. In Granderson , the Court diplomatically observed that 18 U.S.C. § 3565(a), imposi ng a mandatory minimum sentence for certain revocations of parole, did not \"appear[] . . . to have received Congress' careful attention.\" 511 U.S. at 42. Justice Scalia less diplomatically called § 3565(a) \"wretchedly drafted.\" Id. at 60 (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment). 18 The Court's repeated struggles with opaque text and structure in mandatory minimum provisions are the kind of \"experience\" that is \"the life of the law.\" Johnson , 576 U.S. at 601. That experience teaches that mandatory minimum sentencing statutes, including the one at issue here, commonly use \"sweeping and imprecise language\" that \"set[s] up a host of vexing constitutional and statutory interpretation questions for the courts.\" Barkow, Categorical Mistakes , 133 Harv. L. Rev. at 202. The rule of lenity, \"as a so rt of 'junior version of the vagueness doctrine,'\" United States v. Lanier , 520 U.S. 259, 266 (1997) (quoting Packer, Criminal Sanction at 95), is a useful doctrinal approach to answering those questions. If the Court finds the statute now before it ambiguous, lenity can help – and an emphasis on lenity in the context of mandatory minimum statutes can help guide the lower courts to solve futu re, similar problems that will inevitably arrive. 7 7 Some have stated that \"a court must find not just ambiguity but 'grievous ambiguity' before resorting to the rule of lenity.\" Shular v. United States , 140 S. Ct. 779, 788 & n.2 (2020) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (collecting examples). Other recent decisions, drawing on a long line of authority, have applied principles of lenity without the adjective \"grievous.\" See, e.g., Davis , 139 S. Ct. at 2333 (invoking lenity where \"a criminal statute . . . d[id] not clearly proscribe\" conduct and stating that \"ambiguities about the breadth of a criminal statute should be resolved in the defendant's favor\"). The notion that lenity applies only in cases of \"grievous ambiguity\" appeared in this Court's cases relatively recently. See Chapman v. United States , 500 U.S. 453, 463 (1991) (quoting Huddleston v. United States , 415 U.S. 814, 831 (1974), which had stated that the Court \"perceive[d] no grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in\" a statute before it, id., but did not suggest that \"grievous ambigu- ity\" was a threshold requirement for any reliance on lenity). The rule of lenity itself goes back for centuries. In any event, 19 II. JUDICIAL EXPERIEN CE WITH 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1) SUPPORTS APPLYING THE RULE OF LENITY Petitioner's brief ably sets forth why the Sixth Circuit's analysis finds no support in the ACCA's text, history, or purpose. FAMM agrees that this Court can and should reverse the judgment of the Sixth Circuit without resort to the rule of lenity or the principles that underlie it. If the Court finds the question close, however, it may help to consider judicial experience applying the same standard that the Sixth Circuit applied here. Examining that experience counsels in favor of lenity. That experience shows that the approach of the court of appeals – asking wh ether \"it [is] possible to discern the point at which the first offense is completed and the subsequent point at which the second offense begins,\" JA22 – does not satisfy this Court's teaching that \"so far as possible the line should be clear.\" McBoyle , 283 U.S. at 27. Nor does that test align, in any way \"the common world will understand,\" id., with Congress's effo rt to classify as an armed career criminal someone who has \"three previous convictions . . . for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another, \" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). Instead, the temporal-sequencing test is at best \"no more than a guess as to what Congress intended,\" Ladner , 358 U.S. at 178 – a guess that produces arbitrary and unpredictable results. where all the tools of statutory construction fail to resolve genu- ine ambiguity as to whether Congress has demanded a manda- tory prison term, that ambiguity can fairly be called \"grievous.\" 20 A. Entries of Separate Structures on a Single Day or Night Are Not Clearly Multiple Different \"Occasions\" 1. The decision under review is a useful starting point. According to the Sixth Circuit, all 10 of Wooden's 1997 convictions for burglary, which took place on a single night, were \"separate ACCA predicate offenses\" that occurred on \"'occasions different from one another.'\" JA21 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1)). To support that conclusion, the court of appeals reasoned that, \"[w]hatever the contours of a 'mini' wareho use, Wooden could not be in two (let alone ten) of them at once\"; that he \"could have ceased his criminal conduct\" after entering the first warehouse without en tering nine more; and that, although \"one could characterize th[e] cluster of warehouses as being adjoined 'at the same business location,'\" they were \"different locations\" because their owners had \"distinct se ts of property rights.\" JA23-24. Wooden argues persuasively (at 30) that the \"textual foundations\" for the court of appeals' \"test . . . are essentially nonexistent.\" Even if the statute does not wholly foreclose th at test, it certainly gives no fair warning that unlawfully entering 10 small warehouses within the same building on a single evening triggers a harsh 15-year penalty for later owning a gun, while spending the same amount of time in a single warehouse would not. The court of appeals' analysis thus \"mak[es] criminal law in Congress's stead.\" Santos , 553 U.S. at 514 (plurality). At best it is judicial doctrine built up to cover the lack of clarity in the statute, rather than anything that can claim to be an application of the statute itself. Those who agree with Justice Scalia that \"it is not consistent with the rule of lenity 21 to construe a textually ambiguous penal statute against a criminal defendant on the basis of legis- lative history,\" R.L.C. , 503 U.S. at 307 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment), can stop there, because the statute is at least textually ambiguous. Those who look to legislative history as an interpretive guide should reach the same ultimate conclusion. As Wooden persuasively shows (at 21- 25), that history ranges fr om an Assistant Attorney General's 1984 testimony that the statute was meant to catch \"people who have demonstrated . . . that locking them up and letting them go doesn't do any good,\" Pet. Br. Add. 29a; to the Solicitor General's 1987 concession in Petty that the statute was \"intended\" to cover \"multiple criminal episodes,\" id. at 26a; to then-Senator Biden's 1988 statement that the statute was meant to \"express[] [a] concept of what is meant by a 'career criminal,'\" 134 Cong. Rec. S17,370 (daily ed. Nov. 10, 1988). None of this suggests an intent – let alone a clear one – to consider multiple offenses on a single night to be a career in crime because it took a few seconds to move from one mini-warehouse to another within a cluster of such warehouses. 2. The Fourth Circuit's decision in United States v. Carr , 592 F.3d 636 (4th Cir. 2010), illustrates the same point. That case involved Daryl Carr, who possessed a firearm after previously pleading guilty to 13 state-law charges of \"felony breaking or entering.\" Id. at 638. Those 13 offenses all took place on a single day in 2006 during which Carr broke into each of 13 \"different storage unit[s]\" at the same street addres s (\"N.C. 32 South\"). Id. The court of appeals conceded that the offenses were \"substantively the same and arguably had the same 22 criminal objective,\" but it nevertheless found them to be \"separate and distinct criminal episodes.\" Id. at 645. It reasoned that the storage units were \"different locations\"; that mo st, though not all, of the offenses had \"different victims\"; and that Carr \"had the opportunity . . . to cease and desist his criminal behavior\" between one storage unit and the next, adding in a footnote that \"Carr simply could not have broken into or entered the 13 separate storage units simultaneously.\" Id. at 645 & n.8 (citation omitted). 8 In that analysis, the Fourth Circuit asserted that the statutory \"'definition may be clear'\" but conceded that \"'the factual permutations surrounding the ACCA tend to create havoc'\"; that \"'courts have applied a multiplicity of factors'\" in cases involving § 924(e); and that the \"analysis\" has a \"fluid nature.\" Id. at 640 (quoting United States v. Letterlough , 63 F.3d 332, 335 (4th Cir. 1995)). That sort of assessment ought to be a warning sign in construing a criminal statute: it calls to mind this Court's observation in Johnson that \"pervasive disagreement about the nature of the inquiry one is supposed to conduct and the kinds of factors one is supposed to consider\" is a sign of unacceptable vagueness. 576 U.S. at 601. The present case, to be sure, is not a vagueness challenge. But the rule of lenity – and the \"constitutional principles underlying th[at] rule,\" Davis , 139 S. Ct. at 2333 n. 8 – counsels against adopting a line of authority whose own proponents report fluidity at best and havoc at worst. 8 In another footnote, the Fourth Circuit noted that Carr had other \"state convictions\" on different dates, at least one of which involved \"assault by pointing a gun,\" Carr , 592 F.3d at 639 n.3, but did not analyze whether they constituted ACCA predicates or rely on them for its holding. 23 3. The Seventh Circuit's decision in United States v. Hudspeth , 42 F.3d 1015 (7th Cir. 1994) (en banc), involved Thomas Hudspeth, who on one day in 1983 broke into three businesses – \"a doughnut shop, a dry cleaners, and an insurance company.\" Id. at 1018-19. The businesses were in the same \"strip mall,\" id., where the burglars made \"a hole through [a] shared wall\" and \"forced open the door\" connecting two of the businesses, id. at 1022. The whole affair took \"approximately thirty-five minutes.\" Id. at 1018-19. A majority of the Seventh Circuit held that, because Hudspeth's three offenses were \"committed sequen- tially, against different victims, at different times, and at different locations,\" they were \"clearly crimes 'committed on occasions different from one another.'\" Id. at 1021. One concurrence reasoned that Hudspeth was \"appropriately sentenced because . . . the record shows three separate crimes against separate victims and not a single crime or criminal occasion (whatever that is).\" Id. at 1025 (Bauer, J., concurring). One partial dissent noted that past decisions had \"grappl[ed] with the ambi guity of the ACCA\" and noted \"the malleability of the relevant terms,\" including the different-occasions language. Id. at 1025-26 (Flaum, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Another, joined by five of the 11 judges who heard the case, agreed that the \"cold print of the statute books\" did not answ er the question before the court and argued for interpreting § 924(e) as a \"congressional mandate . . . to identify the true recidivist.\" Id. at 1034, 1037 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). None of the opinions in Hudspeth suggested applying the rule of lenity. Yet at least six members 24 of the en banc court – counting Judge Bauer, whose concurrence expressed marked frustration with the statutory language – appear to have found no answer to the question before them in § 924(e).9 As judicial experience goes, that is further evidence that \"Congress le[ft] to the Judiciary the task of imputing to Congress an undeclared will,\" Bell, 349 U.S. at 83, concerning prior offenses that occur over a short period of time in several adjacent structures. B. Evading or Resisting Arrest Does Not Clearly Involve Multiple Different \"Occa- sions\" Another situation that repeatedly arises under § 924(e) is an offense af ter which the defendant evades or resists arrest. A rule that focuses on sequence in time treats evasion or resistance as a different \"occasion,\" because it is possible to imagine a point at which the defendant stops the first offense and starts running. But an ordinary person trying to figure out the meaning of the statute from its words would not likely reach that conclusion. Nor do the tools of statutory construction suggest that Congress meant to treat such an offender as a career criminal deserving 15 years in prison. 1. In United States v. Schieman , 894 F.2d 909 (7th Cir. 1990), David Schi eman received a 15-year sentence based in part on prior convictions of burglary and aggravated batte ry of a police officer. Id. at 910. As a partial dissent explained: 9 Hudspeth relied on police reports to determine the circum- stances of prior offenses; Shepard v. United States , 544 U.S. 13, 16 (2005), later barred courts from considering police reports in applying § 924(e). The Seventh Circuit has since cited Hudspeth as \"abrogated\" at least in part by Shepard . See, e.g., United States v. Elliott , 703 F.3d 378, 384 n.3 (7th Cir. 2012). 25 Schieman committed a robbery, walked three blocks away to make a telephone call [at a phone booth] to arrange transportation away from the scene, and, in an attempt to evade apprehension, pushed a police officer at the phone booth. The pushing incident occurred approximately five minutes after the robbery. Id. at 913 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The majority reasoned that, \"[o]nce the original crime is complete, there is no principled way to distinguish\" between a battery \"within ten minutes of the burglary\" and one \"a day after the burglary.\" Id. at 913 (majority). One giving the words \"different\" and \"occasion\" their ordinary meaning might well think that both Schieman's burglary and his attempt to escape five minutes later occurred on the same occasion. One thinking of the statute as an attempt to identify career criminals would reach the same result. And the Schieman court's reasoning only emphasizes how traditional principles of lenity support that conclusion. The court took a case it thought clear (escape a day later) and used it to resolve a case it thought unclear (escape five minutes later) by arguing the lack of a \"principled . . . distin[ction]\" between the two. But the felt need to invoke the day-after hypothetical itself shows that the statute does not speak clearly to the five -minute case. The court's role was therefore to limit the 15-year sanction to the case where it was unambiguously intended. 2. In United States v. Davidson , 527 F.3d 703 (8th Cir. 2008), vacated in part on other grounds , 551 F.3d 807 (8th Cir. 2008) (per curiam), Mark Davidson was sentenced under § 924(e) based on prior convic- tions that included an attempted domestic assault 26 and fleeing from a police officer who interrupted that attempt with a traffic stop. Id. at 707. The Seventh Circuit conceded that the \"pause between the two offenses was brief\" and that the crimes were committed in \"rapid succession,\" but reasoned that a \"moment of relative calm\" had occurred when the officer stopped Davidson, creating \"a point of demarcation between episodes\" that justified treating Davidson's prior convictions as separate. Id. at 710. The Davidson court candidly acknowledged that the circuits had \"struggled with th[e] problem\" of applying § 924(e) to resist ance or evasion offenses, \"reaching arguably inconsistent results,\" id. at 709, discussing Schieman and other examples. Considered as an exercise in the common-law method, the \"point of demarcation\" analysis that Davidson derived might not be exceptional. But it has been settled since United States v. Hudson , 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 32 (1812), that \"federal crimes . . . are solely creatures of statute,\" Liparota v. United States , 471 U.S. 419, 424 (1985), a principle that lenity helps protect, see id. at 427-28. And the distinction that Davidson and cases like it draw – if it can even be squared with the statute at all – is clearly a rule made by the courts rather than one set down by statute. 3. In Levering v. United States , 890 F.3d 738 (8th Cir. 2018), Merwyn Leveri ng was sentenced under § 924(e) based on prior convictions that included at least two assaults in the cour se of a high-speed flight from police officers in a stolen automobile. Id. at 739. Levering argued that the assaults were not committed on different occasions because the flight was a \"'continuous course of conduct.'\" Id. at 741. The Eighth Circuit acknowledged that \"the phrase 'continuous course of conduct' appears in our cases on 27 this subject,\" but rejected it as \"unhelpful to the analysis.\" Id. at 742. Instead, the court relied on the fact that the assaults were committed \"at different times in different counties against different victims.\" Id. The Eighth Circuit acknowledged that several unpublished decisions from the Sixth Circuit pointed to a different result, but \"respectfully differ[ed]\" with them. Id. Like the Fourth Circuit's acknowledgment of \"havoc\" in Carr , the vigorous disagreement among members of the Seventh Circuit in Hudspeth , and the Eighth Circuit's own earlier acknowledgment of \"arguabl[e] inconsisten[cy]\" in Davidson , the reasoning of Levering points to the type of pervasive uncertainty about statutory application that suggests courts have gone beyond the guidance that an unclear statute can offer. It is especially telling that – as the Eighth Circuit's criticism of the Sixth Circuit shows – courts theoretically applying the sa me sequential test reach different results as to similarly situated defendants. 4. None of this is to deny that fleeing from arrest and assaulting someone while doing so is not serious misconduct that state and sometimes federal law properly criminalize. The police officer in Schieman could have been hurt, as could the bystanders to the high-speed chases in Davidson and Levering . Nor is there any doubt that after their prior convictions the various defendants were prohibited from possessing guns, see 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), and could be punished for breaking that law. The function of § 924(e), however – as its text, structure, and history all show – is to carve out a special set of repeat offenders, labeled as \"armed career criminals,\" for special condemnation and harsh mandatory punishment. It is impossible to read the cases struggling with these 28 issues and conclude that the legislature has \"clearly said\" that those defendants should \"languish[] in prison,\" Bass , 404 U.S. at 348 (cit ation omitted), for at least 15 years. \n"

      "INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY \n",
      "I. The rule of lenity has an important role to  \n",
      "play in the interpretation of mandatory minimum sentencing statutes and shou ld be given special force \n",
      "in cases that involve them.  Mandatory minimum \n",
      "sentencing statutes pose special threats to individual liberty and the separation of powers.  Experience \n",
      "teaches that such statut e s  l e a d  t o  s e v e r e  a n d  \n",
      "disproportionate sentences, reallocate power from \n",
      "legislators and judges to prosecutors, and often \n",
      "ultimately fail to achieve their ostensible goal of \n",
      "sentencing uniformity.  Experience also teaches that \n",
      "such statutes are poorly drafted and difficult to \n",
      "apply.  Because the costs of overreading harsh \n",
      "sentencing statutes are high , lenity counsels in favor \n",
      "of narrower reading. \n",
      " 3 \n",
      "A. The most obvious cost of error in overreading a  \n",
      "mandatory minimum sentencing statute is the lost liberty of individuals who receive a far longer prison term than the legislature actually intended.  Lenity \n",
      "embodies the courts' \"instinctive distaste[] against \n",
      "men languishing in prison unless the lawmaker has \n",
      "clearly said they should.\"  Henry J. Friendly, \"Mr. \n",
      "Justice Frankfurter and the Reading of Statutes,\" in \n",
      "Benchmarks  196, 209 (1967).  A mandatory 15-year \n",
      "sentence based on less-than-certain evidence of \n",
      "legislative intent is indeed distasteful.  Mandatory \n",
      "minimum statutes like the one here also reflect moral condemnation for a special subgroup of criminals – as \n",
      "shown by Congress's decision to pass an \"Armed \n",
      "Career Criminal Act\" (\"ACCA\") – that should follow \n",
      "only from a genuine legislative decision. \n",
      "Mandatory minimum sentencing statutes also \n",
      "impair courts' efforts to achieve the important goals \n",
      "of fairness and proportionate punishment.  Although Congress has the power (within constitutional \n",
      "bounds) to sacrifice fairness and proportionality to a \n",
      "perceived greater good, courts should not conclude \n",
      "that Congress has done so based on guesswork or \n",
      "speculation about the meaning of an unclear statute.  \n",
      "Often, mandatory minimum sentencing statutes fail \n",
      "to achieve the goal of sentencing uniformity because they place great power in the hands of prosecutors, \n",
      "thus inviting inconsistent and arbitrary application.  \n",
      "Applying the rule of lenity rigorously to such statutes \n",
      "lessens those costs to the system and ensures that \n",
      "they are imposed only when Congress has truly \n",
      "found them justified. \n",
      "By contrast, erring on the side of narrow \n",
      "constructions for mandatory minimum statutes is \n",
      "less risky.  Most importantly, judges always retain \n",
      "power to sentence up to the statutory maximum or to \n",
      " 4 \n",
      "run sentences for multiple offenses consecutively.  \n",
      "They do not need mandatory minimums to determine \n",
      "appropriate sentences based on the nature of an \n",
      "offense or the history and characteristics of an \n",
      "offender.  Moreover, the go vernment is well situated \n",
      "to press for new legislation if dissatisfied with the \n",
      "courts' interpretation.  There is no reason to doubt \n",
      "that prosecutors will call for stronger criminal penalties in response to any true threat to public \n",
      "safety or that legislators will fail to answer such calls. \n",
      "B. The risk of error is particularly acute when \n",
      "courts interpret mandatory minimum sentencing statutes.  As this Court knows all too well, Congress \n",
      "often writes such statutes in a confusing way.  The \n",
      "statutory provision here resulted from a rare \n",
      "confession of error by the Solicitor General that, in \n",
      "essence, Congress had left needed language out of a 15-year sentencing statute and so had inflicted a \n",
      "harsher and broader penalty than anyone involved  \n",
      "in the statute's creation (the Justice Department \n",
      "included) had anticipated.  This Court's recent cases \n",
      "have invalidated other parts of § 924 as unconsti-\n",
      "tutionally vague, and over the years the Court has \n",
      "remarked on similar problems with other mandatory minimum sentencing statutes.  When Congress \n",
      "enacts mandatory minimum sentencing statutes  \n",
      "with enormous effects on future defendants, but \n",
      "gives little consideration to statutory details, the rule \n",
      "of lenity provides a much-needed safeguard for \n",
      "individual liberty. \n",
      "II. The rule of lenity confirms that this Court \n",
      "should reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.  \n",
      "Petitioner Wooden correctly argues that 18 U.S.C. \n",
      "§ 924(e) should be read in his favor even without the \n",
      "rule of lenity.  If any doubt remains, lenity should \n",
      "dispose of it.  That conclusion is further supported  \n",
      " 5 \n",
      "by examining judicial experience with cases under \n",
      "§ 924(e)(1).  The standard endorsed by the court of \n",
      "appeals – under which even a moment's separation \n",
      "between two prior offenses qualifies them as \n",
      "occurring on different occasions – has led to \n",
      "inconsistent results, arbitrary distinctions, and \n",
      "repeated judicial observations about confusion and \n",
      "uncertainty in the statutory scheme. \n",
      "A. One recurring type of situation involves \n",
      "burglaries of related or adjacent structures or dwellings.  Examples include the mini-warehouses at \n",
      "issue here; a group of adjacent storage units at the same street address in United <MASK>States v. Carr , 592 \n",

      "Accordingly, the statute should not be construed to \n",
      "mandate 15 years in prison by treating such offenses \n",
      "as separate violent felonies.  \n",
      "B. Another situation that repeatedly arises under \n",
      "§ 924(e) is an offense co mmitted while the defendant \n",
      "evades or resists arrest for another offense.  \n",
      "Examples include pushing a police officer after \n",

Hudspeth pled guilty to one count of unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g)(1).  The sentencing judge found that Hudspeth qualified for an enhancement of his sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\\\"ACCA\\\"), 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e)(1), based on his criminal record.  The ACCA mandates a sentence of not less than fifteen years for a defendant with three prior convictions for violent felonies who is subsequently convicted for the unlawful possession of a firearm.  The court imposed a fifteen year sentence, which Hudspeth appeals on two grounds:  first, that he was improperly sentenced as an \\\"armed career criminal\\\" under the ACCA, and second, that the district court's recalculation of his sentence violated the Double Jeopardy Clause.  We affirm.\\n\\nI.\\nBACKGROUND\\n\\n2\\nOn August 1, 1991, Hudspeth pled guilty to one count of unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.1  Prior to Hudspeth's plea, the government advised him that it intended to seek the minimum fifteen year sentence enhancement2 authorized by the ACCA, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e)(1), which states:\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\\"In the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title and has three previous convictions by any court ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another, such person shall be fined not more than $25,000 and imprisoned not less than fifteen years.\\\"\\n\\n\\n4\\nHudspeth had three prior burglary convictions for crimes committed in Sangamon County, Illinois.  The district court reviewed the police reports from Hudspeth's three prior burglaries,3 which described the following facts concerning Hudspeth's 1983 state burglary convictions.4  On March 27, 1983, at about 7:15 p.m., Hudspeth and two others were observed at the Laketown Shopping Center, a strip mall in Springfield, Illinois.  Hudspeth was carrying a large canvas bag, which was later discovered to contain a sledge hammer, pry bars, chisels, a screwdriver, a pipe wrench, two police scanners, and a CB radio.  In approximately thirty-five minutes, the three men broke into and ransacked a doughnut shop, a dry cleaners, and an insurance company.  The burglars were apprehended during their attempt to enter a fourth business.5\\n\\n\\n5\\nThe district court found that Hudspeth's three 1983 convictions for burglary were three \\\"separate crimes against separate victims in separate locations.\\\"   Thus the court concluded that Hudspeth's burglaries were crimes \\\"committed on occasions different from one another\\\" and thus qualified Hudspeth for the minimum fifteen year sentence enhancement set by Sec. 924(e)(1).\\n\\nII.\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\n6\\nA. Sentence Enhancement Under the Armed Career Criminal Act\\n\\n\\n7\\n1. Crimes \\\"Committed on Occasions Different From One Another\\\"\\n\\n\\n8\\nUnder the ACCA, a thrice convicted felon, who is subsequently convicted for the unlawful possession of a firearm, is subject to a mandatory sentence of not less than fifteen years provided that the three prior convictions resulted from acts \\\"committed on occasions different from one another....\\\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e)(1).6  This Circuit and other Circuits have had numerous opportunities to interpret the phrase \\\"committed on occasions different from one another \\\" in situations like the present case where several crimes were committed in rapid succession.  This Circuit has joined nine other Circuits, including the First, Second, Third, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth and Eleventh, in holding that a defendant is subject to the sentence enhancement if each of the prior convictions arose out of a \\\"separate and distinct criminal episode.\\\"  United States v. Schieman, 894 F.2d 909, 911 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 856, 111 S.Ct. 155, 112 L.Ed.2d 121 (1990) (emphasis added);  see United States v. Pedigo, 879 F.2d 1315 (6th Cir.1989);  United States v. Towne, 870 F.2d 880 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1101, 109 S.Ct. 2456, 104 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1989);  United States v. Schoolcraft, 879 F.2d 64, 74 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 995, 110 S.Ct. 546, 107 L.Ed.2d 543 (1989);  United States v. Herbert, 860 F.2d 620 (5th Cir.1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1070, 109 S.Ct. 2074, 104 L.Ed.2d 639 (1989);  United States v. Gillies, 851 F.2d 492 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 857, 109 S.Ct. 147, 102 L.Ed.2d 119 (1988);  United States v. Rush, 840 F.2d 580 (8th Cir.1988);  United States v. Antonie, 953 F.2d 496, 498-99 (9th Cir.1991), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 138, 121 L.Ed.2d 91 (1992);  United States v. Green, 967 F.2d 459, 462 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 435, 121 L.Ed.2d 355 (1992);  United States v. Greene, 810 F.2d 999 (11th Cir.1986).\\n\\n\\n9\\nThis Circuit, when considering whether multiple convictions arose out of \\\"separate and distinct criminal episodes,\\\" has consistently looked to the nature of the crimes, the identities of the victims, and the locations.  In Schieman, the defendant committed a burglary;  three blocks away and ten minutes later he attacked and injured a police officer.  Schieman, 894 F.2d at 913.   Judge Bauer, writing for the court, ruled that Schieman's actions constituted two separate \\\"occasions\\\" under the ACCA because he \\\" 'committed separate crimes against separate victims in separate locations.' \\\"  Id. (quoting Towne, 870 F.2d at 881 (emphasis added).\\n\\n\\n10\\nWe followed the same reasoning in United States v. Godinez, 998 F.2d 471 (7th Cir.1993).  In Godinez, the defendant kidnapped a woman at 8:45 p.m. in order that he might use her car in a robbery.  He took the victim to his apartment where an accomplice kept watch over her.  The defendant then drove the victim's car to a convenience store where he committed the robbery at 10:00 p.m.  He was arrested on the way back to his apartment.  Id. at 472.   In Godinez we held that even though the defendant admitted that he kidnapped the woman in order to use her car in the robbery, the kidnapping and robbery were two separate criminal aggressions against separate victims.  Id. at 472-73.\\n\\n\\n11\\nIn Godinez, we distinguished Schieman from Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970), in which the defendant (Ashe) committed multiple offenses on a single occasion (in the same location and at the same time) by \\\"robb[ing] six players at a poker game, committing at least six [simultaneous] crimes with the same [command of] 'stick 'em up'.\\\"  Godinez, 998 F.2d at 472.   Judge Easterbrook explained that\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\\"[o]rdering six poker players at the same game to empty their pockets is one criminal episode.  But one crime hard on the heels of another can be a 'separate and distinct criminal episode', as Schieman itself shows.  Schieman committed a burglary.  Three blocks away he attacked and wounded a police officer.  This was a distinct transaction, we held, because the burglary was over....  Schieman could have committed either crime without the other;  a person willing to commit both is more dangerous than a person who confines himself to one.  That the two crimes were close in time did not matter, we concluded.\\\"\\n\\n\\n13\\nId. (emphasis added) (citations omitted).  Godinez concluded that \\\"the question is not whether one crime overlaps another but whether the crimes reflect distinct aggressions.\\\"  Id. at 473 (emphasis added);  see also United States v. Washington, 898 F.2d 439, 441-42 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 842, 111 S.Ct. 122, 112 L.Ed.2d 91 (1990) (successive robberies of the same store clerk at the same convenience store by the same defendant within two hours held to be separate criminal episodes);  Antonie, 953 F.2d at 499 (two armed robberies committed on the same evening approximately forty minutes apart held to be two separate predicate offenses).\\n\\n\\n14\\nIn United States v. Tisdale, 921 F.2d 1095 (10th Cir.1990), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 596, 116 L.Ed.2d 619 (1991), a case factually indistinguishable from the one before us, the Tenth Circuit held that a burglar who broke into three stores in a mall had committed the crimes on three separate \\\"occasions\\\" under the ACCA:\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\\"After the defendant 'successfully completed' burglarizing one business, he was free to leave.  The fact that he chose, instead, to burglarize another business is evidence of his intent to engage in a separate criminal episode.  Moreover, unlike [United States v. Petty, 798 F.2d 1157 (8th Cir.1986), vacated, 481 U.S. 1034, [107 S.Ct. 1968, 95 L.Ed.2d 810], on remand, 828 F.2d 2 (8th Cir.1987) ], the defendant's burglaries did not occur at the same location.  The record shows that although defendant entered one shopping mall he had to physically break [into] and enter three separate structures.   The fact each incident occurred inside one enclosed structure does not alter our conclusion that the crimes were committed at different locations.  Thus we find that the trial court properly enhanced the defendant's penalty under Sec. 924(e)(1).\\\"\\n\\n\\n16\\nId. at 1099 (emphasis added).\\n\\n\\n17\\nCases interpreting the ACCA clearly uphold the minimum fifteen-year sentence enhancement for criminals who commit separate crimes against different individuals while on a spree, within a short period of time, provided that the perpetrator had the opportunity to cease and desist from his criminal actions at any time.  For instance, in United States v. Brady, 988 F.2d 664, 668-669 (6th Cir.)  (en banc), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 166, 126 L.Ed.2d 126 (1993), the Sixth Circuit held that two armed robberies committed against different victims at different locations within the span of forty-five minutes were separate criminal episodes.  The court in Brady defined a criminal episode as \\\"an incident that is part of a series, but forms a separate unit within the whole.  Although related to the entire course of events, an episode is a punctuated occurrence with a limited duration.\\\"  Id. (citing United States v. Hughes, 924 F.2d 1354, 1361 (6th Cir.1991)).  Under the ACCA, the relevant inquiry as to the timing of multiple crimes is simple:  were the crimes simultaneous or were they sequential?\\n\\n\\n18\\nHudspeth's criminal history clearly makes him a proper subject for the sentence enhancement provision of the ACCA.7  Hudspeth committed three distinct burglaries against three separate victims (the owners of three distinct business enterprises), in three separate locations8 over the course of more than thirty minutes9--a greater period of time than the two crimes committed in Schieman (ten minutes).  Hudspeth's three burglaries were sequential (committed in succession), and not simultaneous;  it is physically impossible for one person to commit three burglaries simultaneously at three different locations.  Because Hudspeth's crimes were committed sequentially, against different victims, at different times, and at different locations, they were clearly crimes \\\"committed on occasions different from one another\\\" as required under the ACCA.  See Tisdale, 921 F.2d at 1099.\\n\\n\\n19\\nThe ACCA is directed at criminals who make a career out of criminal activity.  A defendant who has the opportunity to cease and desist or withdraw from his criminal activity at any time, but who chooses to commit additional crimes, deserves harsher punishment than the criminal who commits multiple crimes simultaneously.  An individual who commits simultaneous crimes (one single criminal action directed against a number of individuals), as did the defendant in Petty, has no opportunity to turn back and abandon his criminal conduct--the crime is completed with the single utterance of \\\"stick 'em up.\\\"   See Godinez, 998 F.2d at 472.   The same is true of an individual who violates multiple criminal statutes by a single act.10  In contrast, a defendant who commits sequential crimes has the opportunity at each and every turn to withdraw from his criminal activity.\\n\\n\\n20\\nHudspeth, a professional burglar, came to the Laketown Shopping Center armed for each and every eventuality that might arise.  Hudspeth was observed carrying a bag, later found to contain a sledge hammer, pry bars, chisels, a screwdriver, a pipe wrench, two police scanners, and a CB radio.  Obviously he had cased the premises in advance for he knew precisely which tools were necessary to break into the individual business locations.  The record implies that the burglars first unlawfully pried open the rear door of the dry cleaners.11  At that point, the three men could have terminated their criminal endeavor, but they chose instead to commit a second burglary.  The burglars then used a sledge hammer to bust a hole through the shared wall between the dry cleaners and the doughnut shop.  Once again, Hudspeth could have aborted the criminal activity, but he decided instead to commit a third burglary.  One of the burglars then forced open the door connecting the doughnut shop and the insurance company.  Following this entry, the burglars attempted to enter a fourth business, but they were apprehended during their attempt.\\n\\n\\n21\\nEntry into each successive business reflected a clear and deliberate choice to commit a \\\"distinct aggression,\\\" Godinez, 998 F.2d at 473.   At any given point in time during his crime spree, Hudspeth was free to cease and desist from further criminal activity.  He instead chose to continue.  Because of his three decisions to enter each successive business, it is evident that he intended \\\"to engage in a separate criminal episode.\\\"  Tisdale, 921 F.2d at 1099;  see also Godinez 998 F.2d at 472 (\\\"one crime hard on the heels of another can be a 'separate and distinct criminal episode', as Schieman itself shows\\\").12\\n\\n\\n22\\n2. The Legislative History of Sec. 924(e)(1)\\n\\n\\n23\\nAs an initial matter, we must state our disagreement with the use of legislative history to interpret unambiguous statutory language.  As a court of appeal, we may turn to the legislative history to interpret a statute only when the statute is ambiguous.  United States v. Shriver, 989 F.2d 898, 901 (7th Cir.1992);  see also United States v. Real Estate Known as 916 Douglas Ave., 903 F.2d 490, 492 (7th Cir.1990) (\\\"we will look beyond the express language of a statute only where that statutory language is ambiguous or where a literal interpretation would lead to an absurd result or thwart the purpose of the overall statutory scheme\\\").13  We are of the opinion that the phrase \\\"committed on occasions different from one another\\\" is unambiguous.14  Other members of this court, however, believe the phrase \\\"committed on occasions different from one another\\\" is ambiguous, and have looked to the legislative history for guidance.  For this reason, a brief review of the legislative history becomes necessary.\\n\\n\\n24\\nIn 1988, Senator Joseph Biden proposed amending Sec. 924(e)(1) of the ACCA to require sentence enhancement for multiple convictions only when those convictions resulted from crimes \\\"committed on occasions different from one another.\\\"   This new language was proposed after the Eighth Circuit's original decision in Petty, in which the court held that the ACCA's fifteen year minimum sentence could be imposed on a defendant with six prior convictions for armed robbery stemming from an incident in which the defendant robbed six different people in a restaurant simultaneously.  United States v. Petty, 798 F.2d 1157, 1159-60 (8th Cir.1986), vacated, 481 U.S. 1034, 107 S.Ct. 1968, 95 L.Ed.2d 810 (1987).15  Although neither the statute nor the legislative history defines exactly what Congress meant by \\\"occasions different from one another,\\\"16 the legislative history does more than merely imply that Congress intended only to preclude the classification of simultaneous offenses as separate offenses for the purposes of sentence enhancement under the ACCA.  Senator Biden explained that the amendment would serve to punish career offenders, even for multiple offenses committed on the same night, so long as the crimes are not simultaneous in nature.\\n\\n\\n25\\n\\\"Under the amendment, the three previous convictions would have to be for offenses 'committed [on] occasions different from one another.'   Thus a single multicount conviction could still qualify where the counts related to crimes committed on different occasions, but a robbery of multiple victims simultaneously (as in Petty) would count as only one conviction.\\\"\\n\\n\\n26\\n134 Cong.Rec. S17,370 (daily ed. Nov. 10, 1988) (remarks of Sen.  Biden).  Congress added the phrase \\\"committed on occasions different from one another\\\" to address situations similar to Petty, where a defendant's single action results in the commission of multiple, simultaneous crimes.  The amendment would also preclude the separate consideration of multiple convictions arising from a single criminal act that violates several different criminal statutes.  See supra n. 10.  Neither of these situations is presented by the case before us.\\n\\n\\n27\\nAs made clear earlier in this opinion, Hudspeth did not commit three simultaneous crimes against multiple victims as the defendant did in Petty where, at one time, with one single command, and in one location, Petty robbed six people.  Nor did Hudspeth violate several statutes with a single criminal act.  Hudspeth committed three separate crimes, at three separate times, against three separate victims, in three separate locations.  Under the plain language of Sec. 924(e)(1) as well as the legislative history, Hudspeth committed his crimes on three \\\"occasions different from one another.\\\"\\n\\nB. Double Jeopardy\\n\\n28\\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause states that no person shall \\\"be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\\\"   U.S. Const., amend.  V.  The Clause prohibits multiple punishments for the same offense.  Ohio v. Johnson, 467 U.S. 493, 498, 104 S.Ct. 2536, 2540, 81 L.Ed.2d 425 (1984).  A sentencing court may not sentence a defendant to multiple punishments for the same offense in excess of the total punishment authorized by the legislature.  United States v. Halper, 490 U.S. 435, 450-51, 109 S.Ct. 1892, 1902-03, 104 L.Ed.2d 487 (1989).\\n\\n\\n29\\nIn an unpublished order, a panel of this court initially vacated Hudspeth's original sentence and remanded the case to the district court, with instructions to \\\"hold a hearing, enter findings of fact, and determine whether a proper basis exists for applying the Sec. 924(e) enhancement.\\\"  United States v. Hudspeth, No. 91-3786, 1992 WL 205666, at * 2, 1992 U.S.App. LEXIS 20581, at * 5 (7th Cir.  Aug. 20, 1992).  The district court had based Hudspeth's original sentence on Hudspeth's 1975 adjudication of juvenile delinquency for burglary, 1980 conviction for burglary, and 1983 convictions for three burglaries.  On remand, the government abandoned its reliance on Hudspeth's juvenile burglary, and focused on his three 1983 state convictions for burglary.  After the resentencing hearing, the district court concluded that Hudspeth had committed three prior burglaries \\\"on occasions different from one another\\\" and imposed the fifteen year minimum sentence required by the ACCA.\\n\\n\\n30\\nHudspeth argues that the district court's recalculation of his sentence after his resentencing hearing placed him in jeopardy twice for the same offense.17  He argues that the government improperly premised its request for an enhanced sentence on a version of Hudspeth's criminal conviction history different than the version presented at the original sentencing hearing.  This argument does not justify reversal.\\n\\n\\n31\\nHudspeth's argument is based on the government's reliance at resentencing on Hudspeth's three 1983 burglaries.  Hudspeth contends that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits the approach the government took here--initially premising its request for sentence enhancement on one version of Hudspeth's criminal conviction history and, at resentencing, premising its request for sentence enhancement on a second version.\\n\\n\\n32\\nSentencing matters do not ordinarily have the \\\"qualities of constitutional finality that attend an acquittal.\\\"  United States v. DiFrancesco, 449 U.S. 117, 134, 101 S.Ct. 426, 436, 66 L.Ed.2d 328 (1980).  As a result, recidivist statutes that impose enhanced sentences on repeat offenders generally do not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  See, e.g., Denton v. Duckworth, 873 F.2d 144, 147 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 941, 110 S.Ct. 341, 107 L.Ed.2d 330 (1989) (holding that the Double Jeopardy Clause was not violated by an Indiana recidivist statute that did not impose additional punishment for a past crime, but rather imposed additional punishment for the later crime).  The same reasoning upholds the constitutionality of sentence enhancement under the United States Sentencing Guidelines.  See, e.g., United States v. Duarte, 28 F.3d 47 (7th Cir.1994) (sentence enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1 did not raise double jeopardy concerns);  United States v. Shaw, 26 F.3d 700 (7th Cir.1994) (\\\"[A] sentence enhanced by reference to a prior conviction is not a 'second punishment for the first crime.'   It is a punishment for the new crime, tailored to the offender's circumstances in light of knowledge that higher penalties are needed to deter persons who have not responded to lesser sanctions\\\").\\n\\n\\n33\\nSentence enhancement for \\\"career criminals\\\" under the ACCA implicates no greater double jeopardy concerns than sentence enhancement under other recidivist statutes or the United States Sentencing Guidelines.  Enhanced sentences based on valid prior convictions that are within the appropriate sentencing range, as were both of Hudspeth's sentences, result in no double jeopardy violations.\\n\\n\\n34\\nThe government's change in tactics at Hudspeth's resentencing hearing, from reliance on Hudspeth's 1975, 1980 and 1983 offenses to reliance on only the 1983 convictions, does not alter our conclusion.  The Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrial of a defendant when the defendant's conviction is reversed because the government's evidence was insufficient to sustain the jury's verdict.  Burks v. United States, 437 U.S. 1, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978).  In contrast, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar retrial of a defendant when the defendant's conviction is set aside for trial error, such as erroneously admitted evidence.  Lockhart v. Nelson, 488 U.S. 33, 40, 109 S.Ct. 285, 290, 102 L.Ed.2d 265 (1988) (finding no double jeopardy violation where a defendant was resentenced based on an additional felony conviction not offered or admitted at original sentencing).\\n\\n\\n35\\nThe procedural error committed by the sentencing court at Hudspeth's initial sentencing hearing was simple trial error.  We remanded simply to ask the sentencing court to expand the record on evidence that had already been received.  A sentencing court's erroneous reliance on an insufficient record in imposing an enhanced sentence does not preclude correction of that sentence by a further review of the record.  We hold that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not preclude the recalculation of a defendant's sentence enhancement initially vacated for an insufficient record.\\n\\nIII.\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n36\\nWe hold that Hudspeth's 1983 convictions for three counts of burglary resulted from crimes \\\"committed on occasions different from one another\\\" and conclude that the district court's enhancement of Hudspeth's sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e)(1) was proper.  We also hold that the district court's recalculation of Hudspeth's sentence resulted in no double jeopardy violation.\\n\\nThe defendant's sentence is\\n\\n37\\nAFFIRMED.\\n\\n\\n38\\nBAUER, Circuit Judge, concurring.\\n\\n\\n39\\nI concur.  My concurrence is both simple and, as far as it goes, complete.  I believe the defendant was appropriately sentenced because, in my opinion, the record shows three separate crimes against separate victims and not a single crime or criminal occasion (whatever that is).\\n\\n\\n40\\nFLAUM, Circuit Judge, with whom POSNER, Chief Judge, and ROVNER, Circuit Judge, join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\\n\\n\\n41\\nAt its core, this case requires us to determine the meaning of the statutory language \\\"occasions different from one another,\\\" 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e)(1), a phrase that most of us agree is ambiguous.  The full court has divided roughly between those who believe the test of what is an \\\"occasion\\\" calls for a bright-line rule and those who believe that a fact-bound, case-by-case method is preferable.  I write separately to explain why I believe the latter approach is better suited to the inquiry we are asked to make.\\n\\n\\n42\\nThe statutory text and structure provide no clues as to precisely what Congress meant by the term \\\"occasions\\\";  Congress used the term without elaboration.  As the principal opinions note, in grappling with the ambiguity of the ACCA, we (and other courts) have held that a different \\\"occasion\\\" means a \\\"separate and distinct criminal episode,\\\" United States v. Godinez, 998 F.2d 471, 472 (7th Cir.1993);  United States v. Schieman, 894 F.2d 909, 913 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 856, 111 S.Ct. 155, 112 L.Ed.2d 121 (1990), but this refinement is only marginally less ambiguous than the statutory provision it explains.  The legislative history provides some illumination--we know that simultaneous crimes are to be counted as a single occasion--but not enough to dispose of this case as we are not told whether to make the negative inference that nonsimultaneous crimes cannot occur on one occasion.  In my view, the import of the post-Petty amendment to the ACCA is that Congress has spoken clearly to a particular factual scenario (several robberies accomplished by the same \\\"stick-em-up\\\"), but has otherwise left to the courts the task of giving meaning to the phrase \\\"committed on occasions different from one another.\\\"   Thus, the amendment does not resolve, once and for all, that all cases involving several crimes committed hard on the heels of one another, though not simultaneously, count as different criminal occasions.  Indeed, the snippet of legislative history cited in the majority opinion says as much--\\\"a single multi-count conviction could still qualify where the counts related to crimes committed on different occasions.\\\"   See supra at 14 (emphasis added).  Sequential crimes can, and often will, involve multiple occasions, but this need not always be the case.\\n\\n\\n43\\nThe majority concludes that Hudspeth ought to receive the ACCA enhancement on the basis of his three distinct aggressions against three separate victims in three separate locations.  This approach has the apparent virtue of drawing a bright-line (between simultaneous and sequential crimes) that would make the law more predictable for defendants and easier to apply for courts.*  For these reasons, Congress might rationally adopt such a rule, though I believe its mechanical application would lead to just as many, if not more, arbitrary results as a case-by-case approach would produce.  For example, compare Hudspeth's situation with that of a defendant who breaks into a small office building (one address, one owner, one insurance company) and then pries his way into three locked offices within that building, absconding with all of the electronic equipment and petty cash he can find.  It would be reasonable to conclude that Hudspeth and our hypothetical defendant are equally aggressive, dangerous, and culpable.  Both could have ceased after a single entry, but instead chose to expand their illegal activities to two additional locations before stopping (or being stopped).  Yet under the proposed bright-line rule, it is three strikes and you're out for Hudspeth while his more fortunate cohort remains in the batter's box with just one strike, though we can be reasonably certain that, like his brother in crime, Hudspeth sought cash and easily-fenced appliances and had no particular affinity for doughnuts, dry cleaning, or insurance--or knew or cared who owned what.\\n\\n\\n44\\nIn my view, the text, structure, and history of the ACCA neither compel nor suggest this particular (or any) bright-line rule.  Indeed, in view of the malleability of the relevant terms (\\\"occasions different from one another\\\" and \\\"separate and distinct criminal episode\\\"), see United States v. Balascsak, 873 F.2d 673 (3d Cir.1989) (en banc ), cert denied, 498 U.S. 864, 111 S.Ct. 173, 112 L.Ed.2d 138 (1990), I find it quite plausible that Congress declined to define them more precisely so that judges could decide what is an \\\"occasion\\\" by applying an ordinary, every-day meaning to the myriad factual scenarios that arise.  We have in the past rejected the notion that fact-dependent standards necessarily produce more inconsistent and arbitrary results than hard and fast rules, see Morgan v. Bank of Waukegan, 804 F.2d 970, 977 (7th Cir.1986), and we ought to do so again today.  \\\"[D]eveloping the law on a case-by-case basis and drawing lines depending on the facts is the stuff of judging,\\\" Balascsak, 873 F.2d at 685 (Becker, J., concurring), and over time this process shapes the contours of the law in such a way that future cases follow increasingly more predictably from those that preceded them.  For example, we know from Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970), and Petty that the simultaneous robbery of six persons counts as a single occasion while Schieman (involving an assault following a robbery) and Godinez (involving a kidnapping following a robbery) establish that one crime following soon after another can be a separate occasion.  These cases guide our analysis of the instant case, though, in my view, they are not dispositive because Hudspeth's actions fall within the gray area between what the earlier cases establish as single and multiple occasions.  While the lapse of time surely is an important factor in determining the number of \\\"occasions\\\" or \\\"episodes\\\", I read our cases to suggest that other practical considerations--whether the events in question reflect distinct aggressions or demonstrate heightened criminal culpability or dangerousness to society--also may be relevant.  See Godinez, 998 F.2d at 472-73.   Congress may, of course, amend the ACCA to guide courts with respect to what is an occasion, but unless and until it does, I believe that a nuanced, fact-based approach better resolves how many occasions are encompassed within a particular course of conduct.  In this case, I find that Hudspeth's actions, like those of the hypothetical defendant sketched above, were the product of a single aggression and I view the fact that Hudspeth and his partners entered several attached but separate stores at sequential addresses, as opposed to, for example, several departments of a single larger store, to be a mere fortuity in these circumstances.  In sum, I endorse Judge Ripple's fact-based approach and agree that we should reverse the sentence in this case.\\n\\n\\n45\\nRIPPLE, Circuit Judge, with whom POSNER, Chief Judge, and FAIRCHILD, FLAUM, and ROVNER, Circuit Judges, join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\\n\\n\\n46\\nThomas L. Hudspeth and several others broke into a shopping mall and, in thirty-six minutes' time, burglarized three stores.  A bobtailed1 en banc court holds that those thirty-six minutes qualify him as a career criminal.  Because I believe that this holding is contrary to the intent of the Congress and constitutes a significant departure from the approach this court has taken in previous cases, I respectfully dissent.\\n\\n\\n47\\n* BACKGROUND\\n\\n\\n48\\nA person who has a previous felony conviction may not legally possess a firearm.  18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g)(1).  If a prior felon is convicted of the unlawful possession of a firearm under this statutory provision and has the requisite prior criminal history, he is considered a \\\"career criminal\\\" and must be sentenced under the mandatory sentence enhancement section of the ACCA, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e)(1).\\n\\n\\n49\\nOn August 1, 1991, Mr. Hudspeth entered a plea of guilty to the charge of unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.  Prior to the plea agreement, the government had notified Mr. Hudspeth that it would seek, pursuant to Sec. 924(e)(1), the enhancement of his sentence to a term of imprisonment of not less than fifteen years with no possibility of parole.  In its Information Charging Prior Offense, filed July 8, 1991, the government listed three previous violent felony convictions, all committed in Sangamon County, Illinois:  (1) the August 8, 1983 conviction of three separate counts of burglary committed on March 27, 1983;  (2) the October 30, 1980 conviction of burglary;  and (3) the July 8, 1975 adjudication of juvenile delinquency for burglary.  Following acceptance of Mr. Hudspeth's guilty plea, the district court found that he was a career criminal subject to the sentence enhancement.2  Mr. Hudspeth appealed.\\n\\n\\n50\\nIn an unpublished order, a panel of this court vacated the sentence and remanded the case for a hearing with respect to the Sec. 924(e) enhancement.  United States v. Hudspeth, No. 91-3786, 1992 WL 205666 (7th Cir.  Aug. 20, 1992).  It specifically directed the district court to examine the facts surrounding the juvenile burglary and the three 1983 convictions in deciding whether Mr. Hudspeth was convicted of three violent felonies as defined by the statute.3  The court pointed out that, with respect to the 1983 burglaries at issue here, the record contained little information concerning the circumstances surrounding the commission of these crimes:\\n\\n\\n51\\nThe only information we have on the 1983 burglaries, however, is contained in the PSR, which summarily describes the burglaries as follows:  \\\"The defendant, Thomas Edwards, and Ronnie Edwards entered Homestyle Cleaners, Melocreme Donut, and Farmer's Insurance Company, all located in Springfield, Illinois.\\\"   Defendant-Appellant's Appendix, at 45.  This brief description of the burglaries does not reveal whether they took place on the same day or weeks apart, whether the burglarized businesses are in the same building or across town, or whether the crimes were connected in any way.  Further, the district court did not examine the facts surrounding these burglaries.  Consequently, we do not have sufficient information to discern whether the 1983 burglaries were part of the same or separate and distinct criminal episodes, and therefore cannot decide whether Hudspeth's sentence was properly enhanced under Sec. 924(e) (footnote omitted).\\n\\n\\n52\\nR.37 at 3.  The court further noted that the government had never suggested that these 1983 convictions ought to be counted separately for purposes of Sec. 924(e) until it amended its brief one week before oral argument in this court.  Characterizing the attempt to proceed in this court on a basis not urged in the district court as \\\"disturbing,\\\" the court admonished the government to state clearly the basis of the enhancement it was seeking during the remand proceedings in the district court.\\n\\n\\n53\\nOn remand, the government and district court focused only on the 1983 conviction of three counts of burglary.4  The pertinent facts are as follows.  Around 7:15 p.m. on March 27, 1983, Mr. Hudspeth and two others broke into three adjacent stores in the Laketown Shopping Center, a strip mall in Springfield, Illinois.  There is a factual ambiguity in the record as to the point of entry from the exterior of the mall.5  In just over one-half hour, they ransacked a doughnut shop, a cleaning business, and an insurance agency.  A hole had been punched into the wall between the cleaners and the doughnut shop, allowing passage between those stores, and the door between the doughnut shop and the insurance company had been opened.  In the cleaners was a canvas bag containing such tools as chisels, screwdrivers, pry bars, a pipe wrench and a small sledgehammer.  Mr. Hudspeth was arrested in the doughnut shop.\\n\\n\\n54\\nAfter the resentencing hearing, the district court concluded that the burglaries in the mall constituted three \\\"separate crimes against separate victims in separate locations.\\\"   The court reasoned that the defendant \\\"could have stopped after one burglary but he consciously made a decision to break through the walls and burglarize one business after another.\\\"   Order of Feb. 1, 1993, R.51 at 2.  On that basis, the court held that Mr. Hudspeth qualified for the Sec. 924(e) enhancement.\\n\\nII\\n\\n55\\nMr. Hudspeth asserts that the recalculation of his sentence placed him in jeopardy twice for the same offense.6  If he is correct, the Double Jeopardy Clause bars his resentencing, and it would be unnecessary to consider further the other matters raised on appeal.  Accordingly, I address this issue first.  A double jeopardy allegation is a legal question which we review de novo.  United States v. Furlett, 974 F.2d 839, 842 (7th Cir.1992).\\n\\n1.\\n\\n56\\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause provides that no person shall \\\"be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\\\"   U.S. Const., amend.  V.  The Clause \\\"affords a defendant three basic protections:  ' \\\"[It] protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal.  It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction.  And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\\\" ' \\\"  Ohio v. Johnson, 467 U.S. 493, 498, 104 S.Ct. 2536, 2540, 81 L.Ed.2d 425 (1984) (citations omitted).  In this latter regard, the Double Jeopardy Clause ensures that \\\"sentencing courts do not exceed, by the device of multiple punishments, the limits prescribed by the legislative branch of government, in which lies the substantive power to define crimes and prescribe punishments.\\\"  Jones v. Thomas, 491 U.S. 376, 381, 109 S.Ct. 2522, 2525-26, 105 L.Ed.2d 322 (1989).  Courts may not impose multiple punishments for the same offense in excess of the total punishment authorized by the legislature.  United States v. Halper, 490 U.S. 435, 450-51, 109 S.Ct. 1892, 1902-03, 104 L.Ed.2d 487 (1989).\\n\\n2.\\n\\n57\\nAt the outset, it is necessary to clarify the precise issue before the court by addressing several threshold matters raised by Mr. Hudspeth.  First, no additional factual bases were proffered by the government at resentencing.  Both the sentence initially imposed upon Mr. Hudspeth and the sentence imposed after remand from this court were based upon the same factual predicate;  no other convictions or other aspects of Mr. Hudspeth's past criminal history were included for the first time in the resentencing calculations.  Second, Mr. Hudspeth's claim that he was uninformed of the prior offenses is without merit.  The Information Charging Prior Offenses adequately notified the defendant of the predicate convictions on which the government relied for purposes of enhancement.  This information was filed on July 8, 1991, eighteen days after the indictment was returned and twenty-three days before Mr. Hudspeth signed the plea agreement.  It stated that these prior convictions would justify enhancement of Mr. Hudspeth's sentence under Sec. 924(e) if he were convicted.  The plea agreement, which Mr. Hudspeth signed, also listed the predicate convictions.  Through these steps, the government clearly gave the defendant adequate notice of the prior convictions upon which it sought enhancement.7  The Supreme Court's decision in Oyler v. Boles, 368 U.S. 448, 82 S.Ct. 501, 7 L.Ed.2d 446 (1962), upon which Mr. Hudspeth relies, requires that the defendant \\\"receive reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard relative to the recidivist charge.\\\"  Id. at 452, 82 S.Ct. at 504.   The government met its burden by providing timely notice (the Information Charging Prior Offenses) and proof of the validity of the prior convictions.  Mr. Hudspeth had the opportunity to contest the record as to his prior convictions both before signing the plea agreement and at the sentencing hearing.  He had a further opportunity to challenge the government's position concerning the 1983 burglary conviction during the proceedings upon remand.  Mr. Hudspeth's threshold allegations are without merit.\\n\\n3.\\n\\n58\\nI now turn to Mr. Hudspeth's principal contention with respect to the Double Jeopardy Clause.  In his view, by \\\"unbundling\\\" the 1983 conviction on remand, the government initially premised its request for enhancement of the sentence on one version of his criminal conviction history and then, on remand, premised a second request for enhancement on a second version.\\n\\n\\n59\\nAt the outset, I note that, although the precise contours of the protection against double jeopardy in the non-capital sentencing context may not be entirely settled,8 existing caselaw makes it highly unlikely that the Double Jeopardy Clause is implicated in the situation at hand.  As the Supreme Court pointedly noted in United States v. DiFrancesco, 449 U.S. 117, 134, 101 S.Ct. 426, 436, 66 L.Ed.2d 328 (1980), a sentencing matter does not ordinarily have the \\\"qualities of constitutional finality that attend an acquittal.\\\"   As a general rule, therefore, the caselaw has maintained that recidivist statutes imposing enhanced sentences on repeat offenders do not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Spencer v. Texas, 385 U.S. 554, 559-60, 87 S.Ct. 648, 651, 17 L.Ed.2d 606 (1967);9  Denton v. Duckworth, 873 F.2d 144, 147 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 941, 110 S.Ct. 341, 107 L.Ed.2d 330 (1989);10  United States v. Vigil, 818 F.2d 738, 742 (10th Cir.1987);11  United States v. Pleasant, 730 F.2d 657, 662 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 869, 105 S.Ct. 216, 83 L.Ed.2d 146 (1984);12  United States v. Bowdach, 561 F.2d 1160, 1176 (5th Cir.1977).13  This court has clearly stated that sentence enhancement under the Sentencing Guidelines does not create multiple punishments for a crime in violation of the double jeopardy clause.  United States v. Duarte, 28 F.3d 47, 48 (7th Cir.1994) (finding no double jeopardy in U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1 obstruction of justice enhancement);  United States v. Shaw, 26 F.3d 700, 701 (7th Cir.1994) (finding no error in use of prior conviction to enhance another sentence because it is not a \\\"second punishment\\\" for the first crime);  United States v. Saunders, 973 F.2d 1354, 1365 (7th Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1026, 122 L.Ed.2d 171 (1993) (holding that calculation of sentence within statutory range does not constitute multiple punishment);  accord United States v. Howard, 998 F.2d 42, 48-49 (2d Cir.1993) (holding that cumulative punishments upon recidivist defendants do not violate Double Jeopardy Clause).\\n\\n\\n60\\nI do not believe there is any reason to treat differently \\\"career criminal\\\" sentence enhancement under the ACCA.  In this case, both the original and second sentences were within the sentencing range and were made on the basis of the same predicate convictions.  The statutory scheme is designed to remove from society for a longer period of time those individuals who have demonstrated, because of their recurring violent behavior, that they are an unusual danger to others.\\n\\n\\n61\\nNor do I agree that the fact that the government, on remand, for the first time characterized the convictions based on the events of March 27, 1983 as three episodes necessarily alters the above analysis and implicates the strictures of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  However, even if I were to assume arguendo that the Double Jeopardy Clause is applicable in this situation, my analysis would be guided by the decision of the Supreme Court in Lockhart v. Nelson, 488 U.S. 33, 109 S.Ct. 285, 102 L.Ed.2d 265 (1988).  In Nelson, the trial court, sentencing the defendant under a state habitual criminal statute,14 admitted evidence of four felony convictions.  It was discovered later that one of the offenses had been pardoned.  When the State announced its intention to resentence the defendant as an habitual offender on the basis of a conviction not offered or admitted at the original sentencing hearing, the defendant raised the defense of double jeopardy.  Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the Court, noted that, in Burks v. United States, 437 U.S. 1, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978), the Court had recognized an exception to the general rule that double jeopardy does not bar retrial when a defendant has succeeded in getting his conviction set aside for error in the earlier proceedings.  Id. at 39, 109 S.Ct. at 290.  Burks held that, when a defendant's conviction is reversed on the ground of insufficient evidence to sustain the jury's verdict, the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a retrial on the same charge because such a holding amounts to a determination that the trial court should have entered a judgment of acquittal on the ground of insufficient evidence.  The Chief Justice concluded that the \\\"logic of Burks \\\" requires that the Double Jeopardy Clause not bar retrial when a reviewing court determines that a conviction must be reversed because evidence was admitted erroneously and, without that evidence, the defendant could not have been convicted due to insufficient evidence.  Id. at 40, 109 S.Ct. at 290.   He wrote:\\n\\n\\n62\\nBurks was careful to point out that a reversal based solely on evidentiary insufficiency has fundamentally different implications, for double jeopardy purposes, than a reversal based on such ordinary \\\"trial errors\\\" as the \\\"incorrect receipt or rejection of evidence.\\\"  437 U.S. at 14-16, [98 S.Ct. at 2148-50].  While the former is in effect a finding \\\"that the government has failed to prove its case\\\" against the defendant, the latter \\\"implies nothing with respect to the guilt or innocence of the defendant,\\\" but is simply \\\"a determination that [he] has been convicted through a judicial process which is defective in some fundamental respect.\\\"  Id. at 15, 98 S.Ct. at 2149 (emphasis added).\\n\\n\\n63\\nNelson, 488 U.S. at 40, 109 S.Ct. at 290.   He further explained that \\\"[t]he fact that one of the convictions had been later pardoned by the Governor vitiated its legal effect, but it did not deprive the certified copy of that conviction of its probative value under the statute.\\\"  Id.  In the Court's view, the admission of the pardoned conviction therefore amounted to \\\"trial error.\\\"\\n\\n\\n64\\nPermitting retrial in this instance is not the sort of governmental oppression at which the Double Jeopardy Clause is aimed;  rather, it serves the interest of the defendant by affording him an opportunity to \\\"obtai[n] a fair readjudication of his guilt free from error.\\\"\\n\\n\\n65\\nId. at 42, 109 S.Ct. at 291 (quoting Burks, 437 U.S. at 15, 98 S.Ct. at 2149).\\n\\n\\n66\\nThe circumstances creating trial error in Nelson are similar, although not identical,15 to those now before this court.  In Nelson, a defendant pleaded guilty to burglary and was sentenced under the state's habitual criminal statute.  Prior felony convictions were introduced at the sentencing hearing.  A subsequent issue concerning one of those prior convictions arose after sentencing--the pardon of one of the convictions.  At that point the government announced that it intended to rely on another prior conviction not offered or admitted at the initial sentencing hearing.  In this case, however, the subsequent issue was the insufficiency of the information about Mr. Hudspeth's predicate convictions.  Also in this case, unlike in Nelson, the government relied on the convictions introduced in the earlier proceeding;  it simply characterized the 1983 burglary conviction as three separate and distinct episodes justifying enhancement.\\n\\n\\n67\\nAs in Nelson, the procedural error from Mr. Hudspeth's first sentencing was simple trial error.  We remanded because the information presented by the district court to the court of appeals was insufficient to discern the propriety of the enhancement, not because the evidence presented by the government was insufficient to support a conviction.  We requested an expansion of the record on the evidence that had already been received.  A sentencing court's failure to present an adequate record of the evidence used for enhancement of the sentence does not lead to the type of sentence correction that is barred by double jeopardy.  This is not a \\\"case of the state getting a second chance to prove something it had failed to prove the first time, the heart of double jeopardy's bar.\\\"  Tate v. Armontrout, 914 F.2d 1022, 1026-27 (8th Cir.1990) (concluding that an insufficient record was trial error);  see also Linam v. Griffin, 685 F.2d 369, 374 (10th Cir.1982) (holding that double jeopardy does not bar retrial when evidence is incorrectly excluded), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1211, 103 S.Ct. 1207, 75 L.Ed.2d 447 (1983).\\n\\n\\n68\\nIn reaching the conclusion that the Double Jeopardy Clause is not violated by the reconsideration of the three convictions entered in the original proceeding, I follow a path analogous to that set out in this court's decision in Denton v. Duckworth, 873 F.2d 144, 148 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 941, 110 S.Ct. 341, 107 L.Ed.2d 330 (1989).  There we concluded that, assuming that the Double Jeopardy Clause applies, it does not bar redetermination of a defendant's status as an habitual offender under the Indiana habitual offender statute when the basis of that remand is trial error.  Today, again assuming the applicability of the Clause, I conclude that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not affect the recalculation of a sentence enhancement that was vacated for an insufficient record, a trial error.  Therefore, there was no double jeopardy violation in the redetermination of Mr. Hudspeth's status as a career criminal under Sec. 924(e) of the ACCA.\\n\\nIII\\n\\n69\\nMr. Hudspeth contends that the 1983 burglaries of three adjoining stores in the same building within thirty-six minutes was a single project and therefore must, as a matter of law, constitute a single episode for purposes of the Sec. 924(e) enhancement.16  The government responds that the burglaries constituted separate entries into three separate stores and included an independent choice to continue on after each burglary.\\n\\n\\n70\\nThe ACCA requires that a series of determinations be made before its heavy penalties are imposed:  The offender must be a felon convicted of illegal possession of a firearm, and thus in violation of Sec. 922(g), and must have had three previous convictions for a violent felony and/or serious drug offense which were committed on occasions different from one another under Sec. 924(e).  When these statutory requirements are met, the offender is categorized as a career criminal and the mandatory enhanced sentence of not less than fifteen years of imprisonment without eligibility for parole, probation, or suspended sentence is imposed.17\\n\\n\\n71\\nFrom the beginning, the purpose of this statute has been clear.  Congress intended to devise a mechanism that would identify the offender whose repeated aggressions against society pose a special danger to law-abiding persons and would isolate that person from society for a longer period of time.  See Armed Career Criminal Act:  Hearing on H.R. 1627 and S. 52 Before the Subcomm. on Crime of the House Judiciary Comm., 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 12-13 (1984) (setting forth Senator Specter's comments that Act was promulgated to punish habitual offenders);  S.Rep. No. 585, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 20 (1982) (discussing congressional intent to punish the small number of repeat offenders committing most of the violent crime in America).  The decision of the Eighth Circuit in United States v. Petty, 798 F.2d 1157 (8th Cir.1986), vacated, 481 U.S. 1034, 107 S.Ct. 1968, 95 L.Ed.2d 810 (1987) was the early case that focused attention on the purpose of the statute.  Petty robbed six persons in a restaurant at the same time.  The Eighth Circuit initially held that the loss to six different victims constituted six different offenses and therefore required an enhancement of the sentence.  The Supreme Court vacated the judgment and instructed the appellate court to reconsider in view of the Solicitor General's position that offenses should be counted separately only if they occurred at different times, and that \\\"career criminal\\\" status should reflect a history of \\\"multiple criminal episodes\\\" rather than multiple convictions arising from a single \\\"episode.\\\"  Petty, 481 U.S. at 1034-35, 107 S.Ct. at 1968-69.   On remand, the Eighth Circuit adopted that approach and held that the simultaneous robberies created one criminal episode.  United States v. Petty, 828 F.2d 2, 3 (8th Cir.1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1057, 108 S.Ct. 2827, 100 L.Ed.2d 928 (1988).  Our colleagues in the Eighth Circuit noted, \\\"the legislative history [of the ACCA] strongly supports the conclusion that the statute was intended to reach multiple criminal episodes that were distinct in time, not multiple felony convictions arising out of a single criminal episode.\\\"  Petty, 828 F.2d at 3.\\n\\n\\n72\\nA subsequent amendment made clear that the position of the Solicitor General was indeed correct.  Congress specifically directed that the predicate felonies be \\\"committed on occasions different from one another.\\\"   Senator Joseph Biden, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, explained the amendment of the ACCA by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub.L. No. 100-690, section 7056, 102 Stat. 4181, 4402 (1988):\\n\\n\\n73\\nUnder the amendment, the three previous convictions would have to be for offenses \\\"committed [on] occasions different from one another.\\\"   Thus, a single multicount conviction could still qualify where the counts related to crimes committed on different occasions, but a robbery of multiple victims simultaneously (as in Petty) would count as only one conviction.  This interpretation plainly expresses that concept of what is meant by a \\\"career criminal,\\\" that is, a person who over the course of time commits three or more of the enumerated kinds of felonies and is convicted therefor.  It is appropriate to clarify the statute ... to insure that its rigorous sentencing provisions apply only as intended in cases meriting such strict punishment.\\n\\n\\n74\\n134 Cong.Rec. S17,370 (daily ed. Nov. 10, 1988).\\n\\n\\n75\\nThis amendment does not provide an answer on the cold print of the statute books to the fact-specific case before us.  However, when read with the rest of the legislative history and the interpretation given the statute by the Supreme Court, the congressional objective can hardly be in doubt.  The Supreme Court, reviewing the legislative history of the ACCA, noted the aim of the Act at recidivist defendants:\\n\\n\\n76\\n[T]hroughout the history of the enhancement provision, Congress focused its efforts on career offenders--those who commit a large number of fairly serious crimes as their means of livelihood, and who, because they possess weapons, present at least a potential threat of harm to persons.\\n\\n\\n77\\nTaylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 587-88, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2152, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990);  Chief Judge Posner has described a career criminal as \\\"incorrigible, undeterrable, recidivating, unresponsive to the 'specific deterrence' of having been previously convicted.\\\"  United States v. Belton, 890 F.2d 9, 10 (7th Cir.1989) (considering career offender enhancement under U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.1), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 391, 121 L.Ed.2d 299 (1992).\\n\\n\\n78\\nUntil today, our decisions have reflected a thoughtful and measured approach to the task required by the statute--identifying those criminals whose repetitive behavior requires a special degree of isolation from society.  Our previous decisions in this area, and, indeed, the previous decisions of the other circuits, have attempted to fulfill the congressional mandate by a progressive refinement of the methodology to be employed by the trial courts in determining whether the previous crimes of the defendant constitute a single episode or multiple episodes.  In United States v. Schieman, 894 F.2d 909, 912 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 856, 111 S.Ct. 155, 112 L.Ed.2d 121 (1990), we adopted, through the pen of Judge Bauer, the \\\"separate and distinct criminal episode\\\" test to determine whether the defendant's prior felonies were committed on different occasions as required by Sec. 924(e).  Id. at 913.   Our later cases have continued to apply this test.18  The vast majority of other courts of appeals have also adopted it.19  The application of the \\\"separate and distinct episodes\\\" test has, of necessity, been quite fact specific.  Yet, when assessed in its entirety, the caselaw reflects both an awareness that Congress' intent in enacting the section was to punish recidivist behavior and the reality that such recidivism can be manifest in relatively short time frames and in situations not far removed from each other.20  These cases demonstrate that courts usually have counted separately all convictions (or counts within a conviction) that occurred at distinct times or involved different locations or distinguishable criminal schemes.  By contrast, a crime involving multiple offenses occurring simultaneously has been held to be a single episode counting as a single conviction under Sec. 924(e)(1).21  Factors of time and distance must be evaluated in terms of the legislative intent in order to identify and segregate the true recidivist.\\n\\n\\n79\\nThe next significant attempt to refine further our effort to fulfill the congressional mandate occurred in United States v. Godinez, 998 F.2d 471 (7th Cir.1993).  In that case, Judge Easterbrook's analysis made it clear that the distinction between one and multiple episodes must, in order to reflect accurately the congressional intent, be a practical distinction rather than a metaphysical one.  In Godinez, the defendant kidnapped a woman in order to use her car in a robbery.  After leaving her tied up in his apartment, the defendant proceeded to rob a convenience store.  The court emphasized that the starting point in the analysis must be the language of the statute;  that language directs the implementation of the enhanced punishment scheme when the crimes took place \\\"on occasions different from one another.\\\"  Id. at 472.   In an attempt to deal with the recurring problem of proximity in time or distance, the court held that, in order to constitute a separate episode, the crimes must reflect distinct aggressions.  In fashioning this approach, the court noted with approval the analysis of the Second Circuit in United States v. Towne, 870 F.2d 880, 888-91 (2d.  Cir.), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1101, 109 S.Ct. 2456, 104 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1989).  The Second Circuit found that a defendant's kidnapping and rape of one victim were \\\"part of a continuous course of conduct which was directed at a single victim,\\\" even though there were different felonies committed with some period of time between the two crimes.  Thus the attacks were a single criminal episode.  Id. at 891.   Judge Easterbrook contrasted Godinez's crimes against different victims, in different places, more than an hour apart:  \\\"It would strain language considerably, without serving any purpose plausibly attributed to Congress, to treat the kidnapping and the robbery as a single 'occasion.' \\\"  Godinez, 998 F.2d at 473.\\n\\n\\n80\\nIn a very short period of time, Mr. Hudspeth and his accomplices, with a sledgehammer and other tools, broke into three adjoining businesses in one location and ransacked them.  Their arrival with such tools designed to expedite the penetration of the walls between the adjacent businesses reflects a clear plan for the group to work together to break through from one business to another.  This venture did not comprise \\\"distinct aggressions,\\\" id., but rather a singular, continuous course of conduct that depended on the spatial proximity of these stores.  To characterize this venture as a single criminal act that, after reflection, Mr. Hudspeth and his cohorts chose to extend into a second and then a third shop requires that we ignore the counsel of Godinez that such assessments be based on the practical realities of the situation rather than on the metaphysical possibility that, at any given point in the activity, one of the perpetrators might have had a change of heart.  Indeed, as the differences of opinion in the police reports reflect, the record does not establish any particular sequence to the perpetrators' activity, much less any deliberate choice on their part.\\n\\n\\n81\\nThe majority asserts that the facts of this case are virtually identical to the circumstances in United States v. Tisdale, 921 F.2d 1095 (10th Cir.1990), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 596, 116 L.Ed.2d 619 (1991).  Indeed, there are clear superficial similarities. In Tisdale, the burglar broke into three stores in one mall in one evening.  The Tenth Circuit held that breaking and entering of the three separate stores within the mall were burglaries of separate locations that could not occur simultaneously.  Moreover, concluded the court, because the defendant chose to continue his burglaries after successfully completing one, he had engaged in separate criminal episodes.  Id. at 1099.   The court's rather terse treatment of the issue makes it difficult to assess with any accuracy whether the cases are similar beyond the fact that they both involve break-ins in a shopping mall in one evening.  It is not difficult to conceive of a situation in which the location of the stores to each other, the time involved, and the modus operandi would make it clear that more than one aggression took place.  Tisdale, therefore, may present, for purposes of the ACCA, a very different situation from the one before us.  If, on the other hand, it is factually indistinguishable from our case, I suggest that it cannot fit within the analysis that we carefully have developed over the years to identify recidivist behavior and to deal with it as Congress has mandated.  Here, the contiguous layout of the stores, the very short time involved in the execution of the entire plan, and the fact that the thieves treated the operation, both in its planning and its execution, as a unitary matter make it, for purposes of fulfilling the congressional intent, similar to the robbery of the six restaurant patrons in Petty.   It stretches both the English language and the realities of the situation to conclude that this situation was anything other than a single occasion.\\n\\n\\n82\\nToday, the court abandons the careful, thoughtful work-product of its past decisions in favor of an approach that, superficially, presents a more \\\"bright-line\\\" approach.  It does so at a great price--abandonment of the congressional mandate that the statute be used to identify the true recidivist and to treat that person differently because of the special danger that person poses to the rest of us.  The abandonment of our precedent is even more regrettable when one reflects on the future course of litigation in this area.  The majority appears to admit that the assailant who enters an apartment with an automatic weapon and shoots several people with one burst of his weapon is not subject to the provisions of this statute.  On the other hand, if he takes several steps around a room divider and shoots several others, the statute becomes operative because, at least in some metaphysical sense, he had time to think about the second pull of the trigger.  The crimes described above no doubt deserve severe punishment.  However, it is difficult to see, and Congress certainly did not intend, that one, but not the other, individual be treated as a recidivist.\\n\\n\\n83\\nBright-line mechanistic devices have a place in the law.  However, when Congress requires, as it clearly has here, that we distinguish between individuals committed to repetitive acts of violence and those who have not shown such a pattern in their lives, mechanistic tests may simplify the task, but they also make it a great deal less accurate.  Here the court has chosen the easy approach that also, undoubtedly, will bring more individuals within the ambit of the statute.  Our task, however, is not to stretch the statutory language, but to be responsive to the will of the Congress.  The majority has chosen a course that will not fulfill that objective.  Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\\n\\n\\n\\n*\\n The opinion was originally released in typescript\\n\\n\\n**\\n Judge Fairchild is participating in this en banc decision because he was a member of the three-judge panel which heard this case.  See Allen v. Johnson, 391 F.2d 527 (5th Cir.1968) (en banc )\\n\\n\\n***\\n When this case was orally argued and considered by the court on June 4, 1994, Judge Cudahy was in regular active service.  He participated in both the oral argument and the en banc conference.  He subsequently approved Judge Ripple's opinion, then believed to be the prospective majority opinion, and filed a special concurrence supporting reversal of the judgment of the district court.  On August 15, 1994, Judge Cudahy attained senior status.  He has read United States v. American-Foreign S.S. Corp., 363 U.S. 685, 80 S.Ct. 1336, 4 L.Ed.2d 1491 (1960), interpreting 28 U.S.C. Sec. 371(b), as disqualifying him from further participation in this case because he had become a senior judge.  See Latin American Citizens Council v. Clements, 914 F.2d 620, 622 n. *  (5th Cir.1990) (en banc) (statement of Judge Reavley);  United States v. Anderson, 885 F.2d 1248, 1249 n. *  (5th Cir.1989) (en banc) (statement of Judge Rubin).  This view has now been confirmed by an opinion of this court, and Judge Cudahy has withdrawn his prior vote and special concurrence and is no longer a participant in this case\\n\\n\\n1\\n It is a federal crime for any person \\\"who has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;  ...  to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition.\\\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g)(1)\\n\\n\\n2\\n The penalty for violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g) in the absence of three prior violent felony convictions is imprisonment for not more than ten years.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(a)(2)\\n\\n\\n3\\n In Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 600-01, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2159-60, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), the Supreme Court limited sentencing courts in deciding whether an offense is a \\\"violent felony\\\" under the ACCA, to looking only at the statutory definition of the prior offense and not to the particular facts underlying the conviction.  However, Taylor does not preclude a sentencing court from examining the factual underpinnings of a defendant's prior convictions in order that it might properly apply the ACCA and determine if multiple offenses occurred on one or more \\\"occasions.\\\"   As a practical matter, a district court frequently must look beyond the charging papers and judgment of conviction for these documents alone rarely provide the district court with the detailed information necessary (i.e., time, victim, location) to determine whether multiple offenses occurred on one or more \\\"occasions.\\\"   A district court's examination of the factual basis for a defendant's prior convictions does not amount to a retrial of those crimes as prohibited in Custis v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994).  The sentencing court is not being called upon to second-guess valid state court convictions, rather, it is merely determining whether the three valid convictions resulted from one occasion or more than one occasion.  Thus, the district court and this court have examined the police reports to accurately determine the facts of the three burglaries\\n\\n\\n4\\n Federal courts must give credence to state court convictions.  See Custis, --- U.S. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 1736 (\\\"prior convictions used for sentence enhancement purposes under Sec. 924(e) are not subject to collateral attack in the sentence proceeding\\\")\\n\\n\\n5\\n Hudspeth was arrested in the doughnut shop\\n\\n\\n6\\n According to United States v. Gallman, 907 F.2d 639, 643 (7th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 908, 111 S.Ct. 1110, 113 L.Ed.2d 219 (1991) and United States v. Redding, 16 F.3d 298, 302 (8th Cir.1994), under Sec. 924(e)(1), the government must establish that a defendant has three prior violent felony convictions.  A certified record of conviction or a presentence investigation report, if not challenged, will normally satisfy this showing.  Redding, 16 F.3d at 302;  United States v. Ruo, 943 F.2d 1274, 1276 (11th Cir.1991).  The burden then shifts to the defendant to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the prior convictions occurred on a single \\\"occasion,\\\" and thus cannot be the basis for sentence enhancement under Sec. 924(e)(1).  See Redding, 16 F.3d at 302 (defendant bears the burden of proving that prior convictions cannot be used for sentence enhancement)\\n\\n\\n7\\n While we realize that the issue in this appeal is whether the three burglaries occurred on one \\\"occasion\\\" or more than one \\\"occasion,\\\" it is interesting to note that these three burglaries are not the only offenses for which Hudspeth has been convicted.  The Presentence Report reveals that as a juvenile in 1975, Hudspeth was adjudicated delinquent on two counts of burglary, one count of theft and one count of using an intoxicant.  In 1979 as an adult, Hudspeth pled guilty to one count of theft and was sentenced to 60 days in jail and 30 months probation.  In 1980, while on probation from the 1979 conviction, he was charged with and pled guilty to one count of burglary and was sentenced to four years of incarceration.  In 1982, Hudspeth pled guilty to one count of trespassing and one count of resisting arrest.  He was fined $250.  Later in 1982, he was charged with and pled guilty to another count of resisting a peace officer and was sentenced to 30 days in jail.  In 1983, Hudspeth pled guilty to the three burglaries of the strip mall and was sentenced to four years of confinement.  Finally, in 1986, he was sentenced to two years of incarceration after pleading guilty to two counts of unlawful use of a firearm by a felon\\nIt is quite evident that Hudspeth is precisely the type of career criminal at whom the ACCA is directed.  Nonetheless, the mandatory fifteen-year minimum sentence applies only if Hudspeth's three burglaries in 1983 are determined to have been \\\"committed on occasions different from one another\\\" because, other than his 1980 burglary conviction, his other prior offense was an adjudication of juvenile delinquency, which does not count under the ACCA unless it involved a violent felony.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e)(2)(C).\\n\\n\\n8\\n The three burglaries on March 27, 1983, occurred at three separate addresses:  Farmers Insurance Company was at 1810 Stevenson Drive, Melo Creme Doughnut was located at 1814 Stevenson Drive, and Homestyle Cleaners was at 1816 Stevenson Drive.  Presumably each business owner paid separate rent and taxes and filed separate insurance claims for the damage Hudspeth caused.  See Tisdale, 921 F.2d at 1099 (\\\"[t]he fact each incident occurred inside one enclosed structure [a mall] does not alter our conclusion that the crimes were committed at different locations \\\") (emphasis added)\\n\\n\\n9\\n The police reports reveal that Hudspeth and his two accomplices entered the first business establishment at approximately 7:20 p.m. and the police officers apprehended the burglars at approximately 7:55 p.m. while they were in the process of burglarizing a fourth business\\n\\n\\n10\\n For instance a single drug sale may result in a multiple count indictment charging a defendant with (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute narcotics (21 U.S.C. Sec. 846);  (2) possession with intent to distribute narcotics (21 U.S.C. Sec. 841);  (3) possession of a firearm during commission of a drug offense (18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(1));  (4) sale of narcotics within 1000 feet of a school (21 U.S.C. Sec. 860);  and (5) involving a person under 18 years of age in a drug transaction (21 U.S.C. Sec. 861)\\n\\n\\n11\\n The police reports do not establish with any certainty the sequence of the burglaries or the precise means of entry.  However, for the purposes of this appeal, the order of and methods used to effect each entry are immaterial;  regardless of order, the second and third burglaries were committed sequentially to one another\\n\\n\\n12\\n Chief Judge Posner asked at oral argument whether the court should impose different sentences for the burglar who breaks into three houses that are separated by six inches of airspace and the burglar who breaks into three row houses that share a wall.  Clearly, enhancing the sentence of one of these burglars and not the other would lead to an absurd result.  The true inquiry is whether the crimes were committed in succession to one another.  A defendant who commits three crimes sequentially will have made three distinct and deliberate choices to commit a crime.  Hudspeth clearly committed three sequential crimes against three separate victims in three separate locations\\nJudge Bauer presented another hypothetical at oral argument to clarify the Schieman standard.  He inquired of the Assistant U.S. Attorney (\\\"AUSA\\\") if a gunman entered a room and murdered seven people in the room whether that was one occasion or seven occasions.  The AUSA, relying on United States v. Petty, 828 F.2d 2 (8th Cir.1987), responded that it would probably be one occasion.  Judge Bauer inquired further if the gunman entered seven different rooms and murdered one person in each room whether that constituted one occasion or seven occasions for purposes of the ACCA.  The AUSA argued that situation constituted seven occasions because the intervening time as the gunman marched from room to room permitted him to determine whether to cease or continue with his murderous spree.\\n\\n\\n13\\n Resort to legislative history is usually selective and thus of little value if any when interpreting a statute.  See Holder v. Hall --- U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2581, 2612, 129 L.Ed.2d 687 (1994) (legislative history \\\"is read selectively to support the result the Court intends to achieve\\\") (Thomas, J., concurring);  see also Conroy v. Aniskoff, --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 1562, 1567, 123 L.Ed.2d 229 (1993) (\\\"The greatest defect of legislative history is its illegitimacy.  We are governed by laws, not by the intentions of legislators....  If one were to search for an interpretive technique that, on the whole, was more likely to confuse than to clarify, one could hardly find a more promising candidate than legislative history.\\\")  (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment) (emphasis added)\\n\\n\\n14\\n A number of circuit courts have held that the language of Sec. 924(e)(1) is unambiguous in that a defendant's conviction for one predicate offense need not precede the commission of the next predicate offense to trigger sentence enhancement under the ACCA.  See United States v. Anderson, 921 F.2d 335, 339-40 (1st Cir.1990) (\\\"we view the plain language of the statute ... as dispositive\\\");  United States v. Mason, 954 F.2d 219, 221-22 (4th Cir.1991) (\\\"[w]e do not agree that the statute is ambiguous\\\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1979, 118 L.Ed.2d 578 (1992);  United States v. Mitchell, 932 F.2d 1027, 1028 (2d Cir.1991) (per curiam ) (\\\"this language unambiguously requires that a defendant's three convictions stem from three, separate criminal episodes ... [and] does not require that a defendant's three criminal acts be punctuated by intervening convictions\\\")\\n\\n\\n15\\n The Eighth Circuit subsequently reconsidered its decision in Petty, and concluded that Petty's six convictions for robbery occurred on a single \\\"occasion\\\" under the ACCA.  United States v. Petty, 828 F.2d 2, 3 (8th Cir.1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1057, 108 S.Ct. 2827, 100 L.Ed.2d 928 (1988)\\n\\n\\n16\\n The plain meaning of the term \\\"occasion\\\" incorporates a temporal distinction, i.e., one occasion cannot be simultaneous with another occasion.  Black's Law Dictionary defines an occasion as a \\\"particular time.\\\"   Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines an occasion as \\\"a particular time at which something takes place:  a time marked by some happening.\\\"   See also Tisdale, 921 F.2d at 1099 (\\\"[a] plain reading of the statutory language of Sec. 924(e)(1), 'occasions different from one another', supports the conclusion that Congress intended the three predicate offenses to be distinct in time\\\")\\n\\n\\n17\\n Hudspeth also argues that the government violated his right to due process in that he received inadequate notice of the offenses on which his enhanced sentence was based.  The Supreme Court has held that a defendant must \\\"receive reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard relative to [any] recidivist charge.\\\"  Oyler v. Boles, 368 U.S. 448, 452, 82 S.Ct. 501, 504, 7 L.Ed.2d 446 (1962).  Hudspeth's contention that the notice he received was not \\\"reasonable\\\" is unsupported by the record.  The Information Charging Prior Offenses, which was filed eighteen days after the return of the indictment and twenty-three days before Hudspeth signed the plea agreement, gave Hudspeth adequate notice of the prior convictions on which the government based its request for an enhanced sentence.  Hudspeth's argument that he received inadequate notice is altogether without merit\\n\\n\\n*\\n But is this such a bright line after all--or does it simply substitute one ambiguity for another?   Consider the burglar who enters a home and pilfers the television from the family room, the candlesticks from the living room, and some jewelry from the bedroom.  Has he acted simultaneously or sequentially?   Clearly he cannot grab all of these objects with one clean scoop of the arm (nor could one acting without the benefit of specialized equipment or a contortionist's talents rob or shoot six victims at precisely the same instant), and the proper characterization of the burglar's acts will turn on how much time we will tolerate between so-called \\\"simultaneous\\\" occurrences\\n\\n\\n1\\n See North Georgia Finishing, Inc. v. Di-Chem, Inc., 419 U.S. 601, 615, 95 S.Ct. 719, 726, 42 L.Ed.2d 751 (1975) (Blackmun, J., dissenting)\\n\\n\\n2\\n Mr. Hudspeth was sentenced on November 26, 1991.  The court determined that the total offense level was 31;  the criminal history category was V;  the range of imprisonment was 180-210 months;  the range of supervised release was 3-5 years;  and the range of fine was $15,000 to $150,000.  It then sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of 180 months\\n\\n\\n3\\n In the unpublished order, this court also stated that it could not determine whether Mr. Hudspeth's adjudication of delinquency in 1975, a juvenile burglary conviction, was a \\\"violent felony\\\" that would count for the purposes of Sec. 924(e).  At the hearing on remand, the government acknowledged that it would offer no evidence with respect to that adjudication.  R.59 at 9-10.  The government further commented that there was \\\"no contest\\\" as to the second item listed in the information, the adult conviction for burglary in May 1979.  Id\\n\\n\\n4\\n The charge of burglary to which Mr. Hudspeth pled guilty is a class 2 felony in Illinois.  720 ILCS 5/19-1.  Because that state statute has been found to be broader than the generic definition of burglary found in Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2158, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), the sentencing court is required to review the charging paper and jury instructions to determine whether all the elements of generic burglary are present.  Id.; United States v. Howell, 37 F.3d 1197, 1206-07 (7th Cir.1994);  United States v. Simpson, 974 F.2d 845, 849 (7th Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1326, 122 L.Ed.2d 711 (1993).  Nothing in the record indicates that the district court examined those papers from state court.  However, the defendant did not raise this issue before the district court, nor does he raise it on appeal.  It is not critical to our decision for two reasons.  First, it may be that \\\"trial counsel obtained the charging papers, recognized that they satisfy Taylor, and saw no point in insisting that the record be padded with evidence adverse to his client.\\\"  United States v. Davenport, 986 F.2d 1047, 1050 (7th Cir.1993);  see also United States v. Davis, 16 F.3d 212, 215 n. 4 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 354, 130 L.Ed.2d 309 (1994) (No. 93-9130).  Second, the charging papers and certificates of judgment were presented in evidence to the district court at the resentencing proceeding, and they clearly fulfill the Taylor requirements\\n\\n\\n5\\n As the government noted at oral argument, the record simply does not reveal the precise sequence of the burglaries.  The police reports, Government's Exhibit 2, were submitted at the resentencing hearing on February 1, 1993.  Mr. Hudspeth maintains that he and his confederates entered through the doughnut shop.  He was apprehended in this space.  The government claims that the cleaners was the point of entry.  The reports of Officers Wubker, Pisarek and Avart, who were on the scene of the burglary, state that the rear door of the cleaning establishment had been pried open and that the door was ajar.  None of the officers observed their entry.  Officer M. Laughlin, the only one to see the three men in the alley, stated:\\nI observed two white males standing in a far northwest corner of Laketown Shopping Center.  Another white male came from the east, or front, parking area of Laketown and walked up to the other two white males in the northwest corner behind a garbage dumpster.  I watched the three suspects crouching, stand up and look around, and croutch [sic] again.  A few moments later, the three white males walked out of the shadow area and walked to the next rear door south and croutched [sic] again.  I checked the parking lot area for a moment, when I looked back, all three white males had disappeared.\\nThe report of Officer Rachford, who arrived at the shopping center after two of the three were in custody, stated:\\nActual entry into the building was through the back door to the doughnut shop.  The back door to the laundry was standing open, but it was opened from the inside because it cannot be opened from the outside.\\nThere are other discrepancies in the reports.  Officer Wubker reported that three officers kicked open the back door to the cleaners;  Officer Avart, however, stated that he \\\"started to ease the door open gently.  As the door started to open, the R/A then  felt a resistance as though someone was on the other side of the door ready to shut it.  The R/A then forced the door open, announced, 'halt police' and proceeded into the building followed by S/A Wubker and Officer Pisarek.\\\"   Also, several summaries stated that tools were lying on the floor of the cleaners, but Officer Pisarek \\\"observed several tools in the businesses.\\\"   Detective Rachford's statement specifically mentioned that \\\"[t]here was no evidence in the Insurance Agency or Doughnut Shop, but in the laundromat R/D recovered several pieces of evidence\\\" which he then listed.  Neither party presses before us these factual ambiguities and we do not have the benefit of a judicial finding by the district court with respect to the matter.\\n\\n\\n6\\n Mr. Hudspeth raised the double jeopardy issue in his sentencing memorandum, filed the day before the resentencing hearing.  The memorandum asserted that double jeopardy prohibited resentencing, but did not move explicitly to dismiss the case on that ground.  The district court proceeded to recalculate Mr. Hudspeth's sentence without adjudicating his double jeopardy claim.  Its decision to continue with the resentencing proceeding is impliedly a denial of the defendant's request for dismissal\\n\\n\\n7\\n At the resentencing hearing, the government did submit to the district court copies of the state charging papers and judgments of conviction.  There is no record whether the evidence was before the court at the first sentencing hearing\\n\\n\\n8\\n The Supreme Court granted certiorari in Bohlen v. Caspari, 979 F.2d 109 (8th Cir.1992), cert. granted, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2958, 125 L.Ed.2d 660 (1993), on the question whether the Double Jeopardy Clause, which prohibits the state from subjecting a defendant to successive capital sentencing proceedings, applies to successive noncapital sentence enhancement proceedings.  However, because the Court resolved the case on Teague grounds, it did not answer the double jeopardy issues.  Caspari v. Bohlen, --- U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 948, 957, 127 L.Ed.2d 236 (1994)\\nI note that, in Caspari, the state was required to prove the existence of the predicate offense beyond a reasonable doubt.  Therefore, arguably, the existence of the offense was an element of the state conviction.  In the case of the ACCA, the predicate conviction is not an element of the offense and the government is not required to prove its existence beyond a reasonable doubt.\\n\\n\\n9\\n \\\"No claim is made here that recidivist statutes are themselves unconstitutional, nor could there be under our cases....  Such statutes ... have been sustained in this Court on several occasions against contentions that they violate constitutional strictures dealing with double jeopardy.\\\"  Spencer, 385 U.S. at 559-60, 87 S.Ct. at 651\\n\\n\\n10\\n In Denton we held that the Indiana recidivist statute does not impose additional punishment for a past crime but rather imposes additional punishment for the later crime and therefore does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause\\n\\n\\n11\\n \\\"[W]hether punishments are in fact multiple and violative of the Double Jeopardy Clause involves first a task of ascertaining legislative intent.\\\"  Vigil, 818 F.2d at 741 (citing Ohio v. Johnson, 467 U.S. 493, 499, 104 S.Ct. 2536, 2540-41, 81 L.Ed.2d 425 (1984);  Missouri v. Hunter, 459 U.S. 359, 368-69, 103 S.Ct. 673, 679-80, 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983);  Whalen v. United States, 445 U.S. 684, 688-89, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1435-36, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980))\\n\\n\\n12\\n In Pleasant the Eleventh Circuit noted that the application of a recidivist statute is not additional punishment for an earlier crime, but a recognition that the repetition of criminal conduct aggravates the commission of the later crime and warrants imposition of the longer sentence\\n\\n\\n13\\n In Bowdach the Fifth Circuit reiterated that enhancement is not punishment for earlier crime but additional punishment for later crimes because it has been aggravated by the earlier crime\\n\\n\\n14\\n Under the Arkansas scheme, the state has the burden of proving the existence of the predicate conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.  Arguably, therefore, it is an element of the offense and its proof implicates, for that reason, the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Because the state did not question the applicability of the double jeopardy clause to its recidivist statute, the Court assumed that it was applicable.  See Nelson, 488 U.S. at 37-38 n. 6, 109 S.Ct. at 289 n. 6\\n\\n\\n15\\n In the present case, the government did not attempt at the resentencing to introduce any new material in aggravation, but merely \\\"unbundled\\\" the 1983 convictions previously before the court\\n\\n\\n16\\n Section 924(e)(1) of the ACCA establishes the requisites for a fifteen-year minimum sentence:\\nIn the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title and has three previous convictions by any court ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another, such person shall be fined not more than $25,000 and imprisoned not less than fifteen years[.]\\n\\n\\n17\\n Mandatory minimum sentences implement the ACCA's policy of \\\"selective incapacitation,\\\" the purpose of which is to \\\"select\\\" a particular class of offenders for \\\"incapacitation\\\" or long incarceration.  James E. Hooper, Note, Bright Lines, Dark Deeds:  Counting Convictions Under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 89 Mich.L.Rev.1951, 1953 (1991)\\nTo the extent that the criminal justice system identifies some criminals as unresponsive to rehabilitative treatment or deterrence, and expects them to offend again, the case for incapacitating them--denying them the opportunity to commit crimes by locking them up for long periods of time--is especially strong.  If the government cannot expect to change these criminals' behavior, it can at least isolate them and thereby protect society from their future crimes.\\nId. at 1953-54 (collecting articles concerning selective incapacitation policy).\\n\\n\\n18\\n See United States v.

UNITED STATES\\n\\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\\n                 THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\\n\\n    No. 11–9335. Argued January 14, 2013—Decided June 17, 2013\\nPetitioner Alleyne was charged, as relevant here, with using or carry-\\n  ing a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, 18 U. S. C.\\n  §924(c)(1)(A), which carries a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence,\\n  §924(c)(1)(A)(i), that increases to a 7-year minimum “if the firearm is\\n  brandished,” §924(c)(1)(A)(ii), and to a 10-year minimum “if the fire-\\n  arm is discharged,” §924(c)(1)(A)(iii). In convicting Alleyne, the jury\\n  form indicated that he had “[u]sed or carried a firearm during and in\\n  relation to a crime of violence,” but not that the firearm was\\n  “[b]randished.” When the presentence report recommended a 7-year\\n  sentence on the §924(c) count, Alleyne objected, arguing that the ver-\\n  dict form clearly indicated that the jury did not find brandishing be-\\n  yond a reasonable doubt and that raising his mandatory minimum\\n  sentence based on a sentencing judge’s finding of brandishing would\\n  violate his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. The District Court\\n  overruled his objection, relying on this Court’s holding in Harris v.\\n  United States, 536 U. S. 545, that judicial factfinding that increases\\n  the mandatory minimum sentence for a crime is permissible under\\n  the Sixth Amendment. The Fourth Circuit affirmed, agreeing that\\n  Alleyne’s objection was foreclosed by Harris.\\nHeld: The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded. Pp. 10–17.\\n457 Fed. Appx. 348, vacated and remanded.\\n    JUSTICE THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to\\n  Parts I, III–B, III–C, and IV, concluding:\\n    1. Because mandatory minimum sentences increase the penalty for\\n  a crime, any fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an “ele-\\n  ment” that must be submitted to the jury. Accordingly, Harris is\\n  overruled. Pp. 10–16.\\n\\x0c2                      ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                                   Syllabus\\n\\n           (a) Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, concluded that any\\n    “ ‘facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a\\n    criminal defendant is exposed’ ” are elements of the crime, id., at 490,\\n    and thus the Sixth Amendment provides defendants with the right to\\n    have a jury find those facts beyond a reasonable doubt, id., at 484.\\n    Apprendi’s principle applies with equal force to facts increasing the\\n    mandatory minimum, for a fact triggering a mandatory minimum al-\\n    ters the prescribed range of sentences to which a criminal defendant\\n    is exposed. Id., at 490. Because the legally prescribed range is the\\n    penalty affixed to the crime, it follows that a fact increasing either\\n    end of the range produces a new penalty and constitutes an ingredi-\\n    ent of the offense. It is impossible to dissociate the floor of a sentenc-\\n    ing range from the penalty affixed to the crime. The fact that crimi-\\n    nal statutes have long specified both the floor and ceiling of sentence\\n    ranges is evidence that both define the legally prescribed penalty. It\\n    is also impossible to dispute that the facts increasing the legally pre-\\n    scribed floor aggravate the punishment, heightening the loss of liber-\\n    ty associated with the crime. Defining facts that increase a mandato-\\n    ry minimum to be part of the substantive offense enables the\\n    defendant to predict the legally applicable penalty from the face of\\n    the indictment, see id., at 478–479, and preserves the jury’s historic\\n    role as an intermediary between the State and criminal defendants,\\n    see United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 510–511. In reaching a\\n    contrary conclusion, Harris relied on the fact that the 7-year mini-\\n    mum sentence could have been imposed with or without a judicial\\n    finding of brandishing, because the jury’s finding authorized a sen-\\n    tence of five years to life, 536 U. S., at 561, but that fact is beside the\\n    point. The essential Sixth Amendment inquiry is whether a fact is\\n    an element of the crime. Because the fact of brandishing aggravates\\n    the legally prescribed range of allowable sentences, it constitutes an\\n    element of a separate, aggravated offense that must be found by the\\n    jury, regardless of what sentence the defendant might have received\\n    had a different range been applicable. There is no basis in principle\\n    or logic to distinguish facts that raise the maximum from those that\\n    increase the minimum. Pp. 10–15.\\n           (b) This ruling does not mean that any fact that influences judi-\\n    cial discretion must be found by a jury. This Court has long recog-\\n    nized that broad sentencing discretion, informed by judicial factfind-\\n    ing, does not violate the Sixth Amendment. See, e.g., Dillon v. United\\n    States, 560 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 15–16.\\n        2. Here, the sentencing range supported by the jury’s verdict was\\n    five years’ imprisonment to life, but the judge, rather than the jury,\\n    found brandishing. This increased the penalty to which Alleyne was\\n    subjected and violated his Sixth Amendment rights. Pp. 16–17.\\n\\x0c                   Cite as: 570 U.

The Sixth Amendment right to trial “by an impartial jury,” in\\nconjunction with the Due Process Clause, requires that each element\\nof a crime be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Gaudin,\\n515 U. S., at 510. Several divided opinions of this Court have ad-\\ndressed the constitutional status of a “sentencing factor.” In McMil-\\nlan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 86, the Court held that facts found\\nto increase a mandatory minimum sentence are sentencing factors\\nthat a judge could find by a preponderance of the evidence. In Ap-\\nprendi, however, the Court declined to extend McMillan to a New\\nJersey statute that increased the maximum term of imprisonment if\\nthe trial judge found that the crime was committed with racial bias,\\n530 U. S., at 470, finding that any fact that increased the prescribed\\nstatutory maximum sentence must be an “element” of the offense to\\nbe found by the jury. Id., at 483, n. 10, 490. Two years later in Har-\\nris, the Court declined to apply Apprendi to facts that increased the\\nmandatory minimum sentence but not the maximum sentence. 536\\nU. S., at 557. Pp. 3–6.\\n   2. The touchstone for determining whether a fact must be found by\\na jury beyond a reasonable doubt is whether the fact constitutes an\\n“element” of the charged offense. United States v. O’Brien, 560 U. S.\\n218, ___. Apprendi’s definition necessarily includes not only facts\\nthat increase the ceiling, but also those that increase the floor. At\\ncommon law, the relationship between crime and punishment was\\nclear. A sentence was prescribed for each offense, leaving judges\\nwith little sentencing discretion. If a fact was by law essential to the\\npenalty, it was an element of the offense. There was a well-\\nestablished practice of including in the indictment, and submitting to\\nthe jury, every fact that was a basis for imposing or increasing pun-\\nishment. And this understanding was reflected in contemporaneous\\ncourt decisions and treatises. Pp. 6–10.\\n   JUSTICE BREYER, agreeing that Harris v. United States, 536 U. S.\\n545, should be overruled, concluded that he continues to disagree\\nwith Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, because it fails to recog-\\nnize the law’s traditional distinction between elements of a crime and\\nsentencing facts, but finds it highly anomalous to read Apprendi as\\ninsisting that juries find sentencing facts that permit a judge to im-\\npose a higher sentence while not insisting that juries find sentencing\\nfacts that require a judge to impose a higher sentence. Overruling\\nHarris and applying Apprendi’s basic jury-determination rule to\\nmandatory minimum sentences would erase that anomaly. Where a\\nmaximum sentence is at issue, Apprendi means that a judge who\\nwishes to impose a higher sentence cannot do so unless a jury finds\\n\\x0c4                    ALLEYNE v.

United States, 536 U. S. 545 (2002), this\\nCourt held that judicial factfinding that increases the\\nmandatory minimum sentence for a crime is permissible\\nunder the Sixth Amendment. We granted certiorari to\\nconsider whether that decision should be overruled. 568\\nU. S. ___ (2012).\\n  Harris drew a distinction between facts that increase\\nthe statutory maximum and facts that increase only the\\nmandatory minimum. We conclude that this distinction is\\ninconsistent with our decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey,\\n530 U. S. 466 (2000), and with the original meaning of the\\nSixth Amendment. Any fact that, by law, increases the\\npenalty for a crime is an “element” that must be submitted\\nto the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt. See id.,\\nat 483, n. 10, 490. Mandatory minimum sentences in-\\ncrease the penalty for a crime. It follows, then, that any\\n\\x0c2               ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\\n                    Opinion of the Court\\n\\nfact that increases the mandatory minimum is an “ele-\\nment” that must be submitted to the jury. Accordingly,\\nHarris is overruled.\\n                               I\\n   Petitioner Allen Ryan Alleyne and an accomplice de-\\nvised a plan to rob a store manager as he drove the store’s\\ndaily deposits to a local bank. By feigning car trouble,\\nthey tricked the manager to stop. Alleyne’s accomplice\\napproached the manager with a gun and demanded the\\nstore’s deposits, which the manager surrendered. Alleyne\\nwas later charged with multiple federal offenses, includ-\\ning robbery affecting interstate commerce, 18 U. S. C.\\n§1951(a), and using or carrying a firearm in relation to a\\ncrime of violence, §924(c)(1)(A). Section 924(c)(1)(A) pro-\\nvides, in relevant part, that anyone who “uses or carries a\\nfirearm” in relation to a “crime of violence” shall:\\n      “(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not\\n    less than 5 years;\\n      “(ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a\\n    term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years; and\\n      “(iii) if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to a\\n    term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years.”\\nThe jury convicted Alleyne. The jury indicated on the\\nverdict form that Alleyne had “[u]sed or carried a firearm\\nduring and in relation to a crime of violence,” but did not\\nindicate a finding that the firearm was “[b]randished.”\\nApp. 40.\\n  The presentence report recommended a 7-year sentence\\non the §924(c) count, which reflected the mandatory min-\\nimum sentence for cases in which a firearm has been\\n“brandished,” §924(c)(1)(A)(ii). Alleyne objected to this\\nrecommendation. He argued that it was clear from the\\nverdict form that the jury did not find brandishing beyond\\na reasonable doubt and that he was subject only to the\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 570 U.

It\\nexplained that, under Harris, brandishing was a sentenc-\\ning factor that the court could find by a preponderance of\\nevidence without running afoul of the Constitution. It\\nfound that the evidence supported a finding of brandish-\\ning, and sentenced Alleyne to seven years’ imprisonment\\non the §924(c) count. The Court of Appeals affirmed,\\nlikewise noting that Alleyne’s objection was foreclosed by\\nHarris. 457 Fed. Appx. 348 (CA4 2011) (per curiam).\\n                             II\\n  The Sixth Amendment provides that those “accused” of\\na “crime” have the right to a trial “by an impartial jury.”\\nThis right, in conjunction with the Due Process Clause,\\nrequires that each element of a crime be proved to the jury\\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. United States v. Gaudin, 515\\nU. S. 506, 510 (1995); In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364\\n(1970). The substance and scope of this right depend upon\\nthe proper designation of the facts that are elements of the\\ncrime.\\n                             A\\n  The question of how to define a “crime”—and, thus, how\\nto determine what facts must be submitted to the jury—\\nhas generated a number of divided opinions from this\\nCourt. The principal source of disagreement is the consti-\\ntutional status of a special sort of fact known as a “sen-\\ntencing factor.” This term was first used in McMillan v.\\nPennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 86 (1986), to refer to facts that\\nare not found by a jury but that can still increase the\\ndefendant’s punishment. Following McMillan’s introduc-\\n\\x0c4               ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\\n\\ntion of this term, this Court has made a number of efforts\\nto delimit its boundaries.\\n    McMillan initially invoked the distinction between\\n“elements” and “sentencing factors” to reject a constitu-\\ntional challenge to Pennsylvania’s Mandatory Minimum\\nSentencing Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. §9712 (1982). That law\\nprovided that anyone convicted of certain felonies would\\nbe subject to a mandatory minimum sentence if the judge\\nfound, by a preponderance of evidence, that the person\\n“ ‘visibly possessed a firearm’ ” in the course of committing\\nspecified crimes. 477 U. S., at 81, n. 1. While the Court\\nacknowledged that there were constitutional limits to the\\nState’s ability to “defin[e] crimes and prescrib[e] penal-\\nties,” it found that the Commonwealth had permissi-\\nbly defined visible possession as a sentencing factor,\\nrather than an element. Id., at 86. In the Court’s view,\\nthis allowed the judge, rather than the jury, to find this\\nfact by a preponderance of evidence without violating the\\nConstitution.\\n    McMillan did not address whether legislatures’ freedom\\nto define facts as sentencing factors extended to findings\\nthat increased the maximum term of imprisonment for an\\noffense. We foreshadowed an answer to this question in\\nJones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 243, n. 6 (1999), but\\ndid not resolve the issue until Apprendi. There, we identi-\\nfied a concrete limit on the types of facts that legislatures\\nmay designate as sentencing factors.\\n    In Apprendi, the defendant was sentenced to 12 years’\\nimprisonment under a New Jersey statute that increased\\nthe maximum term of imprisonment from 10 years to 20\\nyears if the trial judge found that the defendant commit-\\nted his crime with racial bias. 530 U. S., at 470. In de-\\nfending its sentencing scheme, the State of New Jersey\\nargued that, under McMillan, the legislature could define\\nracial bias as a sentencing factor to be found by the judge.\\nWe declined to extend McMillan that far. We explained\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            5\\n\\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\\n\\nthat there was no “principled basis for treating” a fact\\nincreasing the maximum term of imprisonment differently\\nthan the facts constituting the base offense. 530 U. S., at\\n476. The historic link between crime and punishment,\\ninstead, led us to conclude that any fact that increased the\\nprescribed statutory maximum sentence must be an “ele-\\nment” of the offense to be found by the jury. Id., at 483,\\nn. 10, 490. We, thus, found that Apprendi’s sentence\\nhad been unconstitutionally enhanced by the judge’s finding\\nof racial bias by a preponderance of evidence. Id., at\\n491–492.\\n                              B\\n  While Apprendi only concerned a judicial finding that\\nincreased the statutory maximum, the logic of Apprendi\\nprompted questions about the continuing vitality, if not\\nvalidity, of McMillan’s holding that facts found to increase\\nthe mandatory minimum sentence are sentencing factors\\nand not elements of the crime. We responded two years\\nlater in Harris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545, where we\\nconsidered the same statutory provision and the same\\nquestion before us today.\\n  In Harris, the defendant was charged, under §924(c)\\n(1)(A), with carrying a firearm in the course of committing\\na drug trafficking crime. The mandatory minimum sen-\\ntence based on the jury’s verdict alone was five years, but\\nthe District Court imposed a 7-year mandatory minimum\\nsentence based on its finding, by a preponderance of evi-\\ndence, that the defendant also brandished the firearm. As\\nin this case, Harris challenged his sentence on the ground\\nthat the 7-year mandatory minimum sentence was uncon-\\nstitutional under Apprendi, even though the judge’s find-\\ning did not alter the maximum sentence to which he was\\nexposed. Harris, supra, at 551.\\n  The Court declined to apply Apprendi to facts that\\nincreased the mandatory minimum sentence but not the\\n\\x0c6                ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\\n\\nmaximum sentence. 536 U. S., at 557. In the Court’s\\nview, judicial factfinding that increased the mandatory\\nminimum did not implicate the Sixth Amendment. Be-\\ncause the jury’s verdict “authorized the judge to impose\\nthe minimum with or without the finding,” ibid., the Court\\nwas of the view that the factual basis for increasing the\\nminimum sentence was not “ ‘essential’ ” to the defendant’s\\npunishment. Id., at 560–561 (plurality opinion). Instead,\\nit merely limited the judge’s “choices within the author-\\nized range.” Id., at 567. From this, the Court drew a\\ndistinction between “facts increasing the defendant’s\\nminimum sentence and facts extending the sentence be-\\nyond the statutory maximum,” id., at 566. The Court\\nlimited Apprendi’s holding to instances where the factual\\nfinding increases the statutory maximum sentence.\\n                          III\\n  Alleyne contends that Harris was wrongly decided\\nand that it cannot be reconciled with our reasoning in\\nApprendi. We agree.\\n                              A\\n   The touchstone for determining whether a fact must be\\nfound by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt is whether the\\nfact constitutes an “element” or “ingredient” of the charged\\noffense. United States v. O’Brien, 560 U. S. 218, ___ (2010)\\n(slip op., at 5); Apprendi, supra, at 483, n. 10; J. Archbold,\\nPleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases 52 (5th Am. ed.\\n1846) (hereinafter Archbold). In Apprendi, we held that a\\nfact is by definition an element of the offense and must be\\nsubmitted to the jury if it increases the punishment above\\nwhat is otherwise legally prescribed. 530 U. S., at 483,\\nn. 10. While Harris declined to extend this principle to\\nfacts increasing mandatory minimum sentences, Appren-\\ndi’s definition of “elements” necessarily includes not only\\nfacts that increase the ceiling, but also those that increase\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 570 U.

Both kinds of facts alter the prescribed range of\\nsentences to which a defendant is exposed and do so in a\\nmanner that aggravates the punishment. 530 U. S., at\\n483, n. 10; Harris, supra, at 579 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\\nFacts that increase the mandatory minimum sentence are\\ntherefore elements and must be submitted to the jury and\\nfound beyond a reasonable doubt.\\n                              1\\n   At common law, the relationship between crime and\\npunishment was clear. As discussed in Apprendi, “[t]he\\nsubstantive criminal law tended to be sanction-specific,”\\nmeaning “it prescribed a particular sentence for each\\noffense.” Langbein, The English Criminal Trial Jury on\\nthe Eve of the French Revolution, in The Trial Jury in\\nEngland, France, Germany 1700–1900, p. 36 (A. Schioppa\\ned. 1987) (quoted in Apprendi, supra, at 479). The system\\nleft judges with little sentencing discretion: once the facts\\nof the offense were determined by the jury, the “judge was\\nmeant simply to impose [the prescribed] sentence.” Lang-\\nbein, supra, at 36–37; see also 3 W. Blackstone, Commen-\\ntaries on the Laws of England 396 (1768) (“THE judgment,\\nthough pronounced or awarded by the judges, is not their\\ndetermination or sentence, but the determination and\\nsentence of the law” (emphasis deleted)). This Court has\\nrecognized that the same was true, in many instances,\\nearly on in this country. United States v. Grayson, 438\\nU. S. 41, 45 (1978); see, e.g., Commonwealth v. Smith, 1\\nMass. 245 (1804) (describing state law that specified a\\npunishment for larceny of damages three times the value\\nof the stolen goods). While some early American statutes\\nprovided ranges of permissible sentences, K. Stith & J.\\nCabranes, Fear of Judging: Sentencing Guidelines in the\\nFederal Courts 9 (1998), the ranges themselves were\\nlinked to particular facts constituting the elements of the\\ncrime. E.g., Lacy v. State, 15 Wis. 13 (1862) (discussing\\n\\x0c8               ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\\n\\narson statute that provided for a sentence of 7 to 14 years\\nwhere the house was occupied at the time of the offense,\\nbut a sentence of 3 to 10 if it was not); Ga. Penal Code\\n§§4324–4325 (1867) (robbery “by open force or violence”\\nwas punishable by 4 to 20 years’ imprisonment, while\\n“[r]obbery by intimidation, or without using force and\\nviolence,” was punishable by 2 to 5 years’ imprisonment).\\nThis linkage of facts with particular sentence ranges\\n(defined by both the minimum and the maximum) reflects\\nthe intimate connection between crime and punishment.\\n   Consistent with this connection between crime and\\npunishment, various treatises defined “crime” as consist-\\ning of every fact which “is in law essential to the punish-\\nment sought to be inflicted,” 1 J. Bishop, Criminal Proce-\\ndure 50 (2d ed. 1872) (hereinafter Bishop), or the whole of\\nthe wrong “to which the law affixes . . . punishment,” id.,\\n§80, at 51. See also 1 J. Bishop, New Criminal Procedure\\n§84, p. 49 (4th ed. 1895) (defining crime as “that wrongful\\naggregation [of elements] out of which the punishment\\nproceeds”); Archbold 128 (defining crime to include any\\nfact that “annexes a higher degree of punishment”). Nu-\\nmerous high courts agreed that this formulation “accu-\\nrately captured the common-law understanding of what\\nfacts are elements of a crime.” Apprendi, 530 U. S., at\\n511–512 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (collecting cases). If a\\nfact was by law essential to the penalty, it was an element\\nof the offense.\\n                             2\\n  From these widely recognized principles followed a well-\\nestablished practice of including in the indictment, and\\nsubmitting to the jury, every fact that was a basis for\\nimposing or increasing punishment. While an exhaustive\\nhistory need not be recounted here, see id., at 501–509\\n(THOMAS, J., concurring) (detailing practices of American\\ncourts from the 1840’s onward), a few particularly salient\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)             9\\n\\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\\n\\nexamples illustrate the point. In Hope v. Commonwealth,\\n50 Mass. 134 (1845), the defendant was indicted for (and\\nconvicted of) larceny. The larceny statute established two\\nlevels of sentencing based on whether the value of the\\nstolen property exceeded $100. Because punishment\\nvaried with value, the state high court found that value\\nwas an element of the offense:\\n    “Our statutes, it will be remembered, prescribe the\\n    punishment for larceny, with reference to the value of\\n    the property stolen; and for this reason, as well as be-\\n    cause it is in conformity with long established prac-\\n    tice, the court are of [the] opinion that the value of the\\n    property alleged to be stolen must be set forth in the\\n    indictment.” Id., at 137.\\nNumerous other contemporaneous court decisions reflect\\nthis same understanding. See, e.g., Ritchey v. State, 7\\nBlackf. 168, 169 (Ind. 1844) (holding that indictment for\\narson must allege value of property destroyed, because\\nstatute set punishment based on value); United States v.\\nFisher, 25 F. Cas. 1086 (No. 15,102) (CC Ohio 1849)\\n(McLean, J.) (“A carrier of the mail is subject to a higher\\npenalty where he steals a letter out of the mail, which\\ncontains an article of value. And when this offense is\\ncommitted, the indictment must allege the letter con-\\ntained an article of value, which aggravates the offense\\nand incurs a higher penalty”).\\n  A number of contemporaneous treatises similarly took\\nthe view that a fact that increased punishment must be\\ncharged in the indictment. As one 19th-century commen-\\ntator explained:\\n    “Where a statute annexes a higher degree of punish-\\n    ment to a common-law felony, if committed under\\n    particular circumstances, an indictment for the offence,\\n    in order to bring the defendant within that higher de-\\n    gree of punishment, must expressly charge it to have\\n\\x0c10                  ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                         Opinion of THOMAS, J.\\n                         Opinion of the Court\\n\\n     been committed under those circumstances, and must\\n     state the circumstances with certainty and precision.\\n     [2 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown *170].” Archbold 51\\n     (15th ed. 1862).\\nAnother explained that “the indictment must contain an\\nallegation of every fact which is legally essential to the\\npunishment to be inflicted.” Bishop §81, at 51.

But for a finding of brandishing, the penalty is five\\nyears to life in prison; with a finding of brandishing, the\\npenalty becomes seven years to life. Just as the maximum\\nof life marks the outer boundary of the range, so seven\\nyears marks its floor. And because the legally prescribed\\nrange is the penalty affixed to the crime, infra, this page,\\nit follows that a fact increasing either end of the range\\nproduces a new penalty and constitutes an ingredient of\\nthe offense. Apprendi, supra, at 501 (THOMAS, J., concur-\\nring); see also Bishop §598, at 360–361 (if “a statute pre-\\nscribes a particular punishment to be inflicted on those\\nwho commit it under special circumstances which it men-\\ntions, or with particular aggravations,” then those special\\ncircumstances must be specified in the indictment (em-\\nphasis added)); 1 F.

Indeed, criminal statutes have long speci-\\nfied both the floor and ceiling of sentence ranges, which is\\nevidence that both define the legally prescribed penalty.\\nSee, e.g., supra, at 7–8; N. Y. Penal Code §§231–232, p. 70\\n(1882) (punishment for first-degree robbery was 10 to 20\\nyears’ imprisonment; second-degree robbery was 5 to 15\\nyears); Va.

A fact that increases a sen-\\ntencing floor, thus, forms an essential ingredient of the\\noffense.\\n   Moreover, it is impossible to dispute that facts increas-\\ning the legally prescribed floor aggravate the punishment.\\nHarris, supra, at 579 (THOMAS, J., dissenting); O’Brien,\\n560 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment)\\n(slip op., at 2). Elevating the low-end of a sentenc-\\ning range heightens the loss of liberty associated with\\nthe crime: the defendant’s “expected punishment has\\nincreased as a result of the narrowed range” and “the prose-\\ncution is empowered, by invoking the mandatory mini-\\nmum, to require the judge to impose a higher punishment\\nthan he might wish.” Apprendi, supra, at 522 (THOMAS,\\nJ., concurring). Why else would Congress link an in-\\ncreased mandatory minimum to a particular aggravating\\nfact other than to heighten the consequences for that\\nbehavior? See McMillan, 477 U. S., at 88, 89 (twice noting\\nthat a mandatory minimum “ ‘ups the ante’ ” for a criminal\\ndefendant); Harris, supra, at 580 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\\nThis reality demonstrates that the core crime and the fact\\ntriggering the mandatory minimum sentence together\\nconstitute a new, aggravated crime, each element of which\\nmust be submitted to the jury.2\\n——————\\n   2 Juries must find any facts that increase either the statutory maxi-\\n\\nmum or minimum because the Sixth Amendment applies where a\\nfinding of fact both alters the legally prescribed range and does so in a\\nway that aggravates the penalty. Importantly, this is distinct from\\nfactfinding used to guide judicial discretion in selecting a punishment\\n“within limits fixed by law.” Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241, 246\\n(1949). While such findings of fact may lead judges to select sentences\\nthat are more severe than the ones they would have selected without\\nthose facts, the Sixth Amendment does not govern that element of\\nsentencing.

See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at\\n478–479. It also preserves the historic role of the jury as\\nan intermediary between the State and criminal defend-\\nants. See United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S., at 510–511\\n(“This right was designed ‘to guard against a spirit of\\noppression and tyranny on the part of rulers,’ and ‘was\\nfrom very early times insisted on by our ancestors in the\\nparent country, as the great bulwark of their civil and\\npolitical liberties’ ” (quoting 2 J.

S., at 561. The dissent repeats\\nthis argument today. See post, at 5 (opinion of ROBERTS,\\nC. J.) (“The jury’s verdict authorized the judge to impose\\nthe precise sentence he imposed for the precise factual\\nreason he imposed it”). While undoubtedly true, this fact\\nis beside the point.3\\n——————\\n   3 Apprendi rejected an argument similar to the one advanced in Har-\\n\\nris. In Apprendi, the State of New Jersey argued that increasing the\\ndefendant’s statutory maximum on the challenged count did not violate\\nthe Sixth Amendment because “the judge could have imposed consecu-\\ntive sentences,” in conjunction with other counts, to produce the sen-\\ntence that the defendant actually received on the count at issue. 530\\nU. S., at 474. We found that this possibility did not preclude a Sixth\\n\\x0c14                 ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                       Opinion of THOMAS, J.\\n                       Opinion of the Court\\n\\n  As noted, the essential Sixth Amendment inquiry is\\nwhether a fact is an element of the crime. When a finding\\nof fact alters the legally prescribed punishment so as to\\naggravate it, the fact necessarily forms a constituent part\\nof a new offense and must be submitted to the jury. It is\\nno answer to say that the defendant could have received\\nthe same sentence with or without that fact. It is obvious,\\nfor example, that a defendant could not be convicted and\\nsentenced for assault, if the jury only finds the facts for\\nlarceny, even if the punishments prescribed for each crime\\nare identical. One reason is that each crime has different\\nelements and a defendant can be convicted only if the jury\\nhas found each element of the crime of conviction.\\n  Similarly, because the fact of brandishing aggravates\\nthe legally prescribed range of allowable sentences, it\\nconstitutes an element of a separate, aggravated offense\\nthat must be found by the jury, regardless of what sen-\\ntence the defendant might have received if a different\\nrange had been applicable. Indeed, if a judge were to find\\na fact that increased the statutory maximum sentence,\\nsuch a finding would violate the Sixth Amendment, even if\\nthe defendant ultimately received a sentence falling within\\nthe original sentencing range (i.e., the range applicable\\nwithout that aggravating fact). Cf. Hobbs v. State, 44 Tex.\\n353 (1875) (reversing conviction where the defendant was\\nindicted for a crime punishable by 2 to 5 years and sen-\\ntenced to 3 years because the trial court improperly in-\\nstructed the jury to sentence the defendant between 2 to\\n10 years if it found a particular aggravating fact); State v.\\nCallahan, 109 La. 946, 33 So. 931 (1903) (finding ex post\\nfacto violation where a newly enacted law increased the\\nrange of punishment, even though defendant was sen-\\ntenced within the range established by the prior law).4\\n——————\\nAmendment violation.

Our ruling today\\ndoes not mean that any fact that influences judicial discre-\\ntion must be found by a jury. We have long recognized\\nthat broad sentencing discretion, informed by judicial\\nfactfinding, does not violate the Sixth Amendment. See,\\ne.g., Dillon v. United States, 560 U.

The elements of\\naggravated intimidation include all the elements of intimidation plus\\none enumerated aggravating fact. Under this statute, if a jury found\\neach element of intimidation, but the judge purported to find a fact that\\nelevated the offense to aggravated intimidation, the Sixth Amendment\\nwould most certainly be violated, even if the defendant received a\\nsentence that fell within both ranges.

United States, 536 U. S. 545 (2002),\\nand McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986), were\\nwrongly decided. Under the reasoning of our decision in\\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), and the\\noriginal meaning of the Sixth Amendment, facts that\\nincrease the statutory minimum sentence (no less than\\nfacts that increase the statutory maximum sentence) are\\nelements of the offense that must be found by a jury and\\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt. Ante, at 1.\\n   Of course, under our doctrine of stare decisis, establish-\\ning that a decision was wrong does not, without more,\\njustify overruling it. While stare decisis is not an “inexo-\\nrable command,” Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236, 251\\n(1998) (internal quotation marks omitted), it is “a basic\\nself-governing principle within the Judicial Branch, which\\nis entrusted with the sensitive and difficult task of fash-\\nioning and preserving a jurisprudential system that is not\\nbased upon ‘an arbitrary discretion,’ ” Patterson v. McLean\\nCredit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172 (1989) (quoting The\\nFederalist, No. 78, p. 490 (H. Lodge ed. 1888) (A. Hamil-\\nton)). We generally adhere to our prior decisions, even if\\nwe question their soundness, because doing so “promotes\\n\\x0c2                ALLEYNE v.

Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827\\n(1991). To protect these important values, we require a\\n“ ‘ “special justification” ’ ” when departing from precedent.\\nDickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 443 (2000).\\n    A special justification is present here. As an initial\\nmatter, when procedural rules are at issue that do not\\ngovern primary conduct and do not implicate the reliance\\ninterests of private parties, the force of stare decisis is\\nreduced. See United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 521\\n(1995); Payne, 501 U. S., at 828. And any reliance interest\\nthat the Federal Government and state governments\\nmight have is particularly minimal here because prosecu-\\ntors are perfectly able to “charge facts upon which a man-\\ndatory minimum sentence is based in the indictment and\\nprove them to a jury.” Harris, 536 U. S., at 581 (THOMAS,\\nJ., dissenting). Indeed, even with Harris in place, prose-\\ncutors already sometimes charge such facts and seek to\\nprove them to a jury. See Brief for National Association of\\nCriminal Defense Lawyers et al. as Amici Curiae 26. That\\nis precisely what happened here, where the verdict form\\nallowed the jury to find whether petitioner had brandished\\na firearm yet the jury declined to make such a finding.\\nAnte, at 2.\\n    In this context, stare decisis does not compel adherence\\nto a decision whose “underpinnings” have been “eroded” by\\nsubsequent developments of constitutional law. Gaudin,\\n515 U. S., at 521. In rejecting a constitutional challenge to\\na state statute that increased a defendant’s minimum\\nsentence based on judicial factfinding, McMillan relied on\\na distinction between “elements” and “sentencing factors.”\\n477 U.

That distinction was undermined by\\nApprendi, where we held that a legislature may not “re-\\nmove from the jury the assessment of facts that increase\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 570 U.

Five\\nMembers of the Court recognized that the cases were in\\nfact incompatible. See id., at 569 (BREYER, J., concurring\\nin part and concurring in judgment); id., at 572, 583\\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (“[O]nly a minority of the Court\\nembrac[es] the distinction between McMillan and Apprendi\\nthat forms the basis of today’s holding”). In the control-\\nling opinion, JUSTICE BREYER nevertheless declined to\\napply Apprendi to mandatory minimums because, though\\nhe found no way to distinguish sentencing floors from\\nsentencing ceilings, he could not “yet accept” Apprendi\\nitself. 536 U. S., at 569; see also post, at 1 (BREYER, J.,\\nconcurring in part and concurring in judgment).\\n   We have said that a decision may be “of questionable\\nprecedential value” when “a majority of the Court expressly\\ndisagreed with the rationale of [a] plurality.” Seminole\\nTribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 66 (1996). And\\nHarris has stood on especially weak ground because its\\nvitality depended upon the possibility that the Court\\nmight retreat from Apprendi. See Harris, 536 U. S., at\\n569–570 (opinion of BREYER, J.). That has not happened.\\nInstead, while individual Members of this Court have\\ncontinued to question Apprendi, see post, at 1–2 (opinion\\nof BREYER, J.); post, at 1–2 (ALITO, J., dissenting), its rule\\nhas become even more firmly rooted in the Court’s Sixth\\nAmendment jurisprudence in the decade since Harris. We\\nhave applied Apprendi to strike down mandatory sentenc-\\ning systems at the state and federal levels. See Cunning-\\nham v. California, 549 U. S. 270 (2007); United States v.\\nBooker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005); Blakely v. Washington, 542\\nU. S. 296 (2004). And just last Term, we recognized that\\nApprendi’s reasoning extends to criminal fines. See\\n\\x0c4                ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring\\n\\nSouthern Union Co. v. United States, 567 U. S. ___ (2012).\\n  As a result of these decisions, Harris has become even\\nmore of an outlier. For that reason, I agree that it is\\nappropriate for the Court to “overrule Harris and to apply\\nApprendi’s basic jury-determination rule to mandatory\\nminimum sentences” in order to “erase th[is] anomaly” in\\nour case law. Post, at 2–3 (opinion of BREYER, J.). I do not\\nsuggest that every single factor that supports the overrul-\\ning of precedent is present here. Post, at 3, n. * (ALITO, J.,\\ndissenting). But particularly in a case where the reliance\\ninterests are so minimal, and the reliance interests of\\nprivate parties are nonexistent, stare decisis cannot excuse\\na refusal to bring “coherence and consistency,” Patterson,\\n491 U. S., at 174, to our Sixth Amendment law.\\n  If any doubt remained, our decision in Ring v. Arizona,\\n536 U. S. 584 (2002), should remove it. Ring considered\\nan Apprendi challenge to Arizona’s capital sentencing\\nsystem. There, as here, the government urged us to ad-\\nhere to a pre-Apprendi decision upholding that scheme.\\nSee Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990). And there, as\\nhere, we resisted that plea. Ring, 536 U. S., at 609. This\\ncase differs in only one respect: Our post-Apprendi consid-\\neration of the issue in Harris. But for the reasons given,\\nHarris in no way strengthens the force of stare decisis in\\nthis case. With Apprendi now firmly rooted in our juris-\\nprudence, the Court simply gives effect to what five Mem-\\nbers of the Court recognized in Harris: “[McMillan] and\\nApprendi are irreconcilable; our Sixth Amendment juris-\\nprudence cannot be home to both.” 536 U. S., at 609.\\n  JUSTICE ALITO is therefore mistaken when he suggests\\nthat the Court overrules Harris because “there are cur-\\nrently five Justices willing to vote to” do so. Post, at 3, n.\\n*.

United States, 536 U. S.\\n545 (2002), I wrote that “I cannot easily distinguish Ap-\\nprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), from this case\\nin terms of logic.” Id., at 569 (opinion concurring in part\\nand concurring in judgment). I nonetheless accepted\\nHarris’ holding because I could “[n]ot yet accept [Ap-\\nprendi’s] rule.” 536 U. S., at 569. I continue to disagree\\nwith Apprendi. See 536 U. S., at 569–570; United States v.\\nBooker, 543 U. S. 220, 326 (2005) (opinion dissenting in\\npart); Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296, 328 (2004)\\n(dissenting opinion); Apprendi, supra, at 555 (same). But\\nApprendi has now defined the relevant legal regime for an\\nadditional decade. And, in my view, the law should no\\nlonger tolerate the anomaly that the Apprendi/Harris\\ndistinction creates.\\n   The Court’s basic error in Apprendi, I believe, was its\\nfailure to recognize the law’s traditional distinction be-\\ntween elements of a crime (facts constituting the crime,\\ntypically for the jury to determine) and sentencing facts\\n(facts affecting the sentence, often concerning, e.g., the\\nmanner in which the offender committed the crime, and\\ntypically for the judge to determine). The early historical\\nreferences that this Court’s opinions have set forth in\\n\\x0c2               ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\\n\\nfavor of Apprendi refer to offense elements, not to sentenc-\\ning facts. Thus, when Justice Story wrote that the Sixth\\nAmendment’s guarantee of trial by jury offered “ ‘securit[y]\\nagainst the prejudices of judges,’ ” post, at 4 (ROBERTS,\\nC. J., dissenting) (quoting Commentaries on the Consti-\\ntution of the United States §924, p. 657 (Abr. 1833)), he\\nwas likely referring to elements of a crime; and the best\\nanswer to JUSTICE SCALIA’s implicit question in Apprendi—\\nwhat, exactly, does the “right to trial by jury” guaran-\\ntee?—is that it guarantees a jury’s determination of facts\\nthat constitute the elements of a crime. 530 U. S., at 498–\\n499 (concurring opinion).\\n  Although I have set forth these minority views be-\\nfore, see Booker, supra, at 326 (opinion dissenting in part);\\nBlakely, supra, at 328 (dissenting opinion); Apprendi, su-\\npra, at 555 (same), I repeat this point now to make clear\\nwhy I cannot accept the dissent’s characterization of the\\nSixth Amendment as simply seeking to prevent “judicial\\noverreaching” when sentencing facts are at issue, post,\\nat 4. At the very least, the Amendment seeks to protect\\ndefendants against “the wishes and opinions of the gov-\\nernment” as well. Ibid. (quoting Story, supra, §924, at\\n657). And, that being so, it seems to me highly anomalous\\nto read Apprendi as insisting that juries find sentencing\\nfacts that permit a judge to impose a higher sentence\\nwhile not insisting that juries find sentencing facts that\\nrequire a judge to impose a higher sentence. See Harris,\\nsupra, at 569–570 (opinion of BREYER, J.).\\n  To overrule Harris and to apply Apprendi’s basic jury-\\ndetermination rule to mandatory minimum sentences\\nwould erase that anomaly. Where a maximum sentence is\\nat issue, Apprendi means that a judge who wishes to im-\\npose a higher sentence cannot do so unless a jury finds the\\nrequisite statutory factual predicate. Where a manda-\\ntory minimum sentence is at issue, application of Apprendi\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            3\\n\\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\\n\\nwould mean that the government cannot force a judge who\\ndoes not wish to impose a higher sentence to do so unless\\na jury finds the requisite statutory factual predicate. In\\nboth instances the matter concerns higher sentences; in\\nboth instances factfinding must trigger the increase; in both\\ninstances jury-based factfinding would act as a check: in\\nthe first instance, against a sentencing judge wrongly\\nimposing the higher sentence that the judge believes is\\nappropriate, and in the second instance, against a sentenc-\\ning judge wrongly being required to impose the higher\\nsentence that the judge believes is inappropriate.\\n  While Harris has been the law for 11 years, Apprendi\\nhas been the law for even longer; and I think the time has\\ncome to end this anomaly in Apprendi’s application. Con-\\nsequently, I vote to overrule Harris. I join Parts I, III–B,\\nIII–C, and IV of the Court’s opinion and concur in its\\njudgment.\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 570 U.

Such a provi-\\nsion affects the role of the judge—limiting his discretion—\\nbut has no effect on the role of the jury. And because it\\ndoes not affect the jury’s role, it does not violate the jury\\ntrial guarantee of the Sixth Amendment.\\n   The Framers envisioned the Sixth Amendment as a pro-\\ntection for defendants from the power of the Government.\\nThe Court transforms it into a protection for judges from\\nthe power of the legislature. For that reason, I respect-\\nfully dissent.\\n                          I\\n  In a steady stream of cases decided over the last 15\\nyears, this Court has sought to identify the historical\\n\\x0c2               ALLEYNE v.

Our key sources in this task have\\nbeen 19th-century treatises and common law cases identi-\\nfying which facts qualified as “elements” of a crime, and\\ntherefore had to be alleged in the indictment and proved to\\na jury beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., Apprendi v.\\nNew Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 476–483, 489–490, n. 15 (2000)\\n(collecting sources); id., at 501–518 (THOMAS, J., concur-\\nring) (same). With remarkable uniformity, those author-\\nities provided that an element was “whatever is in law\\nessential to the punishment sought to be inflicted.” 1 J.\\nBishop, Criminal Procedure 50 (2d ed. 1872); see also\\nApprendi, supra, at 489, n. 15 (“ ‘[T]he indictment must\\ncontain an allegation of every fact which is legally essen-\\ntial to the punishment to be inflicted’ ” (quoting United\\nStates v. Reese, 92 U. S. 214, 232 (1876) (Clifford, J., dis-\\nsenting))); 1 Bishop, supra, §87, at 55 (an indictment must\\ninclude “any particular fact which the law makes essential\\nto the punishment”).\\n   Judging that this common law rule best reflects what\\nthe Framers understood the Sixth Amendment jury right\\nto protect, we have struck down sentencing schemes that\\nwere inconsistent with the rule. In Apprendi, for example,\\nthe defendant pleaded guilty to a crime that carried a\\nmaximum sentence of ten years. After his plea, however,\\nthe trial judge determined that the defendant had commit-\\nted the crime with a biased purpose. Under a New Jersey\\nlaw, that finding allowed the judge to impose up to ten\\nadditional years in prison. Exercising that authority, the\\njudge sentenced the defendant to 12 years. 530 U. S., at\\n469–471.\\n   Because the sentence was two years longer than would\\nhave been possible without the finding of bias, that find-\\ning was “essential to the punishment” imposed. 1 Bishop,\\nsupra, at 50; see Apprendi, 530 U.

Id., at 497.\\n   Subsequent cases have worked out how this principle\\napplies in other contexts, such as capital sentencing re-\\ngimes, state and federal sentencing guidelines, or criminal\\nfines. See Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584 (2002); Blakely v.\\nWashington, 542 U. S. 296 (2004); United States v. Booker,\\n543 U. S. 220 (2005); Southern Union Co. v. United\\nStates, 567 U. S. ___ (2012). Through all of them, we have\\nadhered to the rule, rooted in the common law under-\\nstanding described above, that we laid down in Apprendi:\\n“Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that\\nincreases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed\\nstatutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and\\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt.” 530 U. S., at 490; see\\nBlakely, supra, at 301 (quoting above statement); Booker,\\nsupra, at 231 (same); Southern Union Co., supra, at ___\\n(slip op., at 3) (same); see also Ring, supra, at 588–589\\n(Sixth Amendment “does not permit a defendant to be\\n‘expose[d] . . . to a penalty exceeding the maximum he\\nwould receive if punished according to the facts reflected\\nin the jury verdict alone’ ” (quoting Apprendi, supra, at\\n483; alterations in original).\\n   We have embraced this 19th-century common law rule\\nbased not only on a judgment that it reflects the under-\\nstanding in place when the Sixth Amendment was rati-\\nfied, but also on the “need to give intelligible content to the\\nright of jury trial.” Blakely, supra, at 305. As JUSTICE\\nSCALIA wrote in Apprendi, it is unclear “what the right to\\ntrial by jury does guarantee if . . . it does not guarantee . . .\\nthe right to have a jury determine those facts that deter-\\nmine the maximum sentence the law allows.” 530 U. S., at\\n498–499 (concurring opinion).\\n   After all, if a judge’s factfinding could authorize a sen-\\ntence beyond that allowed by the jury’s verdict alone, the\\njury trial would be “a mere preliminary to a judicial inqui-\\n\\x0c4                ALLEYNE v.

The Framers clearly\\nenvisioned a more robust role for the jury. They appreci-\\nated the danger inherent in allowing “justices . . . named\\nby the crown” to “imprison, dispatch, or exile any man that\\nwas obnoxious to the government, by an instant declara-\\ntion, that such is their will and pleasure.” 4 W. Black-\\nstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 343 (1769).\\nTo guard against this “violence and partiality of judges\\nappointed by the crown,” the common law “wisely placed\\nth[e] strong . . . barrier, of . . . trial by jury, between the\\nliberties of the people, and the prerogative of the crown.”\\nIbid. The Sixth Amendment therefore provided for trial\\nby jury as a “double security, against the prejudices of\\njudges, who may partake of the wishes and opinions of the\\ngovernment, and against the passions of the multitude,\\nwho may demand their victim with a clamorous precipi-\\ntancy.” J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the\\nUnited States §924, p. 657 (Abr. 1833); see also The Fed-\\neralist No. 83, p. 499 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton)\\n(discussing criminal jury trial as a protection against\\n“judicial despotism”). Our holdings that a judge may not\\nsentence a defendant to more than the jury has authorized\\nproperly preserve the jury right as a guard against judicial\\noverreaching.\\n                              II\\n   There is no such risk of judicial overreaching here.\\nUnder 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A)(i), the jury’s verdict fully\\nauthorized the judge to impose a sentence of anywhere\\nfrom five years to life in prison. No additional finding of\\nfact was “essential” to any punishment within the range.\\nAfter rendering the verdict, the jury’s role was completed,\\nit was discharged, and the judge began the process of\\ndetermining where within that range to set Alleyne’s\\nsentence.\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 570 U.

J., dissenting\\n\\n  Everyone agrees that in making that determination, the\\njudge was free to consider any relevant facts about the of-\\nfense and offender, including facts not found by the jury\\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\\n    “[B]oth before and since the American colonies became\\n    a nation, courts . . . practiced a policy under which a\\n    sentencing judge could exercise a wide discretion in the\\n    sources and types of evidence used to assist him in\\n    determining the kind and extent of punishment to be\\n    imposed within limits fixed by law.” Williams v. New\\n    York, 337 U. S. 241, 246 (1949).\\nAs Apprendi itself recognized, “nothing in this history\\nsuggests that it is impermissible for judges to exercise\\ndiscretion—taking into consideration various factors\\nrelating both to offense and offender—in imposing a judg-\\nment within the range prescribed by statute.” 530 U. S.,\\nat 481 (emphasis deleted); see also Dillon v. United States,\\n560 U. S. __, __ (2010) (slip op., at 11). And the majority\\ndoes not dispute the point. Ante, at 15 (“Our ruling today\\ndoes not mean that any fact that influences judicial discre-\\ntion must be found by a jury.”). Thus, under the majority’s\\nrule, in the absence of a statutory mandatory minimum,\\nthere would have been no constitutional problem had the\\njudge, exercising the discretion given him by the jury’s\\nverdict, decided that seven years in prison was the appro-\\npriate penalty for the crime because of his finding that the\\nfirearm had been brandished during the offense.\\n   In my view, that is enough to resolve this case. The\\njury’s verdict authorized the judge to impose the precise\\nsentence he imposed for the precise factual reason he\\nimposed it. As we have recognized twice before, the Sixth\\nAmendment demands nothing more. See Harris v. United\\nStates, 536 U. S. 545, 568–569 (2002); McMillan v. Penn-\\nsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 93 (1986).\\n\\x0c6               ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\\n\\n                              III\\n   This approach is entirely consistent with Apprendi. As\\nI have explained, Apprendi’s constraint on the normal\\nlegislative control of criminal procedure draws its legiti-\\nmacy from two primary principles: (1) common law under-\\nstandings of the “elements” of a crime, and (2) the need to\\npreserve the jury as a “strong barrier” between defendants\\nand the State. Neither of those principles supports the\\nrule the majority adopts today.\\n   First, there is no body of historical evidence supporting\\ntoday’s new rule. The majority does not identify a single\\ncase holding that a fact affecting only the sentencing floor\\nqualified as an element or had to be found by a jury, nor\\ndoes it point to any treatise language to that effect. Ante,\\nat 8–10. To be sure, the relatively recent vintage of man-\\ndatory minimum sentencing enhancements means that\\nfew, if any, 19th-century courts would have encountered\\nsuch a fact pattern. So I do not mean to suggest that\\nthe absence of historical condemnation of the practice con-\\nclusively establishes its constitutionality today. But given\\nthat Apprendi’s rule rests heavily on affirmative historical\\nevidence about the practices to which we have previously\\napplied it, the lack of such evidence on statutory mini-\\nmums is a good reason not to extend it here.\\n   Nor does the majority’s extension of Apprendi do any-\\nthing to preserve the role of the jury as a safeguard be-\\ntween the defendant and the State. That is because even\\nif a jury does not find that the firearm was brandished,\\na judge can do so and impose a harsher sentence because\\nof his finding, so long as that sentence remains under the\\nstatutory maximum. The question here is about the power\\nof judges, not juries. Under the rule in place until today,\\na legislature could tell judges that certain facts carried\\ncertain weight, and require the judge to devise a sentence\\nbased on that weight—so long as the sentence remained\\nwithin the range authorized by the jury. Now, in the\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            7\\n\\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\\n\\nname of the jury right that formed a barrier between the\\ndefendant and the State, the majority has erected a bar-\\nrier between judges and legislatures, establishing that\\ndiscretionary sentencing is the domain of judges. Legisla-\\ntures must keep their respectful distance.\\n   I find this new rule impossible to square with the histor-\\nical understanding of the jury right as a defense from\\njudges, not a defense of judges. See Apprendi, supra, at\\n498 (SCALIA, J., concurring) (“Judges, it is sometimes\\nnecessary to remind ourselves, are part of the State”).\\nJust as the Sixth Amendment “limits judicial power only\\nto the extent that the claimed judicial power infringes on\\nthe province of the jury,” Blakely, 542 U. S., at 308, so too\\nit limits legislative power only to the extent that power\\ninfringes on the province of the jury. Because the claimed\\ninfringement here is on the province of the judge, not the\\njury, the jury right has no work to do.\\n                               IV\\n   The majority offers several arguments to the contrary. I\\ndo not find them persuasive.\\n   First, the majority asserts that “because the legally\\nprescribed range is the penalty affixed to the crime, it\\nfollows that a fact increasing either end of the range pro-\\nduces a new penalty and constitutes an ingredient of the\\noffense.” Ante, at 11 (citation omitted). The syllogism\\ntrips out of the gate, for its first premise—that the consti-\\ntutionally relevant “penalty” includes the bottom end of\\nthe statutory range—simply assumes the answer to the\\nquestion presented. Neither of the historical sources to\\nwhich the majority points gives an answer: The Bishop\\ntreatise speaks only to situations in which “a statute\\nprescribes a particular punishment,” not a range of possi-\\nble punishments. 1 Bishop, Criminal Procedure §598, at\\n360–361. The Wharton treatise is similarly unhelpful,\\nfocusing on statutes that change the maximum or alter the\\n\\x0c8               ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\\n\\nnature of the common law crime. See 1 F. Wharton, Crim-\\ninal Law §371, p. 291 (rev. 7th ed. 1874). The sources\\nprovided in the Apprendi concurrence offer no support, for\\nas already discussed, we lack historical evidence about the\\ntreatment of facts that altered only the floor of a sentenc-\\ning range.\\n   Second, the majority observes that “criminal statutes\\nhave long specified both the floor and ceiling of sentence\\nranges, which is evidence that both define the legally\\nprescribed penalty.” Ante, at 11. Again, though, this\\nsimply assumes the core premise: That the constitution-\\nally relevant “penalty” involves both the statutory minimum\\nand the maximum. Unless one accepts that premise on\\nfaith, the fact that statutes have long specified both floor\\nand ceiling is evidence of nothing more than that stat-\\nutes have long specified both the floor and the ceiling. Nor\\ndoes it help to say that “the floor of a mandatory range is\\nas relevant to wrongdoers as the ceiling.” Ante, at 12. The\\nmeaning of the Sixth Amendment does not turn on what\\nwrongdoers care about most.\\n   More importantly, legal rules frequently focus on the\\nmaximum sentence while ignoring the minimum, even\\nthough both are “relevant” to punishment. Closest to this\\ncase, the question whether the jury right applies at all\\nturns on whether the maximum sentence exceeds six\\nmonths—not, say, whether the minimum punishment\\ninvolves time in prison. Blanton v. North Las Vegas, 489\\nU. S. 538, 543 (1989); see also Lewis v. United States, 518\\nU. S. 322, 326 (1996) (“In evaluating the seriousness of the\\noffense, we place primary emphasis on the maximum\\nprison term authorized”). Likewise, the rights to vote and\\nto bear arms are typically denied to felons—that is, those\\nconvicted of a crime with a maximum sentence of more\\nthan one year in prison. See Richardson v. Ramirez, 418\\nU. S. 24, 48 (1974); District of Columbia v. Heller, 554\\nU. S. 570, 626 (2008); Black’s Law Dictionary 694 (9th ed.\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 570 U. S. ____ (2013)            9\\n\\n                   ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting\\n\\n2009). Examples of other distinctions turning only on max-\\nimum penalties abound, as in cases of recidivism en-\\nhancements that apply only to prior convictions with a\\nmaximum sentence of more than a specified number of\\nyears. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2). That a minimum\\nsentence is “relevant” to punishment, and that a statute\\ndefines it, does not mean it must be treated the same as\\nthe maximum sentence the law allows.\\n   Third, the majority offers that “it is impossible to dis-\\npute that facts increasing the legally prescribed floor\\naggravate the punishment.” Ante, at 12. This argument\\nproves too much, for it would apply with equal force to any\\nfact which leads the judge, in the exercise of his own dis-\\ncretion, to choose a penalty higher than he otherwise\\nwould have chosen. The majority nowhere explains what\\nit is about the jury right that bars a determination by\\nCongress that brandishing (or any other fact) makes an\\noffense worth two extra years, but not an identical deter-\\nmination by a judge. Simply calling one “aggravation” and\\nthe other “discretion” does not do the trick.\\n   Fourth, the majority argues that “[i]t is no answer to say\\nthat the defendant could have received the same sentence\\nwith or without” a particular factual finding, pointing out\\n“that a defendant could not be convicted and sentenced for\\nassault, if the jury only finds the facts for larceny, even if\\nthe punishments prescribed for each crime are identical.”\\nAnte, at 14. In that hypothetical case, the legislature has\\nchosen to define two crimes with two different sets of\\nelements. Courts must, of course, respect that legislative\\njudgment. But that tells us nothing about when courts\\ncan override the legislature’s decision not to create sepa-\\nrate crimes, and instead to treat a particular fact as a\\ntrigger for a minimum sentence within the already-\\nauthorized range.\\n\\x0c10              ALLEYNE v.

See ante, at 16, n. 6.\\nStare decisis is, of course, not an “inexorable command”\\nin the field of constitutional law. Payne v. Tennessee, 501\\nU. S. 808, 828 (1991). Nevertheless, the Court ought to be\\nconsistent in its willingness to reconsider precedent. If\\nHarris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545 (2002), and McMil-\\nlan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986), can be cast aside\\nsimply because a majority of this Court now disagrees\\nwith them, that same approach may properly be followed\\nin future cases. See Arizona v. Gant, 556 U. S. 332, 358–\\n364 (2009) (ALITO, J., dissenting).\\n  If the Court is of a mind to reconsider existing prece-\\ndent, a prime candidate should be Apprendi v. New Jersey,\\n530 U. S. 466 (2000). Although Apprendi purported to rely\\non the original understanding of the jury trial right, there\\nare strong reasons to question the Court’s analysis on that\\npoint. See, e.g., Bibas, Judicial Fact-Finding and Sentence\\nEnhancements in a World of Guilty Pleas, 110 Yale L. J.\\n1097, 1123–1132 (2001) (critiquing the historical evidence\\nrelied upon by the Apprendi majority and concurrence,\\nand concluding (1) that the “broad judicial discretion”\\ncharacteristic of eighteenth-century common-law misde-\\nmeanor sentencing “undercuts the suggestion that sen-\\n\\x0c2                  ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                         ALITO, J., dissenting\\n\\ntencing was the sacred province of juries alone,” (2) that\\neven the “nineteenth-century tradition was not uniform,\\nsuggesting that the common law had no fixed rule on the\\nsubject,” and (3) that “no eighteenth-century evidence\\nlink[ed] this [nineteenth-century] tradition back to the time\\nof the Founding”); Little & Chen, The Lost History of\\nApprendi and the Blakely Petition for Rehearing, 17 Fed.\\nSentencing Rep. 69, 69–74 (2004) (“Blakely and Apprendi\\nwere undoubtedly founded on an erroneous historical un-\\nderstanding of the Framers’ views in 1790 when they\\nwrote the 6th Amendment’s jury-trial guarantee. The fact\\nthat the Framers themselves wrote over a dozen indeter-\\nminate sentencing ranges in the first federal crime bill (see\\n1 Stat. 112–118 . . .), has simply been overlooked by the\\nCourt”); Mitchell, Apprendi’s Domain, 2006 Sup. Ct. Rev.\\n297, 298–299 (2006) (arguing, in the context of defending\\na broader conception of the jury right, that “Apprendi’s\\nhistorical claim that sentencing enhancements were treated\\nas ‘elements’ of offenses whenever they increased a de-\\nfendant’s maximum punishment is demonstrably mis-\\ntaken” and that “the platitudes from Joel Prentiss Bishop’s\\nnineteenth-century treatises, which the pro-Apprendi\\nJustices repeatedly invoke to support this assertion [that\\nsentencing enhancements that increased a maximum pun-\\nishment were treated as elements of the offense], are pat-\\nently false and did not accurately describe the law in\\nactual court decisions of that era” (footnotes omitted)).\\n   The Court’s decision creates a precedent about prece-\\ndent that may have greater precedential effect than the\\ndubious decisions on which it relies.*\\n——————\\n  * Speaking for herself, JUSTICE GINSBURG, and JUSTICE KAGAN—but\\nnot for the Court—JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR argues that Harris’ stare decisis\\nvalue is undermined by the subsequent reasoning of the Court’s Ap-\\nprendi line of cases and by the fact that no one rationale in Harris\\ncommanded five votes. I disagree.\\n  In my view, Harris’ force is not vitiated by the Court’s Apprendi line\\n\\x0c                     Cite as: 570 U.

First, that line of cases is predicated on a\\npurported Sixth Amendment requirement that juries find facts that\\nincrease maximum penalties, not mandatory minimums. Accordingly,\\nas THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s dissent persuasively explains, ante, at 1–7,\\nApprendi and its progeny have no impact on the distinct question\\nresolved by Harris, which does not bear on the jury right. Second, the\\nApprendi line is now too intellectually incoherent to undermine any\\n“contrary” precedents. If the rationale of Apprendi—which, as broadly\\nconstrued by the Court in this case, is that “[a]ny fact that, by law,\\nincreases the penalty for a crime is an ‘element’ that must be submitted\\nto the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt,” ante, at 1—were\\ntaken seriously, discretionary sentencing, as prescribed by 18 U. S. C.\\n§3553(a), should also be held to violate the Sixth Amendment. But a\\nmajority of the Court has not been willing to go where its reasoning\\nleads.\\n  Nor can it be correct to say that “Harris in no way strengthens the\\nforce of stare decisis in this case” because a “ ‘majority of the Court\\nexpressly disagreed with the rationale of [a] plurality.’ ” Ante, at 3–4\\n(SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring) (quoting Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida,\\n517 U. S. 44, 66 (1996)). Decisions in which no one rationale commands\\na majority of the Court—including prominent decisions based on the\\nviews of a single Justice—are often thought to have precedential effect.\\nSee, e.g., United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005); Regents of Univ.\\nof Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 269–272 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.).\\nAnd, of course, if Harris is not entitled to stare decisis weight, then\\nneither is the Court’s opinion in this case. After all, only four Members\\nof the Court think that the Court’s holding is the correct reading of\\nthe Constitution. See ante, at 1–3 (BREYER, J., concurring in part and\\nconcurring in judgment).\\n  As she concedes, ante, at 4, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s concurrence is nec-\\nessarily selective in its discussion of the factors that the Court has\\npreviously found to be relevant to the application of stare decisis. For\\nexample, she does not argue—presumably because there is no good\\nargument to be made—that Harris and McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477\\nU. S. 79 (1986) (which provide the framework under which criminal\\nprosecutions have been carried out for at least the past 27 years) have\\nproved “ ‘unworkable.’ ” Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267, 306 (2004)\\n(plurality opinion) (quoting Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827\\n(1991)). Nor does she contend that “circumstances” outside the Court\\n“have changed so radically as to undermine [Harris’] critical factual\\nassumptions.” Randall v. Sorrell, 548 U. S. 230, 244 (2006) (plurality\\nopinion). Indeed, no party or amicus has cited any such circumstances.\\n  In short, other than the fact that there are currently five Justices\\n\\x0c4                   ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                          ALITO, J., dissenting\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n——————\\nwilling to vote to overrule Harris, and not five Justices willing to\\noverrule Apprendi, there is no compelling reason why the Court over-\\nrules the former rather than the latter. If the opportunity arises in the\\nfuture to overrule Apprendi or the present case—both of which presum-\\nably involve “procedural rules . . . that do not govern primary conduct\\nand do not implicate the reliance interests of private parties,” ante, at 2\\n(SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring)—the precedent the Court sets today will be\\nrelevant to the issue of stare decisis.\\n\\x0c'}]\n",

UNITED STATES\\n\\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\\n                 THE TENTH CIRCUIT\\n\\n   No. 06–11543.       Argued January 15, 2008—Decided April 16, 2008\\nThe Armed Career Criminal Act (Act) imposes a special mandatory 15-\\n  year prison term upon a felon who unlawfully possesses a firearm\\n  and who has three or more prior convictions for committing certain\\n  drug crimes or “a violent felony.” 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(1). The Act de-\\n  fines “violent felony” as, inter alia, a crime punishable by more than\\n  one year’s imprisonment that “is burglary, arson, or extortion, in-\\n  volves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a\\n  serious potential risk of physical injury to another.” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\\n  (hereinafter clause (ii)). After petitioner Begay pleaded guilty to fel-\\n  ony possession of a firearm, his presentence report revealed he had\\n  12 New Mexico convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol\\n  (DUI), which state law makes a felony (punishable by a prison term\\n  of more than one year) the fourth (or subsequent) time an individual\\n  commits it. Based on these convictions, the sentencing judge con-\\n  cluded that Begay had three or more “violent felony” convictions and,\\n  therefore, sentenced him to an enhanced 15-year sentence. The\\n  Tenth Circuit rejected Begay’s claim that DUI is not a “violent fel-\\n  ony” under the Act.\\nHeld: New Mexico’s felony DUI crime falls outside the scope of the\\n Act’s clause (ii) “violent felony” definition. Pp. 3–10.\\n    (a) Whether a crime is a violent felony is determined by how the\\n law defines it and not how an individual offender might have com-\\n mitted it on a particular occasion. Pp. 3–4.\\n    (b) Even assuming that DUI involves conduct that “presents a seri-\\n ous potential risk of physical injury to another” under clause (ii), the\\n crime falls outside the clause’s scope because it is simply too unlike\\n clause (ii)’s example crimes to indicate that Congress intended that\\n provision to cover it. Pp. 4–10.\\n\\x0c2                       BEGAY v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                                  Syllabus\\n\\n         (i) Clause (ii)’s listed examples—burglary, arson, extortion, and\\n    crimes involving the use of explosives—should be read as limiting the\\n    crimes the clause covers to those that are roughly similar, in kind as\\n    well as in degree of risk posed, to the examples themselves. Their\\n    presence in the statute indicates that Congress meant for the statute\\n    to cover only similar crimes, rather than every crime that “presents a\\n    serious potential risk of physical injury to another,” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii).\\n    If Congress meant the statute to be all encompassing, it would not\\n    have needed to include the examples at all. Moreover, if clause (ii)\\n    were meant to include all risky crimes, Congress likely would not\\n    have included clause (i), which includes crimes that have “as an ele-\\n    ment the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\\n    against the person of another.” And had Congress included the ex-\\n    amples solely for quantitative purposes, demonstrating no more than\\n    the degree of risk of physical injury sufficient to bring a crime within\\n    the statute’s scope, it would likely have chosen examples that better\\n    illustrated the degree of risk it had in mind rather than these that\\n    are far from clear in respect to the degree of risk each poses. The\\n    Government’s argument that the word “otherwise” just after the ex-\\n    amples is sufficient to demonstrate that they do not limit the clause’s\\n    scope is rejected because “otherwise” can refer to a crime that is, e.g.,\\n    similar to the examples in respect to the degree of risk it produces,\\n    but different in respect to the way or manner in which it produces\\n    that risk. Pp. 4–7.\\n         (ii) DUI differs from the example crimes in at least one impor-\\n    tant respect: The examples typically involve purposeful, violent, and\\n    aggressive conduct, whereas DUI statutes typically do not. When\\n    viewed in terms of the Act’s purposes, this distinction matters con-\\n    siderably. The Act looks to past crimes to determine which offenders\\n    create a special danger by possessing a gun. In this respect, a history\\n    of crimes involving purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct, which\\n    shows an increased likelihood that the offender is the kind of person\\n    who might deliberately point a gun and pull the trigger, is different\\n    from a history of DUI, which does not involve the deliberate kind of\\n    behavior associated with violent criminal use of firearms.

S. C. §924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp.\\nV). The question in this case is whether driving under the\\ninfluence of alcohol is a “violent felony” as the Act defines\\nit. We conclude that it is not.\\n                               I\\n\\n                              A\\n\\n  Federal law prohibits a previously convicted felon from\\npossessing a firearm. §922(g)(1) (2000 ed.). A related\\nprovision provides for a prison term of up to 10 years for\\nan ordinary offender. §924(a)(2). The Armed Career\\nCriminal Act imposes a more stringent 15-year mandatory\\nminimum sentence on an offender who has three prior\\nconvictions “for a violent felony or a serious drug offense.”\\n§924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V).\\n  The Act defines a “violent felony” as “any crime punish-\\nable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year” that\\n    “(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or\\n\\x0c2                BEGAY v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                     Opinion of the Court\\n\\n    threatened use of physical force against the person of\\n    another; or\\n    “(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of\\n    explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that pre-\\n    sents a serious potential risk of physical injury to an-\\n    other.” §924(e)(2)(B) (2000 ed.).\\nWe here consider whether driving under the influence of\\nalcohol (DUI), as set forth in New Mexico’s criminal stat-\\nutes, falls within the scope of the second clause.\\n                             B\\n   The relevant background circumstances include the\\nfollowing: In September 2004, New Mexico police officers\\nreceived a report that Larry Begay, the petitioner here,\\nhad threatened his sister and aunt with a rifle. The police\\narrested him. Begay subsequently conceded he was a\\nfelon and pleaded guilty to a federal charge of unlawful\\npossession of a firearm in violation of §922(g)(1). Begay’s\\npresentence report said that he had been convicted a\\ndozen times for DUI, which under New Mexico’s law,\\nbecomes a felony (punishable by a prison term of more\\nthan one year) the fourth (or subsequent) time an individ-\\nual commits it. See N. M. Stat. Ann. §§66–8–102(G) to (J)\\n(Supp. 2007). The sentencing judge consequently found\\nthat Begay had at least three prior convictions for a crime\\n“punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one\\nyear.” 377 F. Supp. 2d 1141, 1143 (NM 2005). The judge\\nalso concluded that Begay’s “three felony DUI convictions\\ninvolve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of\\nphysical injury to another.” Id., at 1145. The judge con-\\nsequently concluded that Begay had three or more prior\\nconvictions for a “violent felony” and should receive a\\nsentence that reflected a mandatory minimum prison term\\nof 15 years. Ibid.\\n   Begay, claiming that DUI is not a “violent felony” within\\nthe terms of the statute, appealed. The Court of Appeals\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)            3\\n\\n                      Opinion of the Court\\n\\npanel by a vote of 2 to 1 rejected that claim. 470 F. 3d 964\\n(CA10 2006). Begay sought certiorari, and we agreed to\\ndecide the question.\\n                              II \\n\\n                              A\\n\\n   New Mexico’s DUI statute makes it a crime (and a\\nfelony after three earlier convictions) to “drive a vehicle\\nwithin [the] state” if the driver “is under the influence of\\nintoxicating liquor” (or has an alcohol concentration of .08\\nor more in his blood or breath within three hours of having\\ndriven the vehicle resulting from “alcohol consumed before\\nor while driving the vehicle”). §§66–8–102(A), (C). In\\ndetermining whether this crime is a violent felony, we\\nconsider the offense generically, that is to say, we examine\\nit in terms of how the law defines the offense and not in\\nterms of how an individual offender might have committed\\nit on a particular occasion. See Taylor v. United States,\\n495 U. S. 575, 602 (1990) (adopting this “categorical ap-\\nproach”); see also James v. United States, 550 U. S. ___ ,\\n___ (2007) (slip op., at 14–15) (attempted burglary is a\\nviolent felony even if, on some occasions, it can be commit-\\nted in a way that poses no serious risk of physical harm).\\n   We also take as a given that DUI does not fall within\\nthe scope of the Act’s clause (i) “violent felony” definition.\\nDUI, as New Mexico defines it, nowhere “has as an ele-\\nment the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical\\nforce against the person of another.”             18 U. S. C.\\n§924(e)(2)(B)(i).\\n   Finally, we assume that the lower courts were right in\\nconcluding that DUI involves conduct that “presents a\\nserious potential risk of physical injury to another.”\\n§924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Drunk driving is an extremely dangerous\\ncrime. In the United States in 2006, alcohol-related motor\\nvehicle crashes claimed the lives of more than 17,000\\nindividuals and harmed untold amounts of property.\\n\\x0c4                 BEGAY v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                      Opinion of the Court\\n\\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Admin., Traffic Safety\\nFacts, 2006 Traffic Safety Annual Assessment—Alcohol-\\nRelated Fatalities 1 (No. 810821, Aug. 2007), http://www-\\nnrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/810821.PDF (as visited Apr. 11,\\n2008, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file). Even so,\\nwe find that DUI falls outside the scope of clause (ii). It is\\nsimply too unlike the provision’s listed examples for us to\\nbelieve that Congress intended the provision to cover it.\\n                               B\\n                               1\\n   In our view, the provision’s listed examples—burglary,\\narson, extortion, or crimes involving the use of explo-\\nsives—illustrate the kinds of crimes that fall within the\\nstatute’s scope. Their presence indicates that the statute\\ncovers only similar crimes, rather than every crime that\\n“presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\\nanother.” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). If Congress meant the latter,\\ni.e., if it meant the statute to be all-encompassing, it is\\nhard to see why it would have needed to include the ex-\\namples at all. Without them, clause (ii) would cover all\\ncrimes that present a “serious potential risk of physical\\ninjury.” Ibid. Additionally, if Congress meant clause (ii)\\nto include all risky crimes, why would it have included\\nclause (i)? A crime which has as an element the “use,\\nattempted use, or threatened use of physical force” against\\nthe person (as clause (i) specifies) is likely to create “a\\nserious potential risk of physical injury” and would seem\\nto fall within the scope of clause (ii).\\n   Of course, Congress might have included the examples\\nsolely for quantitative purposes. Congress might have\\nintended them to demonstrate no more than the degree of\\nrisk sufficient to bring a crime within the statute’s scope.\\nBut were that the case, Congress would have likely chosen\\nexamples that better illustrated the “degree of risk” it had\\nin mind. Our recent case, James v. United States—where\\n\\x0c                   Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)              5\\n\\n                       Opinion of the Court\\n\\nwe considered only matters of degree, i.e., whether the\\namount of risk posed by attempted burglary was compara-\\nble to the amount of risk posed by the example crime of\\nburglary—illustrates the difficulty of interpreting the\\nexamples in this respect. Compare 550 U. S., at ___ (slip\\nop., at 9–13), with id., at ___ (slip op., at 2, 5–6, 16–17)\\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting). Indeed, the examples are so far\\nfrom clear in respect to the degree of risk each poses that\\nit is difficult to accept clarification in respect to degree of\\nrisk as Congress’ only reason for including them. See id.,\\nat ___ (slip op., at 16–17) (“Congress provided examples\\n[that] . . . have little in common, most especially with\\nrespect to the level of risk of physical injury that they\\npose”).\\n    These considerations taken together convince us that,\\n“ ‘to give effect . . . to every clause and word’ ” of this stat-\\nute, we should read the examples as limiting the crimes\\nthat clause (ii) covers to crimes that are roughly similar,\\nin kind as well as in degree of risk posed, to the examples\\nthemselves. Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174 (2001)\\n(quoting United States v. Menasche, 348 U. S. 528, 538–\\n539 (1955); some internal quotation marks omitted); see\\nalso Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 12 (2004) (describing\\nthe need to interpret a statute in a way that gives mean-\\ning to each word).\\n    The concurrence complains that our interpretive ap-\\nproach is insufficiently specific. See post, at 3–4 (SCALIA,\\nJ., concurring in judgment). But the concurrence’s own\\napproach demands a crime-by-crime analysis, uses a\\nstandard of measurement (comparative degree of risk)\\nthat even the concurrence admits is often “unclear,” post,\\nat 4, requires the concurrence to turn here to the still less\\nclear “rule of lenity,” post, at 6, and, as we explain, is less\\nlikely to reflect Congress’ intent.

UNITED STATES\\n\\n                      Opinion of the Court\\n\\n   The statute’s history offers further support for our\\nconclusion that the examples in clause (ii) limit the scope\\nof the clause to crimes that are similar to the examples\\nthemselves. Prior to the enactment of the current lan-\\nguage, the Act applied its enhanced sentence to offenders\\nwith “three previous convictions for robbery or burglary.”\\nTaylor, 495 U. S., at 581 (internal quotation marks omit-\\nted). Congress sought to expand that definition to include\\nboth crimes against the person (clause (i)) and certain\\nphysically risky crimes against property (clause (ii)). See\\nH. R. Rep. No. 99–849, p. 3 (1986) (hereinafter H. R. Rep.).\\nWhen doing so, Congress rejected a broad proposal that\\nwould have covered every offense that involved a substan-\\ntial risk of the use of “ ‘physical force against the person or\\nproperty of another.’ ” Taylor, supra, at 583 (quoting S.\\n2312, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. (1986); H. R. 4639, 99th Cong.,\\n2d Sess. (1986)). Instead, it added the present examples.\\nAnd in the relevant House Report, it described clause (ii)\\nas including “State and Federal felonies against property\\nsuch as burglary, arson, extortion, use of explosives and\\nsimilar crimes as predicate offenses where the conduct\\ninvolved presents a serious risk of injury to a person.”\\nH. R. Rep., at 5 (emphasis added).\\n   Of course, the statute places the word “otherwise,” just\\nafter the examples, so that the provision covers a felony\\nthat is one of the example crimes “or otherwise involves\\nconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical\\ninjury.” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added). But we cannot\\nagree with the Government that the word “otherwise” is\\nsufficient to demonstrate that the examples do not limit\\nthe scope of the clause. That is because the word “other-\\nwise” can (we do not say must, cf. post, at 4 (SCALIA, J.,\\nconcurring in judgment)) refer to a crime that is similar to\\nthe listed examples in some respects but different in oth-\\ners—similar say in respect to the degree of risk it pro-\\nduces, but different in respect to the “way or manner” in\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 553 U.

The listed crimes all typically involve purposeful,\\n“violent,” and “aggressive” conduct. 470 F. 3d, at 980\\n(McConnell, J., dissenting in part); see, e.g., Taylor, supra,\\nat 598 (“burglary” is an unlawful or unprivileged entry\\ninto a building or other structure with “intent to commit a\\ncrime”); ALI Model Penal Code §220.1(1) (1985) (“arson” is\\ncausing a fire or explosion with “the purpose of,” e.g.,\\n“destroying a building . . . of another” or “damaging any\\nproperty . . . to collect insurance”); id., §223.4 (extortion is\\n“purposely” obtaining property of another through threat\\nof, e.g., inflicting “bodily injury”); Leocal, supra, at 9 (the\\nword “ ‘use’ . . . most naturally suggests a higher degree of\\nintent than negligent or merely accidental conduct” which\\nfact helps bring it outside the scope of the statutory term\\n“crime of violence”). That conduct is such that it makes\\nmore likely that an offender, later possessing a gun, will\\nuse that gun deliberately to harm a victim. Crimes com-\\nmitted in such a purposeful, violent, and aggressive man-\\nner are “potentially more dangerous when firearms are\\ninvolved.” 470 F. 3d, at 980 (McConnell, J., dissenting in\\npart). And such crimes are “characteristic of the armed\\ncareer criminal, the eponym of the statute.” Ibid.\\n   By way of contrast, statutes that forbid driving under\\nthe influence, such as the statute before us, typically do\\nnot insist on purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct;\\nrather, they are, or are most nearly comparable to, crimes\\nthat impose strict liability, criminalizing conduct in re-\\nspect to which the offender need not have had any crimi-\\n\\x0c8                 BEGAY v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                      Opinion of the Court\\n\\nnal intent at all. The Government argues that “the know-\\ning nature of the conduct that produces intoxication com-\\nbined with the inherent recklessness of the ensuing con-\\nduct more than suffices” to create an element of intent.\\nBrief for United States 35. And we agree with the Gov-\\nernment that a drunk driver may very well drink on pur-\\npose. But this Court has said that, unlike the example\\ncrimes, the conduct for which the drunk driver is convicted\\n(driving under the influence) need not be purposeful or\\ndeliberate. See Leocal, 543 U. S., at 11 (a DUI offense\\ninvolves “accidental or negligent conduct”); see also 470\\nF. 3d, at 980 (McConnell, J., dissenting in part) (“[D]runk\\ndriving is a crime of negligence or recklessness, rather\\nthan violence or aggression”).\\n   When viewed in terms of the Act’s basic purposes, this\\ndistinction matters considerably. As suggested by its title,\\nthe Armed Career Criminal Act focuses upon the special\\ndanger created when a particular type of offender—a\\nviolent criminal or drug trafficker—possesses a gun. See\\nTaylor, supra, at 587–588; 470 F. 3d, at 981, n. 3 (McCon-\\nnell, J., dissenting in part) (“[T]he title [of the Act] was not\\nmerely decorative”). In order to determine which offend-\\ners fall into this category, the Act looks to past crimes.\\nThis is because an offender’s criminal history is relevant\\nto the question whether he is a career criminal, or, more\\nprecisely, to the kind or degree of danger the offender\\nwould pose were he to possess a gun.\\n   In this respect—namely, a prior crime’s relevance to the\\npossibility of future danger with a gun—crimes involving\\nintentional or purposeful conduct (as in burglary and\\narson) are different than DUI, a strict liability crime. In\\nboth instances, the offender’s prior crimes reveal a degree\\nof callousness toward risk, but in the former instance they\\nalso show an increased likelihood that the offender is the\\nkind of person who might deliberately point the gun and\\npull the trigger. We have no reason to believe that Con-\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 553 U.

Code Ann. §8–4–\\n103(a)(2)(A)(ii) (2007) (reckless polluters); 33 U. S. C.\\n§1319(c)(1) (individuals who negligently introduce pollut-\\nants into the sewer system); 18 U. S. C. §1365(a) (indi-\\nviduals who recklessly tamper with consumer products);\\n§1115 (seamen whose inattention to duty causes serious\\naccidents). We have no reason to believe that Congress\\nintended to bring within the statute’s scope these kinds of\\ncrimes, far removed as they are from the deliberate kind of\\nbehavior associated with violent criminal use of firearms.\\nThe statute’s use of examples (and the other considera-\\ntions we have mentioned) indicate the contrary.\\n   The dissent’s approach, on the other hand, would likely\\ninclude these crimes within the statutory definition of\\n“violent felony,” along with any other crime that can be\\nsaid to present “a serious potential risk of physical injury.”\\nPost, at 2 (opinion of ALITO, J.). And it would do so be-\\ncause it believes such a result is compelled by the statute’s\\ntext. See ibid. But the dissent’s explanation does not\\naccount for a key feature of that text—namely, the four\\nexample crimes intended to illustrate what kind of “violent\\nfelony” the statute covers. The dissent at most believes\\nthat these examples are relevant only to define the “requi-\\nsite” serious risk associated with a “crime of violence.”\\nPost, at 6. But the dissent does not explain what it means\\nby “requisite,” nor does it describe how these various\\nexamples might help define that term in the context of\\nthis statute. If they were in fact helpful on that score, we\\nmight expect more predictable results from a purely risk-\\nbased approach. Compare post, at 1, 6–7 (SCALIA, J.,\\n\\x0c10                BEGAY v.

Thus, the dissent’s reliance on these examples\\nfor a function they appear incapable of performing reads\\nthem out of the statute and, in so doing, fails to effectuate\\nCongress’ purpose to punish only a particular subset of\\noffender, namely career criminals.\\n   The distinction we make does not minimize the serious-\\nness of the risks attached to driving under the influence.\\nNor does our argument deny that an individual with a\\ncriminal history of DUI might later pull the trigger of a\\ngun. (Indeed, we may have such an instance before us.\\n470 F. 3d, at 965.) Rather, we hold only that, for purposes\\nof the particular statutory provision before us, a prior\\nrecord of DUI, a strict liability crime, differs from a prior\\nrecord of violent and aggressive crimes committed inten-\\ntionally such as arson, burglary, extortion, or crimes in-\\nvolving the use of explosives. The latter are associated\\nwith a likelihood of future violent, aggressive, and pur-\\nposeful “armed career criminal” behavior in a way that the\\nformer are not.\\n   We consequently conclude that New Mexico’s crime of\\n“driving under the influence” falls outside the scope of the\\nArmed Career Criminal Act’s clause (ii) “violent felony”\\ndefinition. And we reverse the judgment of the Court of\\nAppeals in relevant part and remand the case for proceed-\\nings consistent with this opinion.\\n                                              It is so ordered.\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 553 U.

United States, 550 U. S. ___\\n(2007), the Court held that attempted burglary qualifies\\nas a violent felony under §924(e). It concluded that to\\ndetermine whether a predicate crime falls under the re-\\nsidual clause, a court should first identify the enumerated\\ncrime to which the predicate crime is most closely analo-\\ngous and then decide whether the risk posed by the predi-\\ncate crime is roughly equivalent to the risk posed by the\\nenumerated crime. Because burglary was the enumerated\\ncrime most closely analogous to attempted burglary, and\\nattempted burglary in the Court’s judgment posed roughly\\n\\x0c2                 BEGAY v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\\n\\nthe same risk of physical injury as burglary, attempted\\nburglary qualified as a “violent felony” under §924(e). See\\nid., at ____ (slip op., at 15).\\n   Unfortunately, the Court’s approach in deciding that\\ncase provided no guidance for deciding future cases that\\ninvolve predicate crimes other than attempted burglary,\\nparticularly those for which there are no clear analogs\\namong the enumerated crimes. Pointing out that problem\\nin dissent, I anticipated this very case: “Is, for example,\\ndriving under the influence of alcohol more analogous to\\nburglary, arson, extortion, or a crime involving use of\\nexplosives?” Id., at ____ (slip op., at 2).\\n   My dissent set out a different approach to the statute.\\nIn my view, the best way to interpret §924(e) is first to\\ndetermine which of the enumerated offenses poses the\\nleast serious risk of physical injury, and then to set that\\nlevel of risk as the “serious potential risk” required by the\\nstatute. Crimes that pose at least that serious a risk of\\ninjury are encompassed by the residual clause; crimes that\\ndo not are excluded. In my judgment, burglary was the\\nleast risky crime among the enumerated offenses, and I\\ntherefore concluded that attempted burglary, which is less\\nrisky than burglary, is not covered by the residual clause.\\n   The Court held otherwise in James, and since this is a\\nstatutory case that holding has a strong claim to stare\\ndecisis. But the concomitant of the sad fact that the the-\\nory of James has very limited application is the happy fact\\nthat its stare decisis effect is very limited as well. It must\\nbe followed, I presume, for unenumerated crimes that are\\nanalogous to enumerated crimes (e.g., attempted arson).\\nIt provides no answer, and suggests no approach to an\\nanswer, where, as here, the predicate crime has no analog\\namong the enumerated crimes. For such cases I would\\ntherefore adhere to the principles I set forth in my James\\ndissent.\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 553 U.

Confronted with a predi-\\ncate crime that has no obvious analog among the enumer-\\nated offenses, the Court engrafts a requirement onto the\\nresidual clause that a predicate crime involve “purposeful,\\n‘violent,’ and ‘aggressive’ conduct.” Ante, at 7. By doing\\nso, it excludes a slew of crimes from the scope of the resid-\\nual clause, including (not by happenstance) the crime at\\nissue here, drunk driving. Like James, this latest made-\\nfor-the-case improvisation does not (as my resolution does)\\nprovide a complete framework that will embrace all future\\ncases. There are still many crimes that are not analogous\\nto the enumerated crimes (so that their status cannot be\\nresolved by James) but do involve “purposeful, ‘violent,’\\nand ‘aggressive’ conduct” (so that their status cannot be\\nresolved by today’s deus ex machina). Presumably some\\nthird (and perhaps fourth and fifth) gimmick will be de-\\nvised to resolve those cases as they arise, leaving our\\nbrethren on the district courts and courts of appeals much\\nroom for enjoyable speculation.\\n   But quite apart from its regrettable continuation of a\\npiecemeal, suspenseful, Scrabble-like approach to the\\ninterpretation of this statute, the problem with the Court’s\\nholding today is that it is not remotely faithful to the\\nstatute that Congress wrote. There is simply no basis\\n(other than the necessity of resolving the present case) for\\nholding that the enumerated and unenumerated crimes\\nmust be similar in respects other than the degree of risk\\nthat they pose.\\n   The Court is correct that the clause “otherwise involves\\nconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical\\ninjury to another” signifies a similarity between the enu-\\nmerated and unenumerated crimes. It is not, however,\\nany old similarity, such as (to take a random example)\\n“purposeful, ‘violent,’ and ‘aggressive’ conduct.” Rather, it\\n\\x0c4                 BEGAY v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\\n\\nis the particular similarity specified after the “other-\\nwise”—i.e., that they all pose a serious potential risk of\\nphysical injury to another. They need not be similar in\\nany other way. As the Court correctly notes, the word\\n“otherwise” in this context means “ ‘in a different way or\\nmanner.’ ” Ante, at 6–7; see also James, 550 U. S., at ___\\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4); Webster’s New\\nInternational Dictionary 1729 (2d ed. 1957) (“in another\\nway or in other ways”). Therefore, by using the word\\n“otherwise” the writer draws a substantive connection\\nbetween two sets only on one specific dimension—i.e.,\\nwhatever follows “otherwise.” What that means here is\\nthat “committing one of the enumerated crimes . . . is one\\nway to commit a crime ‘involv[ing] a serious potential risk\\nof physical injury to another’; and that other ways of com-\\nmitting a crime of that character similarly constitute\\n‘violent felon[ies].’ ” James, supra, at ___ (SCALIA, J.,\\ndissenting) (slip op., at 5).\\n   The Court rejects this seemingly straightforward statu-\\ntory analysis, reading the residual clause to mean that the\\nunenumerated offenses must be similar to the enumerated\\noffenses not only in the degree of risk they pose, but also\\n“in kind,” despite the fact that “otherwise” means that the\\ncommon element of risk must be presented “ ‘in a different\\nway or manner.’ ” Ante, at 5–7 (emphasis added). The\\nCourt’s explanation for this interpretation seems to be\\nthat the enumerated crimes are “so far from clear in re-\\nspect to the degree of risk each poses that it is difficult to\\naccept clarification in respect to degree of risk as Con-\\ngress’s only reason for including them.” Ante, at 5. While\\nI certainly agree that the degree of risk associated with\\nthe enumerated crimes is unclear, I find it unthinkable\\nthat the solution to that problem is to write a different\\nstatute. The phrase “otherwise involves conduct that\\npresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\\nanother” limits inclusion in the statute only by a crime’s\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 553 U.

The use of the adjective “serious”\\nseems to me to signify a purely quantitative measure of\\nrisk. If both an intentional and a negligent crime pose a\\n50% risk of death, could one be characterized as involving\\na “serious risk” and the other not? Surely not.\\n   The Court supports its argument with that ever-ready\\nrefuge from the hardships of statutory text, the (judicially)\\nperceived statutory purpose. According to the Court,\\nbecause the Armed Career Criminal Act is concerned with\\n“the special danger created when a particular type of\\noffender—a violent criminal or drug trafficker—possesses\\na gun,” the statutory purpose favors applying §924(e)’s\\nenhanced penalty only to those criminals “who might\\ndeliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.” Ante, at\\n8–9. I cannot possibly infer that purpose from the statute.\\nFor all I know, the statute was meant to punish those who\\nare indifferent to human life, or who are undeterred by the\\ncriminal penalties attached to the commission of other\\ncrimes (after all, the statute enhances penalties for drug\\ntraffickers, see §924(e)(2)(A)). While the Court’s asserted\\npurpose would surely be a reasonable one, it has no more\\ngrounding in the statutory text than do these other possi-\\nbilities. And what is more, the Court’s posited purpose is\\npositively contradicted by the fact that one of the enumer-\\nated crimes—the unlawful use of explosives—may involve\\nmerely negligent or reckless conduct. See ALI, Model\\nPenal Code §220.2(2) (1985) (“A person is guilty of a mis-\\ndemeanor if he recklessly creates a risk of catastrophe in\\nthe employment of fire, explosives or other dangerous\\nmeans”); id., §220.3 (“A person is guilty of criminal mis-\\nchief if he . . . damages tangible property of another pur-\\nposely, recklessly, or by negligence in the employment of\\nfire, explosives, or other dangerous means”).\\n   The Court says that an interpretation of the residual\\nclause that includes all crimes posing a serious risk of\\n\\x0c6                 BEGAY v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\\n\\ninjury would render superfluous §924(e)(2)(B)(i), which\\nprovides that a “violent felony” is any crime that “has as\\nan element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of\\nphysical force against the person” of another. Ante, at 4\\n(internal quotation marks omitted). But the canon against\\nsurplusage has substantially less force when it comes to\\ninterpreting a broad residual clause like the one at issue\\nhere. Though the second clause renders the first superflu-\\nous, it would raise no eyebrows to refer to “crimes that\\nentail the use of force and crimes that, while not entailing\\nthe use of force, nonetheless present a serious risk of\\ninjury to another person.” In any event, the canon against\\nsurplusage merely helps decide between competing per-\\nmissible interpretations of an ambiguous statute; it does\\nnot sanction writing in a requirement that Congress ne-\\nglected to think of. And finally, come to think of it, the\\nCourt’s solution does nothing whatever to solve the sup-\\nposed surplusage problem. Crimes that include as an\\nelement “the use . . . of physical force against the person of\\nanother” are all embraced (and the reference to them thus\\nrendered superfluous) by the requirement of “purposeful,\\n‘violent,’ and ‘aggressive’ conduct” that the Court invents.\\n                              III\\n   Under my interpretation of §924(e), I must answer one\\nquestion: Does drunk driving pose at least as serious a\\nrisk of physical injury to another as burglary? From the\\nevidence presented by the Government, I cannot conclude\\nso. Because of that, the rule of lenity requires that I re-\\nsolve this case in favor of the defendant.\\n   The Government cites the fact that in 2006, 17,062\\npersons died from alcohol-related car crashes, and that\\n15,121 of those deaths involved drivers with blood-alcohol\\nconcentrations of 0.08 or higher. See Brief for United\\nStates 17. Drunk driving is surely a national problem of\\ngreat concern. But the fact that it kills many people each\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)             7\\n\\n                SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment\\n\\nyear tells us very little about whether a single act of drunk\\ndriving “involves conduct that presents a serious potential\\nrisk of physical injury to another.” It may well be that an\\neven greater number of deaths occurs annually to pedes-\\ntrians crossing the street; but that hardly means that\\ncrossing the street presents a serious potential risk of\\ninjury. Where the issue is “risk,” the annual number of\\ninjuries from an activity must be compared with the an-\\nnual incidents of the activity. Otherwise drunk driving\\ncould be said to pose a more serious risk of physical harm\\nthan murder. In addition, drunk driving is a combination\\nof two activities: (1) drinking and (2) driving. If driving\\nalone results in injury in a certain percentage of cases, it\\ncould hardly be said that the entirety of the risk posed by\\ndrunk driving can be attributed to the combination. And\\nfinally, injuries to the drunk drivers themselves must be\\nexcluded from the calculus, because the statute counts\\nonly injuries to other persons.\\n   Needless to say, we do not have these relevant statistics.\\nAnd even if we did, we would still need to know similar\\nstatistics for burglary, which are probably even harder to\\ncome by. This does not mean that I will never be able to\\nidentify a crime that falls under the residual clause. For\\nsome crimes, the severity of the risk will be obvious.\\nCrimes like negligent homicide, see ALI, Model Penal\\nCode §210.4 (1980), conspiracy to commit a violent crime,\\nid., §5.03 (1985), inciting to riot, 18 U. S. C. §2101, and the\\nproduction of chemical weapons, §229, certainly pose a\\nmore serious risk of physical injury to others than bur-\\nglary. (By contrast, the Court’s approach eliminates from\\nthe residual clause all negligent crimes, even those that\\nentail a 100% risk of physical injury such as negligent\\nhomicide.) But I can do no more than guess as to whether\\ndrunk driving poses a more serious risk than burglary,\\nand I will not condemn a man to a minimum of 15 years in\\nprison on the basis of such speculation.

S. C. §924(e)(2)(B), i.e., bur-\\nglary, extortion, arson, and crimes involving the use of\\nexplosives. These crimes, according to the Court, “all\\ntypically involve purposeful, ‘violent,’ and ‘aggressive’\\nconduct.” Ante, at 7 (quoting 470 F. 3d, at 980 (McCon-\\nnell, J., dissenting)).\\n   This interpretation cannot be squared with the text of\\nthe statute, which simply does not provide that an offense\\nmust be “purposeful,” “violent,” or “aggressive” in order to\\nfall within the residual clause. Rather, after listing bur-\\nglary, arson, extortion, and explosives offenses, the statute\\nprovides (in the residual clause) that an offense qualifies if\\nit “otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious\\npotential risk of physical injury to another.” Therefore,\\noffenses falling within the residual clause must be similar\\nto the named offenses in one respect only: They must,\\n“otherwise”—which is to say, “in a different manner,” 10\\nOED 984 (def. B(1)); see also Webster’s 1598—“involve[]\\nconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical\\ninjury to another.” Requiring that an offense must also be\\n“purposeful,” “violent,” or “aggressive” amounts to adding\\nnew elements to the statute, but we “ordinarily resist\\nreading words or elements into a statute that do not ap-\\npear on its face.” Bates v. United States, 522 U. S. 23, 29\\n(1997).\\n   Each part of this additional, judicially added require-\\nment presents other problems as well.\\n   Purposeful. At least one State’s DUI law requires proof\\nof purposeful conduct. See Tam v. State, 232 Ga. App. 15,\\n——————\\nDUI offense as a misdemeanor).\\n\\x0c6                 BEGAY v.

In addition, many States recognize invol-\\nuntary intoxication as a defense. See 4 R. Essen & R.\\nErwin, Defense of Drunk Driving Cases: Criminal—Civil\\n§44.04 (2007). And even in States that do not require\\npurposefulness, I have no doubt that the overwhelming\\nmajority of DUI defendants purposefully drank before\\ngetting behind the wheel and were purposefully operating\\ntheir vehicles at the time of apprehension. I suspect that\\nmany DUI statutes do not require proof of purposefulness\\nbecause the element is almost always present, requiring\\nproof of the element would introduce an unnecessary\\ncomplication, and it would make no sense to preclude\\nconviction of those defendants who were so drunk that\\nthey did not even realize that they were behind the wheel.\\n   Violent. It is clear that 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B) is not\\nlimited to “violent” crimes, for if it were, it would be re-\\ndundant. The prior subparagraph, §924(e)(2)(A), includes\\noffenses that have as an element the use or threatened use\\nof violence.\\n   Aggressive. The concept of “aggressive” crimes is vague,\\nand in any event, it is hardly apparent why DUI—not to\\nmention the species of felony DUI recidivism that resulted\\nin petitioner’s predicament—is not “aggressive.” Driving\\ncan certainly involve “aggressive” conduct. Indeed, some\\nStates have created the offense of “aggressive driving.”\\nSee M. Savage, M. Sundeen, & A.

The Court cites no empirical support for this\\nconclusion, and its accuracy is not self-evident. Peti-\\ntioner’s pattern of behavior may or may not be typical of\\nthose defendants who have enough DUI convictions to\\nqualify under N. M. Stat. Ann. §66–8–102(G) and 18\\nU. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B), but the example of his behavior in\\nthis case—pointing a gun at his aunt’s head and repeat-\\nedly pulling the trigger—should surely be enough to coun-\\nsel against uncritical reliance on stereotypes about “the\\ntype” of people who commit felony DUI violations.\\n    Defendants who qualify for an enhanced sentence under\\n§924(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. V) based (in whole or in part)\\non felony DUI convictions share at least three characteris-\\ntics that are relevant for present purposes. First, they are\\npersons who, in the judgment of Congress, cannot be\\ntrusted to use a firearm responsibly. In order to qualify\\nfor an enhanced sentence under §924(e), a defendant must\\nof course be convicted of violating the felon-in-possession\\nstatute, §922(g) (2000 ed.). The felon-in-possession statute\\nnecessarily rests on the judgment that a person with a\\nprior felony conviction cannot be trusted with a firearm.\\nSee Caron v. United States, 524 U. S. 308, 315 (1998)\\n(“Congress meant to keep guns away from all offenders\\nwho, the Federal Government feared, might cause harm\\n. . .”). And there is no dispute that a prior felony DUI\\nconviction qualifies as a felony under the felon-in-\\npossession law. If Congress thought that a person with a\\nprior felony DUI conviction is not “the kind of person” who\\nis likely to use a gun unlawfully, why would Congress\\nhave made it a crime for such a person to possess a gun?\\n    Second, defendants with DUI convictions that are\\ncounted under 18 U. S. C. §924(e)(2)(B) are likely to have\\n\\x0c8                 BEGAY v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                      ALITO, J., dissenting\\n\\nserious alcohol abuse problems. As previously mentioned,\\nordinary DUI convictions are generally not counted under\\n§924(e) because they are not punishable by imprisonment\\nfor more than a year. Such penalties are generally re-\\nserved for persons, like petitioner, with a record of re-\\npeated DUI violations. See National Conference of State\\nLegislatures, supra. Such individuals are very likely to\\nhave serious alcohol abuse problems and a propensity to\\nengage in irresponsible conduct while under the influence.\\nAlcohol use often precedes violent crimes, see, e.g., Roizen,\\nEpidemiological Issues in Alcohol-Related Violence, in 13\\nRecent Developments in Alcoholism 7, 8–9 (M. Galanter\\ned. 1997), and thus there is reason to worry about the\\nmisuse of firearms by defendants whose alcohol abuse\\nproblems are serious enough to result in felony DUI\\nconvictions.\\n   Third, defendants with DUI convictions that are\\ncounted under §924(e)(2)(B) have either (a) such serious\\nalcohol abuse problems that they have at least three prior\\nfelony DUI convictions or (b) both one or two felony DUI\\nconvictions and one or two offenses that fall under\\n§924(e)(2)(B)(i) (offenses that have “as an element the use,\\nattempted use, or threatened use of physical force”) or that\\nare specifically set out in §924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (burglary, arson,\\nextortion, or an explosives offense). Defendants with three\\nfelony DUI convictions are likely to be super–DUI-\\nrecidivists like petitioner. Defendants with a combination\\nof felony DUI and other qualifying convictions—for exam-\\nple, convictions for assault or burglary—are persons who,\\neven by the Court’s lights, could be classified as “the kind\\nof person who might deliberately point [a] gun and pull\\nthe trigger.”\\n   Unlike the Court, I cannot say that persons with these\\ncharacteristics are less likely to use a gun illegally than\\nare persons convicted of other qualifying felonies.\\n   JUSTICE SCALIA’s concurrence takes a different ap-\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 553 U.

JUSTICE\\nSCALIA would hold (a) that an offense does not fall within\\nthe residual clause unless it presents a risk that is at least\\nas great as that presented by the least dangerous of the\\nenumerated offenses; (b) that burglary is the least danger-\\nous of the enumerated offenses; (c) that the relevant\\nmeasure of risk is the risk that the typical burglary, DUI,\\netc. would result in injury; and (d) that the risk presented\\nby an incident of DUI is less than the risk presented by a\\nburglary.\\n   JUSTICE SCALIA, like the Court, does not follow the\\nstatutory language. The statute says that offenses falling\\nwithin the residual clause must present “a serious poten-\\ntial risk of physical injury to another.” The statute does\\nnot say that these offenses must present at least as much\\nrisk as the enumerated offenses.\\n   The statute also does not say, as JUSTICE SCALIA would\\nhold, that the relevant risk is the risk that each incident of\\nDUI will result in injury. I see no basis for concluding\\nthat Congress was not also concerned with the risk faced\\nby potential victims, particularly since the statute explic-\\nitly refers to “potential risk.” Drunk driving is regarded as\\na severe societal problem in large measure because of the\\nvery large number of victims it produces each year.\\n   Finally, JUSTICE SCALIA’s conclusion that burglary is the\\nleast risky of the enumerated offenses is based on a pro-\\ncrustean reading of §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). This provision refers,\\nwithout qualification, to “extortion.” In his dissent in\\nJames v. United States, 550 U. S. ___ (2007), JUSTICE\\nSCALIA concluded that many forms of extortion are “inher-\\nently unlikely to cause physical harm.” Id., at ___ (slip op.,\\nat 10) (emphasis in original). Only by finding that the\\nterm “extortion” in §924(e)(2)(B)(ii) really means only\\ncertain forms of extortion was JUSTICE SCALIA able to\\ncome to the conclusion that burglary is the least risky of\\nthe enumerated offenses.\\n\\x0c10               BEGAY v.

Browning, Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\\nMr. Charles F. Barber, Washington, D.C., for respondent.\\nMr. Justice FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n\\n\\n1\\nOnce more it becomes necessary to determine 'What Congress has made the allowable unit of prosecution,' United States v. Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp., 344 U.S. 218, 221, 73 S.Ct. 227, 229, 97 L.Ed. 260, under a statute which does not explicitly give the answer. This recurring problem now arises under what is familiarly known as the Mann Act. The relevant provisions of the Act in its present form are:\\n\\n\\n2\\n'Whoever knowingly transports in interstate or foreign      commerce * * * any woman or girl for the purpose of      prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose.      * * *\\n\\n\\n3\\n'Shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more      than five years, or both.' § 2 of the Act of June 25, 1910,      36 Stat. 825, 18 U.S.C. § 2421, 18 U.S.C.A. § 2421.\\n\\n\\n4\\nThe facts need not detain us long. Petitioner pleaded guilty to violations laid in two counts, each referring to a different woman. Concededly, the petitioner transported the two women on the same trip and in the same vehicle. This was the basis of his claim that he committed only a single offense and could not be subjected to cumulative punishment under the two counts. The District Court rejected this conception of the statute and sentenced the petitioner to consecutive terms of two years and six months on each of the two counts. On appeal from denial of a motion to correct the sentence, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court. 'While the act of transportation was a single one,' it ruled, 'the unlawful purpose must of necessity have been selective and personal as to each of the women involved. * * * We therefore believe that two separate offenses were committed in this case.' 213 F.2d 629, 630. This decision was in accord with decisions of other lower federal courts, but a contrary holding by the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, in Robinson v. United States, 143 F.2d 276, raised a square conflict for settlement by this Court. This led us to bring the case here. 348 U.S. 895, 75 S.Ct. 223.\\n\\n\\n5\\nThe punishment appropriate for the diverse federal offenses is a matter for the discretion of Congress, subject only to constitutional limitations, more particularly the Eighth Amendment. Congress could no doubt make the simultaneous transportation of more than one woman in violation of the Mann Act liable to cumulative punishment for each woman so transported. The question is: did it do so? It has not done so in words in the provisions defining the crime and fixing its punishment. Nor is guiding light afforded by the statute in its entirety or by any controlling gloss. The constitutional basis of the statute is the withdrawal of 'the facility of interstate transportation', Hoke v. United States, 227 U.S. 308, 322, 33 S.Ct. 281, 284, 57 L.Ed. 523, though, to be sure, the power was exercised in aid of social morality. Again, it will not promote guiding analysis to indulge in what might be called the color-matching of prior decisions concerned with 'the unit of prosecution' in order to determine how near to, or how far from, the problem under this statute the answers are that have been given under other statutes.\\n\\n\\n6\\nIt is not to be denied that argumentative skill, as was shown at the Bar, could persuasively and not unreasonably reach either of the conflicting constructions. About only one aspect of the problem can one be dogmatic. When Congress has the will it has no difficulty in expressing it—when it has the will, that is, of defining what it desires to make the unit of prosecution and, more particularly, to make each stick in a faggot a single criminal unit. When Congress leaves to the Judiciary the task of imputing to Congress an undeclared will, the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of lenity. And this not out of any sentimental consideration, or for want of sympathy with the purpose of Congress in proscribing evil or anti-social conduct. It may fairly be said to be a presupposition of our law to resolve doubts in the enforcement of a penal code against the imposition of a harsher punishment. This in no wise implies that language used in criminal statutes should not be read with the saving grace of common sense with which other enactments, not cast in technical language, are to be read. Nor does it assume that offenders against the law carefully read the penal code before they embark on crime. It merely means that if Congress does not fix the punishment for a federal offense clearly and without ambiguity, doubt will be resolved against turning a single transaction into multiple offenses, when we have no more to go on than the present case furnishes.\\n\\n\\n7\\nReversed.\\n\\n\\n8\\nMr. Justice MINTON, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice REED join, dissenting.\\n\\n\\n9\\nThe statute does not seem ambiguous to me. Congress made it clear enough for me to understand that it was trying to help the States as far as it could to stamp out the degradation and debauchery of women by punishing those who engaged in using them for prostitution. The only way Congress could do that was to make it unlawful to use the channels of commerce to transport them. The statute provides that,\\n\\n\\n10\\n'Whoever knowingly transports in interstate * * * commerce *      * * any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution. * * *\\n\\n\\n11\\n'Shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more      than five years, or both.'\\n\\n\\n12\\nTo me the statute means that to transport one or more women or girls in commerce constitutes a separate offense as to each one. Congress had as its purpose the protection of the individual woman or girl from exploitation, and the transportation of each female was to be punished. It was not concerned with protection of the means of transportation. Surely it did not intend to make it easier if one transported females by the bus load. A construction of the statute that reaches that result does violence to its plain wording. That is what the District Court thought, that is what the Court of Appeals thought, and with that I agree, and would affirm.\\n\\n\"}]\n",

The District Court held that petitioner had been properly sentenced, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.\\nHeld:  Section 406 of the Act does not authorize the imposition of a special parole term even though that sanction is included within the penalty provision of the target offense.  Pp. 387-401.\\n(a) A \"plain meaning\" interpretation of the term \"imprisonment\" in § 406 does not support the position that the term means a term of incarceration plus special parole made applicable by the target offense\\'s penalty provisions.  Moreover, the structure of the Act read as a whole supports the conclusion that § 406 defines the types of punishment authorized for conspirators—imprisonment, fine, or both—and sets maximum limits on those sanctions through reference to the penalty provisions of the target offense, but does not incorporate by reference any provisions for special parole.  Pp. 388-390.\\n(b) Nor does the Act\\'s legislative history demonstrate that Congress intended that the penalties authorized for substantive offenses, and those for conspiracies to commit them, were to be identical, thus authorizing special parole terms for conspiracy convictions.  Instead, the history supports the view that § 406 authorizes two types of sanctions—fines and imprisonment—and fixes the maximum amount of each that may be imposed by reference to the target offense\\'s penalty provisions.  Pp. 391-398.\\n(c) A reading of § 406 to include the special parole provisions of target offenses cannot be supported on the ground that Congress\\' principal objective in enacting the Act\\'s penalty provisions—to deter professional criminals from engaging in drug trafficking for profit—renders it unreasonable to ascribe to Congress the intent to authorize special parole for isolated substantive offenses while withholding this sentencing tool for conspiracies.  A comparison of those drug offenses for which Congress clearly authorized special parole terms with those for which it clearly did not, does not reveal a coherent pattern based on the asserted justification for escalated sanctions.  Moreover, since § 406 deals with both conspiracies and attempts, and prescribes an identical range of punishment for both, it is not surprising that Congress would provide for less stringent sanctions to be imposed for violations of § 406 than for a completed substantive offense.  P. 398-399.\\n600 F.2d 407, reversed and remanded.\\nSteven Lloyd Barrett, New York City, for petitioner.\\nHarlon L. Dalton, New York City, for respondent.\\nMr. Justice BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n\\n\\n1\\nThe issue presented in this case is whether § 406 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (Act), 84 Stat. 1265, 21 U.S.C. § 846,1 authorizes a sentencing court to impose a term of special parole upon a defendant who is convicted of conspiracy to manufacture or distribute a controlled substance.\\n\\n\\n2\\n* Section 406 provides:\\n\\n\\n3\\n\"Any person who attempts or conspires to commit any      offense defined in this title is punishable by imprisonment      or fine or both which may not exceed the maximum punishment      prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the      object of the attempt or conspiracy.\\n\\n\\n4\\nThe object of the conspiracy at issue in this case was the commission of the substantive offense defined in § 401(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 841(a).  That subsection reads:\\n\\n\\n5\\n\"Except as authorized by this title, it shall be      unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally—\\n\\n\\n6\\n\"(1) to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess      with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a      controlled substance;  or\\n\\n\\n7\\n\"(2) to create, distribute, or dispense, or possess with      intent to distribute or dispense, a counterfeit substance.\"\\n\\n\\n8\\nThe penalties for violations of § 401(a) are set forth in § 401(b).  That subsection authorizes the imposition of terms of imprisonment, fines, and, in some instances, mandatory minimum terms of special parole.  The range of permissible punishments varies depending on the nature of the controlled substance involved, and on whether the defendant has been convicted previously of a drug offense.  The penalty provision at issue is § 401(b)(1)(B).2  It states:\\n\\n\\n9\\n\"Except as otherwise provided in section 405 [which deals with distribution to minors], any person who violates      subsection (a) of this section shall be sentenced as follows:\\n\\n\\n10\\n*          *          *          *          *\\n\\n\\n11\\n\"In the case of a controlled substance in schedule I or      II which is not a narcotic drug or in the case of any      controlled substance in schedule III, such person shall be      sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not more than 5 years,      a fine or not more than $15,000, or both.  If any person      commits such a violation after one or more prior convictions      of him for an offense punishable under this paragraph, or for      a felony under any other provision of this title or title III      or other law of the United States relating to narcotic drugs,      marihuana, or depressant or stimulant substances, have become      final, such person shall be sentenced to a term of      imprisonment of not more than 10 years, a fine of not more      than $30,000, or both.  Any sentence imposing a term of      imprisonment under this paragraph shall, in the absence of      such a prior conviction, impose a special parole term of at      least 2 years in addition to such term of imprisonment and      shall, if there was such a prior conviction, impose a special      parole term of at least 4 years in addition to such term of      imprisonment.\"\\n\\n\\n12\\nSection 401(c) describes the operation of the special parole term provisions in greater detail.  It states:\\n\\n\\n13\\n\"A special parole term imposed under this section or      section 405 may be revoked if its terms and conditions are      violated.  In such circumstances the original term of      imprisonment shall be increased by the period of the special      parole term and the resulting new term of imprisonment shall      not be diminished by the time which was spent on special      parole.  A person whose special parole term has been revoked may be required to serve all or part of      the remainder of the new term of imprisonment.  A special      parole term provided for in this section or section 405 shall      be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other parole      provided for by law.\"\\n\\n\\n14\\nThe narrow, but important, question presented in this case is whether § 406, which states the penalty for conspiracy as \"imprisonment or fine or both,\" but limits maximum punishment by reference to the penalty provisions of the substantive target offense, authorizes the imposition of a special parole term where that sanction is included within the penalty provisions of the target offense.\\n\\nII\\n\\n15\\nIn an indictment filed in December 1976 with the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, petitioner Alphonse Bifulco and others were charged with a single count of conspiring to violate § 401(a)(1) by knowingly and intentionally manufacturing, distributing, and possessing substantial quantities of phencyclidine, a schedule III controlled substance.  This conspiracy was charged as a violation of § 406. A jury found petitioner and several codefendants guilty of the offense charged, and petitioner was sentenced to a 4-year term of imprisonment, a fine of $1,000, and a 5-year special parole term.3 The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit subsequently affirmed petitioner\\'s conviction in an unpublished order.\\n\\n\\n16\\nIn January 1979, petitioner, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255, filed pro se a motion to vacate his sentence.  He claimed that the sentence was unlawful because § 406 does not authorize the imposition of a special parole term to be served upon completion of a term of imprisonment.  The District Court held that petitioner had been properly sentenced, and dismissed his complaint.  App. 7.\\n\\n\\n17\\nOn appeal, the Second Circuit affirmed.  600 F.2d 407 (1979). In a per curiam opinion, that court followed two other Courts of Appeals that had held that § 406 authorizes the imposition of a special parole term.  See United States v. Burman, 584 F.2d 1354, 1356-1358 (CA4 1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1118, 99 S.Ct. 1026, 59 L.Ed.2d 77 (1979), and United States v. Jacobson, 578 F.2d 863, 867-868 (CA10), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 932, 99 S.Ct. 324, 58 L.Ed.2d 327 (1978).  It also relied on the decision in United States v. Dankert, 507 F.2d 190 (CA5 1975), which reached a similar result with respect to the closely analogous sentencing provisions of § 1013 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 963 (proscribing any conspiracy to import a controlled substance).\\n\\n\\n18\\nShortly after the Second Circuit\\'s decision in this case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reached the opposite conclusion on the issue and held that a special parole term may not be imposed under § 406.   United States v. Mearns, 599 F.2d 1296 (3rd Cir. 1979), aff\\'g 461 F.Supp. 641 (Del.1978) cert. pending, No. 79-415.  We granted certiorari, 444 U.S. 897, 100 S.Ct. 205, 62 L.Ed.2d 133 (1979), to resolve this conflict among the Courts of Appeals.4\\n\\nIII\\n\\n19\\nThe Government recognizes, Brief for United States 31, n. 26, that our examination of the meaning of § 406 must be informed by the policy that the Court has expressed as \"the rule of lenity.\" In past cases the Court has made it clear that this principle of statutory construction applies not only to interpretations of the substantive ambit of criminal prohibitions, but also to the penalties they impose.  See, e. g., United States v. Batchelder, 442 U.S. 114, 121, 99 S.Ct. 2198, 2202, 60 L.Ed.2d 755 (1979); Simpson v. United States, 435 U.S. 6, 14-15, 98 S.Ct. 909, 913-914, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978).  The Court\\'s opinion in Ladner v. United States, 358 U.S. 169, 178, 79 S.Ct. 209, 214, 3 L.Ed.2d 199 (1958), states the rule:  \"This policy of lenity means that the Court will not interpret a federal criminal statute so as to increase the penalty that it places on an individual when such an interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what Congress intended.\"  See Whalen v. United States, 445 U.S. 684, 695, n. 10, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1440,n. 10, 63 L.Ed.2d 715, n. 10 (1980);  Simpson v. United States, 435 U.S., at 15, 98 S.Ct., at 914.\\n\\n\\n20\\nThe Court has emphasized that the \"touchstone\" of the rule of lenity \"is statutory ambiguity.\"  See, e. g., Lewis v. United States, 445 U.S. 55, 65, 100 S.Ct. 915, 921, 63 L.Ed.2d 198 (1980).  Where Congress has manifested its intention, we may not manufacture ambiguity in order to defeat that intent.  The Government argues here that there can be no uncertainty about Congress\\' intent to authorize a special parole term as a penalty for a conspiracy offense, whenever that penalty is authorized for the offense that was the target of the conspiracy.  In advancing this argument, it focuses on the language and structure, legislative history, and motivating policies of the Act.  We examine these three factors in turn.\\n\\n\\n21\\n* Language and structure of the Act.  Several reviewing courts have adopted the view that the special parole term specified in § 401(b)(1)(B) is necessarily included within the \"term of imprisonment\" to which it is appended.  See, e. g., United States v. Jacobson, 578 F.2d, at 868.  Thus, when Congress stated in § 406 that a person guilty of attempt or conspiracy \"is punishable by imprisonment,\" it meant to include within the term \"imprisonment\" any special parole term made applicable by the penalty provisions of the substantive offense.  This argument is not too persuasive, however, because special parole is not authorized for all substantive offenses to which § 406 refers. Therefore, \"imprisonment\" within the meaning of § 406 does not always include special parole.  As a period of supervision served upon completion of a prison term, special parole is also functionally distinct from incarceration.  Finally, the penalty provisions of those substantive offenses that authorize special parole terms reflect this functional dichotomy.  Section 401(b)(1)(B), for example, twice provides that a special parole term of years is to be imposed \"in addition to such term of imprisonment.\"  (Emphasis added.)  We agree, therefore, with the conclusion of those courts that have rejected the argument that \"imprisonment\" in § 406 plainly means a term of incarceration plus special parole.  See, e. g., United States v. Jacquinto, 464 F.Supp. 728, 729-730 (ED Pa.1979).\\n\\n\\n22\\nFaced with these obstacles, the Government cannot rely solely on a \"plain meaning\" interpretation of the term \"imprisonment.\" Thus, in its principal argument, the Government asks this Court to take a broader view of the relationship between § 406 and the penalty provisions for substantive offenses and to conclude that the structure of the Act, viewed as a whole, creates an inference that § 406 incorporates by reference those substantive penalty provisions.  The Government contends that the language of the statute supports this reading because § 406 authorizes penalties \"which may not exceed the maximum punishment prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.\"  While this argument is not wholly without force, it ignores the immediately preceding words of § 406, which state that \"[a]ny person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this title is punishable by imprisonment or fine or both.\"  (Emphasis added.)5  Petitioner argues that § 406 defines the types of punishment authorized for conspirators—imprisonment, fine, or both—and sets maximum limits on those sanctions through reference to the penalty provisions of the target offense.  Petitioner\\'s reading of the language of § 406, and the sentencing scheme that it proposes, is no less plausible than the Government\\'s.  Moreover, it is petitioner\\'s reading that finds further support in the structure of the Act read as a whole.\\n\\n\\n23\\nSection 406 is not the only provision of the Act that defines sentences by reference to the penalty provisions of other offenses.  Section 405(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 845(a), which enhances punishment for one convicted of distributing a controlled substance to a minor, provides:\\n\\n\\n24\\n\"Any person at least eighteen years of age who violates      section 401(a)(1) by distributing a controlled substance to a      person under twenty-one years of age is  . . .  punishable by      (1) a term of imprisonment, or a fine, or both, up to twice      that authorized by section 401(b), and (2) at least twice any      special parole term authorized by section 401(b), for a first      offense involving the same controlled substance and      schedule.\"  (Emphasis supplied.)6\\n\\n\\n25\\nAt the least, Congress\\' separate enumeration of intended penalties in § 405 confirms its design to adhere to the functional distinction between \"imprisonment, or a fine, or both\" and the unique and novel concept of special parole.  That no reference is made to special parole in § 406 thus supports petitioner\\'s view that Congress did not intend it to constitute an element of the sentence imposed upon one convicted of conspiracy or attempt.7\\n\\n\\n26\\nFurther proof that Congress intended special parole to be imposed only for certain substantive offenses defined in § 401 and § 405, and not for other offenses under the Act, is found in § 401(c), which defines the workings of special parole.  That subsection states:  \"A special parole term imposed under this section or section 405 may be revoked if its terms and conditions are violated.\"  (Emphasis supplied.)  One convicted and sentenced for conspiracy under § 406 cannot be said to have had his sentence \"imposed under\" § 401 or § 405.8\\n\\nB\\n\\n27\\nLegislative history.  Conceding that Congress\\' draftsmanship when it enacted § 406 may have been less than \"explicit,\" Brief for United States 17, and n. 10, the Government asks this Court to look beyond the ambiguous language of the statute, and to give its words \"their fair meaning in accord with the manifest intent of the lawmakers.\"  United States v. Brown, 333 U.S. 18, 26, 68 S.Ct. 376, 380, 92 L.Ed. 442 (1948).  The Government argues that the legislative history of the Act demonstrates that Congress intended that the penalties authorized for substantive offenses, and those for conspiracies to commit them, were to be identical.\\n\\n\\n28\\nIt is true that prior to the Act federal narcotics legislation provided for a congruence between sentences authorized for substantive violations and sentences authorized for conspiracies.9  A similar congruence was a feature of the several bills introduced in Congress in 1969 that were the forerunners of the Act.  But a special parole term, a sanction previously unknown in the administration of our system of criminal justice, was not authorized as a penalty for any offense in those initial proposals.10\\n\\n\\n29\\nThe special parole concept first was presented to Congress by John Ingersoll, Director of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, in testimony before a Senate Subcommittee on October 20, 1969.  See Narcotics Legislation:  Hearings on S. 1895 et al. before the Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., 663, 676 (1969).  The Attorney General earlier had sought Subcommittee approval for further input from the Justice Department on the penalty structures in the pending legislation, id., at 255, and Mr. Ingersoll presented several alternative penalty schemes for the Subcommittee\\'s consideration.11  His comments to the Subcommittee concerning the special parole provisions were, in their entirety, as follows:\\n\\n\\n30\\n\"Another requirement that has been included in the      alternative penalty schemes is a special parole term that is      a part of the illicit trafficking sentence structure.  Just      as incarceration is not always a meaningful answer to      effective rehabilitation, certainly incarceration without an      adequate supervisory followup after release is not in the      best interest of society.\\n\\n\\n31\\n\"Therefore, we have required a special parole term so      that persons sentenced for trafficking violations would be      placed under supervision for a period of time regardless of      whether they are incarcerated or their sentence probated or      suspended.  The intent here is to give the judges another      tool for sentencing and another means of protecting society      when dealing with the drug violator.\"  Id., at 676.\\n\\n\\n32\\nMr. Ingersoll did not specify whether special parole terms were to be authorized for conspiracies to commit trafficking offenses, see n. 11, supra, and the bill that eventually was approved by the full Senate Committee on the Judiciary was no less ambiguous.  See S.Rep. No. 91-613, pp. 116-118 (1969).  That bill, S. 3246, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970), in its §§ 501(c)(1) and (2), mandated the imposition of a special parole term whenever a prison sentence was imposed under the forerunners to §§ 401(b)(1)(A) and (B).12  But § 504 of the bill, the forerunner to § 406, included no reference to special parole.13\\n\\n\\n33\\nThe Judiciary Committee\\'s section-by-section analysis of S. 3246 noted that special parole terms were to be imposed for certain substantive offenses, S.Rep. No. 91-613, at 25, but with respect to the \"endeavor and conspiracy\" provision stated only: \"Section 504 provides that any person who endeavors or conspires to commit any offense defined in this title may be punished by imprisonment and/or a fine, which may not exceed the maximum punishment prescribed for the offense.\"  Id., at 26.  The Government argues that the Subcommittee meant to include a specific reference to special parole in § 504 when it amended the substantive offense sections in response to Mr. Ingersoll\\'s testimony.  For unexplained reasons, however, the Subcommittee neglected to make the conforming change in the conspiracy section.  Brief for United States 22. The wording of the Judiciary Committee\\'s section-by-section analysis, however, would seem to indicate its awareness that § 504, unlike the subsections of § 501 that had been amended to incorporate the concept of special parole, authorized punishments consisting only of \"imprisonment and/or a fine.\"\\n\\n\\n34\\nFurther support for the view that the Judiciary Committee knew what it was doing when it approved § 504 of S. 3246 may be found in those provisions of the bill that dealt with a second or subsequent offense.  Under the Act, doubly enhanced penalties for second offenders are included within the provisions defining the sentences for individual substantive offenses.  See, e. g., § 401(b)(1)(B), quoted, supra, at 383-384. S. 3246, however, contained a separate provision, § 508(a), that set out the penalties for repeat offenders.  It stated:\\n\\n\\n35\\n\"Any person convicted of any offense under this Act is,      if the offense is a second or subsequent offense, punishable      by a term of imprisonment twice that authorized, by twice the      fine otherwise authorized, or by both.  If the conviction is      for an offense punishable under subsection 501(c)(1) or      subsection 501(c)(2) of this Act [the forerunners to §§      401(b)(1)(A) and (B)], and if it is the offender\\'s second or      subsequent offense, the court shall impose, in addition to      any terms of imprisonment and fine, twice the special parole      term otherwise authorized.\"  S.Rep. No. 91-613, at 119-120.14\\n\\n\\n36\\nWe think this section of the Senate bill makes it fairly evident that the Committee recognized that it had provided for the imposition of special parole terms under various subsections of § 501, but that it had not done so generally.15  Thus, § 508(a) of S. 3246, like § 405 of the Act, reveals that Congress\\' failure explicitly to incorporate the concept of special parole into the Act\\'s conspiracy provision, alleged by the Government to have been inadvertent, in fact may have been intentional.\\n\\n\\n37\\nThe only reference made to the special parole provisions during the Senate debates on S. 3246 tends to confirm this conclusion.  Senator Dodd, the Subcommittee chairman, summarized the sentencing provisions of §§ 501(c)(1) and (2) as follows:\\n\\n\\n38\\n\"Those selling schedule I and II narcotics such as heroin and      opium can draw a sentence of up to 12 years and a possible      fine of $25,000.  For schedules I, II, and III sales of      non-narcotics such as marihuana, \\'pep pills\\' and the like,      the sentence is up to 5 years and a possible fine not      exceeding $15,000.  A [minimum] special parole term of from 2      to 3 years is required for each of the above offenses.\"  116      Cong.Rec. 996 (1970).\\n\\n\\n39\\nSenator Dodd did not mention the special parole concept in the context of any other sentencing provisions;  § 504, the conspiracy provision of S. 3246, was not mentioned at all during the Senate debates.\\n\\n\\n40\\nGiven the scant support in the legislative history of the Senate bill for the Government\\'s position, it is not surprising that the Government must place greater reliance on events that transpired during the House\\'s consideration of proposed narcotics legislation similar to S. 3246.  H.R. 17463, the subject of hearings before the House Committee on Ways and Means in July 1970, contained penalty provisions that were substantially identical to those in S. 3246.  See H.R. 17463, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., §§ 501(c)(1), (c)(2), and 504 (1970), reprinted in Ways and Means Hearings 61, 66.\\n\\n\\n41\\nMr. Ingersoll appeared before the Committee on Ways and Means, testified as to the Department of Justice\\'s firm support for H.R. 17463, and submitted a section-by-section analysis of the bill which highlighted the differences between its provisions and existing federal narcotics legislation.  Ways and Means Hearings 210-211.  That analysis described the operation of the special parole terms applicable to § 501(c), and noted:  \"This special parole term is a new program, and there are no comparable laws now in force for narcotic drug law convictions.\"  Id., at 222.  With respect to the bill\\'s conspiracy provision, § 504, Mr. Ingersoll\\'s section-by-section analysis stated:\\n\\n\\n42\\n\"This section provides that a person may be punished for      endeavoring or conspiring to commit an offense under this      Act.  Upon conviction, his sentence may not exceed the      punishment prescribed for the offense which was the object of      the attempt or the conspiracy.\"  Id., at 223.\\n\\n\\n43\\nThe Government would read the second sentence of this passage as explaining \"that the sentencing scheme contemplated that conspiracy was to be punished to the same extent as object offenses, without exception.\"  Brief for United States 24.  But the Ingersoll statement, like the language enacted in § 406, explains merely that the punishment imposed for conspiracy may not exceed the punishment authorized for the pertinent target offense. It does not define the punishment authorized under the conspiracy provision to include special parole, and it does not disavow petitioner\\'s theory that § 406 defines the types of punishment authorized for conspiracy, while the penalty provisions of the target offense set the maximum amounts of those types of punishment that properly may be imposed.  Moreover, a chart submitted to the Committee by the Justice Department, and appended to Mr. Ingersoll\\'s section-by-section analysis, specifically noted that H.R. 17463 authorized the imposition of special parole terms for certain substantive offenses.  Ways and Means Hearings 229. With respect to the conspiracy section of the bill, however, the chart contained a footnote that merely reads:  \"H.R. 17463 provides that any person who endeavors or conspires to commit any offense under the act may be punished by imprisonment and/or fine, which may not exceed the maximum punishment proscribed [sic ] for committing the offense.\"  Id., at 230, n. 6.  (Emphasis supplied.) In sum, we find no persuasive support for the Government\\'s argument in the report of the hearings before the House Committee on Ways and Means.\\n\\n\\n44\\nThe hearings before the Committee on Ways and Means followed earlier hearings conducted by the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce.  The latter Committee issued the House Report on H.R. 18583, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970), which contained additions and revisions to H.R. 17463 not pertinent to the sentencing provisions at issue here, H.R.Rep. No. 91-1444, pt. 1 (1970), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1970, p. 4566.  Like the Senate Report, the House Report appears plainly to recognize the distinction between the penalties for specific substantive offenses, authorizing special parole terms, and the conspiracy offense, authorizing only terms of imprisonment and fines.  Thus, with respect to § 406 of H.R. 18583, the direct ancestor of the present § 406, the House Report\\'s section-by-section analysis states:\\n\\n\\n45\\n\"Section 406 provides that any person who attempts or      conspires to commit any offense defined in this title may be      punished by imprisonment and/or fine which may not exceed the      maximum amount set for the offense, the commission of which      was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.\"      H.R.Rep.No.91-1444, at 50, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1970,      p. 4617.  (Emphasis supplied.) The grammatical structure of this sentence lends obvious support to petitioner\\'s theory that § 406 authorizes two types of sanctions—fines and imprisonment—and fixes the maximum amount of each that may be imposed by reference to the penalty provisions of the target offense.\\n\\n\\n46\\nIn conclusion, we believe that, rather than supporting the Government\\'s argument that Congress manifested an intention to authorize special parole terms for conspiracy convictions, the Act\\'s legislative history supports the opposite view.  In hearings, debates, and legislative reports, to the extent that Congress\\' attention was drawn to the matter, Members of both Houses explicitly recognized that the penalty provisions of some substantive offenses attached a mandatory minimum term of special parole to any term of imprisonment.  On the other hand, every reference to one of the forerunners of § 406 stated that it authorized penalties consisting of imprisonment and/or fine, and failed to mention special parole.\\n\\nC\\n\\n47\\nMotivating policy.  The Government strongly argues, finally, that Congress\\' principal objective in enacting the penalty provisions of the Act—to deter professional criminals from engaging in drug trafficking for profit—\"render[s] it unreasonable to ascribe to [Congress] the intent to authorize special parole for isolated substantive offenses while withholding this major sentencing tool for conspiracy offenses.\"  Brief for United States 28.  This contention is unpersuasive for two reasons.\\n\\n\\n48\\nFirst, as petitioner points out, Brief for Petitioner 14-23; Reply Brief for Petitioner 1-3, a comparison of those drug offenses for which Congress clearly authorized the imposition of special parole terms with those for which it clearly did not, does not reveal a coherent pattern based on the asserted justification for escalated sanctions.  For some of the most serious offenses, as measured by the length of the term of imprisonment and severity of the fine they authorize, special parole is not included among the available sanctions.  E. g., § 408 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 848 (continuing criminal enterprise); § 403 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 843 (registrants);  and the new § 401(d) of this Act, 21 U.S.C. § 841(d) (1976 ed., Supp. II) (piperidine offenses).  Thus, the Government\\'s argument based on Congress\\' sentencing objectives would prove too much.\\n\\n\\n49\\nSecond, the thrust of the Government\\'s argument is that the conspiracy to engage in drug trafficking presents at least as great a threat, if not a greater one, to the community as does an isolated act of distribution.  In other contexts, we have recognized the logic of that view.  See, e. g., Iannelli v. United States, 420 U. S. 770, 778, 95 S.Ct. 1284, 1290, 43 L.Ed.2d 616 (1975).  From this premise, the Government contends that Congress must have desired the harsh sanctions incorporated within the concept of special parole—the unlimited maximum length of its term and the grave consequences attending its revocation, see § 401(c) to be available to the judge sentencing a drug conspirator.\\n\\n\\n50\\nWhat the Government does not mention, however, is that § 406 sets identical penalties for conspiracies and for attempts. Congress dealt with both these forms of inchoate crime in a single provision, and prescribed an identical range of punishment for a person convicted of participation in a major trafficking conspiracy, and for another person convicted of an unsuccessful attempt to manufacture or distribute a small amount of a controlled substance.  When one focuses on the fact that § 406 penalizes attempts as well as conspiracies, it is not surprising that Congress would provide for less stringent sanctions to be imposed for violations of that provision than for a completed substantive offense.  Indeed, as Mr. Ingersoll pointed out in his section-by-section analysis of H.R. 17463, prior to the passage of this Act an attempt to commit a substantive drug offense was not punishable at all under the federal narcotics laws.  Ways and Means Hearings 223.16\\n\\nIV\\n\\n51\\nThis investigation into the meaning of § 406, as informed by an examination of its language and structure, its history, and relevant policy considerations, yields the likely conclusion that Congress\\' failure specifically to authorize the imposition of special parole terms as punishment for those convicted of conspiracy was not a slip of the legislative pen, nor the result of inartful draftsmanship, but was a conscious and not irrational legislative choice.  Our analysis reveals, at the least, a complete absence of an unambiguous legislative decision to authorize special parole terms as punishment for those convicted of drug conspiracies.  Of course, to the extent that doubts remain, they must be resolved in accord with the rule of lenity.17 If our construction of Congress\\' intent, as evidenced by the scant record it left behind, clashes with present legislative expectations, there is a simple remedy—the insertion of a brief appropriate phrase, by amendment, into the present language of § 406.  But it is for Congress, and not this Court, to enact the words that will produce the result the Government seeks in this case.\\n\\n\\n52\\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court with instructions to vacate the special parole term that was imposed upon petitioner.\\n\\n\\n53\\nIt is so ordered.\\n\\n\\n54\\nMr. Chief Justice BURGER, concurring.\\n\\n\\n55\\nIf the question presented by this case were as simple and easy as the dissent formulates it—whether \"the directors of a narcotics distribution business [should] be punished less severely than their subordinates who merely peddle the poison\"—none of us would have any difficulty with the decision.  But that is not really the issue.  Rather, the question before the Court is substantially more limited:  What do the words of the statute mean?  Of course, we must try to discern the intent of Congress. But we perform that task by beginning with the ordinary meaning of the language of the statute.  Our compass is not to read a statute to reach what we perceive—or even what we think a reasonable person should perceive—is a \"sensible result\";  Congress must be taken at its word unless we are to assume the role of statute revisers.  Aaron v. SEC, 446 U.S. 680, 100 S.Ct. 1945, 64 L.Ed.2d 611 (1980);  TVA v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 173, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 2291, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978).\\n\\n\\n56\\nParticularly in the administration of criminal justice, a badly drawn statute places strains on judges.  See, e. g., Busic v. United States, 446 U.S. 398, 100 S.Ct. 1747, 64 L.Ed.2d 381 (1980);  LaRocca v. United States (decided with Busic).  The temptation to exceed our limited judicial role and do what we regard as the more sensible thing is great, but it takes us on a slippery slope.  Our duty, to paraphrase Mr. Justice Holmes in a conversation with Judge Learned Hand, is not to do justice but to apply the law and hope that justice is done.  The Spirit of Liberty:  Papers and addresses of Learned Hand 306-307 (Dilliard ed. 1960).\\n\\n\\n57\\nNot without the same reluctance that in my view underlies the Court\\'s opinion, I join the opinion.\\n\\n\\n58\\nMr. Justice STEVENS, with whom Mr. Justice WHITE and Mr. Justice REHNQUIST join, dissenting.\\n\\n\\n59\\nShould the directors of a narcotics distribution business be punished less severely than their subordinates who merely peddle the poison?  It is unlikely that Congress so intended.  See Callanan v. United States, 364 U.S. 587, 593-594, 81 S.Ct. 321, 325, 5 L.Ed.2d 312.\\n\\n\\n60\\nSince an ordinary reading of § 4061 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 implies that a conspirator may be punished just as severely as a substantive offender, I would so construe the statute.  This construction is fortified by the total absence of any statement by any legislator suggesting any purpose to treat conspirators in the drug trade with any greater lenity than substantive offenders.2  This is particularly important in view of the fact that prior to the 1970 Act, Congress had authorized identical penalties for conspiracies and completed offenses.  See ante at 391.\\n\\n\\n61\\nBecause the statutory language conveys quite a different meaning to me, and because the Court has not paused to consider the narrow issue presented by this case in the context of the larger objectives Congress was seeking, I respectfully dissent.\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n The Act, Pub.L. 91-513, is set forth at 84 Stat. 1236-1296.  For the sake of simplicity, further otherwise appropriate citations to the Statutes at Large will be omitted.\\n\\n\\n2\\n This provision was amended in 1978, but the amendment is not pertinent to the issue presented here.  See Pub.L. 95-633, § 201, 92 Stat. 3774, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B) (1976 ed., Supp. II).\\n\\n\\n3\\n The Court of Appeals stated that petitioner was charged with two substantive violations of § 401(a)(1), in addition to the conspiracy count, and that he was acquitted of the substantive charges.  600 F.2d 407, 408 (CA2 1979).  The parties agree, however, that this is error and that petitioner was charged with, and convicted on, a single conspiracy count.  Brief for Petitioner 4, n. 2;  Brief for United States 4, n. 2.\\n\\n\\n4\\n Two Courts of Appeals, in addition to those followed by the Second Circuit in this case, have joined in the conclusion that § 406 authorizes the imposition of a special parole term where such a term is included in the penalty provisions of the target offense.  See United States v, Sellers, 603 F.2d 53, 58 (CA8 1979), and Cantu v. United States, 598 F.2d 471, 472 (CA5 1979).  In addition, in a number of cases appellate courts have affirmed the convictions of defendants sentenced to special parole terms under § 406 without considering the question whether special parole was authorized.  For example, the question presented here may have lingered beneath the surface in United States v. Timmreck, 441 U.S. 780, 99 S.Ct. 2085, 60 L.Ed.2d 634 (1979).\\nIn Mearns, the Third Circuit followed the lead of two District Court opinions (in addition to the opinion there under review) holding that special parole is not a penalty authorized by § 406.  See United States v. Jacquinto, 464 F.Supp. 728 (ED Pa. 1979), and Fassette v. United States, 444 F.Supp. 1245 (CD Cal.1978).  Cf. United States v. Wells, 470 F.Supp. 216 (SD Iowa 1979) (adopting the Mearns rationale in sentencing, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3, accessories after the fact to a drug conspiracy).\\n\\n\\n5\\n The dissent\\'s \"ordinary reading of § 406,\" post, at 402, appears to be based on this same incomplete reading of the words of the conspiracy provision.\\n\\n\\n6\\n Section 405(b) likewise provides for treble enhancement of the fine, the term of imprisonment, and the minimum length of any special parole term, for one who is convicted a second or subsequent time for distributing a controlled substance to a minor.\\n\\n\\n7\\n The Government argues that the express reference to special parole in § 405 does not detract from the view that § 406 incorporates special parole by implication.  It contends that it was necessary for Congress to deal with special parole explicitly in § 405 because it chose to mandate a minimum special parole term of at least twice the length of the term authorized under § 401(b), whereas § 405 imposes a fine or imprisonment of up to twice that otherwise authorized.  The Government\\'s argument does not dispel the fact, however, that Congress specifically accommodated the concept of special parole in one general provision imposing sentence by reference to other offenses, but did not do so with respect to an adjacent provision, § 406.\\n\\n\\n8\\n The Government would explain the specificity of § 401(c) as an instance where the drafters of that provision \"simply looked to see what sections of the proposed bill used the term special parole, and inserted those section numbers into [the forerunner of § 401(c)].\"  Brief for United States 26-27, n. 22.  It argues, of course, that although § 406 did not refer to special parole in so many words, it did incorporate the sentencing provisions of § 401. We reject the Government\\'s argument for reasons stated in the text.  Moreover, its \"explanation\" assumes a carelessness in draftsmanship that probably is unwarranted;  see the following subparts B and C.\\n\\n\\n9\\n See 21 U.S.C. §§ 174, 176a, 176b (1964 ed.);  and 26 U.S.C. §§ 7237(a) and (b) (1964 ed.).\\n\\n\\n10\\n See S. 1895, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., §§ 701-708 (1969), and S. 2637, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., §§ 501-508 (1969), reprinted in Narcotics Legislation:  Hearings on S. 1895 et al. before the Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 91st Cong., 1st Sess,. 69-77, 160-170 (1969).  See also H.R. 13743 and H.R. 14774, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., §§ 501-508 (1969), reprinted in Part 1, Drug Abuse Control Amendments—1970:  Hearings on H.R. 11701 and H.R. 13743 before the Subcommittee on Public Health and Welfare of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., 17-20 (1970).\\n\\n\\n11\\n A chart setting out the alternative penalty schemes proposed by the Justice Department is included in the record of hearings held before the Subcommittee on Public Health and Welfare of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce.  Id., at 90-92.  This chart describes the penalty provisions favored by the Department for attempt and conspiracy as providing \"that any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense under the Act may be punished by imprisonment and/or fine, which may not exceed the maximum punishment proscribed for committing the offense.\"  Id., at 92.  No mention is made of special parole terms in the conspiracy context.  It seems, therefore, that the inexact draftsmanship that the Government would find in the legislative history of § 406 is not to be attributed solely to Congress.\\n\\n\\n12\\n The forerunner to § 401(b)(1)(B) was § 501(c)(2) of S. 3246.  It provided an identical penalty scheme for first offenders as does the current substantive offense—a term of imprisonment of not more than five years, a fine of not more than $15,000, or both, and a 2-year minimum special parole term in addition to any term of imprisonment.  See S.Rep. No. 91-613, at 116.\\n\\n\\n13\\n Section 504 of S. 3246, which differed from § 406 only in its use of the term \"endeavor\" rather than \"attempt,\" provided:\\n\"Any person who endeavors or conspires to commit any offense defined in this title is punishable by imprisonment or fine or both which may not exceed the maximum punishment prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the endeavor or conspiracy.\"  S.Rep. No. 91-613, at 118.\\n\\n\\n14\\n An identical provision was contained in H.R. 17463, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., § 508(a) (1970), a forerunner of the Act approved by one of the two House Committees to conduct hearings on the proposed narcotics legislation.  See Controlled Dangerous Substances, Narcotics and Drug Control Laws;  Hearings on H.R. 17463 before the House Committee on Ways and Means, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., 69 (1970) (hereinafter Ways and Means Hearings).  The bill eventually passed by the House, H.R. 18583, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970), incorporated enhanced penalties for repeat offenders within the individual substantive offenses.  See 116 Cong.Rec. 33625 (1970).  The House bills are discussed further below.\\n\\n\\n15\\n The Government makes the same argument with respect to the repeat offender provisions of S. 3246 and H.R. 17463 that it makes with respect to § 405, see n. 7, supra.  The argument is no more persuasive here.\\n\\n\\n16\\n The dissent takes us to task for failing to recognize that it is unlikely that Congress would intend that \"the directors of a narcotics distribution business be punished less severely than their subordinates who merely peddle the poison.\"  Post, at 402.  But even a cursory reading of the Act should make it clear that our opinion today will not result in the sentencing disparity the dissent fears.  Section 406\\'s punishment provisions are not the sole sanctions Congress enacted for apprehended directors of organized drug trafficking operations.  First, nothing prevents the Government from prosecuting the operators of a distribution network, either as principals or as aiders and abettors, for substantive manufacturing, distribution, and possession offenses, pursuant to § 401 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 841.  Second, and more significantly, Congress enacted two special provisions with the directors of large trafficking operations particularly in mind. The sanctions available under those provisions are especially severe.  See § 408 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 848 (continuing criminal enterprise);  §§ 409(e)(2) and (3) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 849(e)(2) and (3) (defining a special drug offender).\\n\\n\\n17\\n One might quarrel with our conclusion that Congress was aware of the distinction between the penalty provisions of § 401(b)(1)(B) and § 406, and chose not to include special parole terms among the sanctions authorized for attempts and conspiracies.  That it would be extremely difficult to accept the Government\\'s argument that Congress unambiguously intended a contrary result, however, perhaps is best evidenced by the fact that the rule of lenity is not mentioned, let alone applied, in any of the lower court opinions that have accepted the Government\\'s position.  See cases cited in n. 4, supra, and accompanying text.  The dissenting opinion would appear to fare little better on that score.\\n\\n\\n1\\n \"Any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this title is punishable by imprisonment or fine or both which may not exceed the maximum punishment prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.\"  84 Stat. 1265, 21 U.S.C. § 846.\\n\\n\\n2\\n Surely the Court\\'s reference ante, at 399, to the offense of attempt cuts the other way, for it is common for legislation to authorize the same range of punishments for attempts as for substantive offenses.  See, e. g., American Law Institute, Model Penal Code § 5.05(1) (Prop. Off. Draft 1962), which provides in part:  \"Except as otherwise provided in this Section, attempt, solicitation and conspiracy are crimes of the same grade and degree as the most serious offense which is attempted or solicited or is an object of the conspiracy.\"\\n\\n\\n'}]\n",

UNITED STATES\\n\\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\\n                 THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT\\n\\nNo. 12–7515. Argued November 12, 2013—Decided January 27, 2014\\nLong-time drug user Banka died following an extended binge that in-\\n  cluded using heroin purchased from petitioner Burrage. Burrage\\n  pleaded not guilty to a superseding indictment alleging, inter alia,\\n  that he had unlawfully distributed heroin and that “death . . . result-\\n  ed from the use of th[at] substance”—thus subjecting Burrage to a\\n  20-year mandatory minimum sentence under the penalty enhance-\\n  ment provision of the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U. S. C.\\n  §841(b)(1)(C). After medical experts testified at trial that Banka\\n  might have died even if he had not taken the heroin, Burrage moved\\n  for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that Banka’s death could only\\n  “result from” heroin use if there was evidence that heroin was a but-\\n  for cause of death. The court denied the motion and, as relevant\\n  here, instructed the jury that the Government only had to prove that\\n  heroin was a contributing cause of death. The jury convicted Bur-\\n  rage, and the court sentenced him to 20 years. In affirming, the\\n  Eighth Circuit upheld the District Court’s jury instruction.\\nHeld: At least where use of the drug distributed by the defendant is not\\n an independently sufficient cause of the victim’s death or serious bod-\\n ily injury, a defendant cannot be liable for penalty enhancement un-\\n der §841(b)(1)(C) unless such use is a but-for cause of the death or in-\\n jury. Pp. 4–15.\\n     (a) Section 841(b)(1)(C)’s “death results” enhancement, which in-\\n creased the minimum and maximum sentences to which Burrage was\\n exposed, is an element that must be submitted to the jury and found\\n beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., Alleyne v. United States, 570\\n U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 4–5.\\n    (b) Because the Controlled Substances Act does not define “results\\n from,” the phrase should be given its ordinary meaning. See Asgrow\\n\\x0c2                     BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                                  Syllabus\\n\\n    Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187. Ordinarily, that phrase\\n    imposes a requirement of actual causality, i.e., proof “ ‘that the harm\\n    would not have occurred’ in the absence of—that is, but for—the de-\\n    fendant’s conduct.” University of Tex. Southwestern Medical Center\\n    v. Nassar, 570 U. S. ___, ___. Similar statutory phrases—“because\\n    of,” see id., at ___, “ ‘based on,’ ” Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr,\\n    551 U. S. 47, 63, and “ ‘by reason of,’ ” Gross v. FBL Financial Ser-\\n    vices, Inc., 557 U. S. 167, 176—have been read to impose a but-for\\n    causation requirement. This Court declines to adopt the Govern-\\n    ment’s permissive interpretation of “results from” to mean that use of\\n    a drug distributed by the defendant need only contribute to an aggre-\\n    gate force, e.g., mixed-drug intoxication, that is itself a but-for cause\\n    of death. There is no need to address a special rule developed for\\n    cases in which multiple sufficient causes independently, but concur-\\n    rently, produce death, since there was no evidence that Banka’s hero-\\n    in use was an independently sufficient cause of his death. And\\n    though Congress could have written §841(b)(1)(C) to make an act or\\n    omission a cause-in-fact if it was a “substantial” or “contributing” fac-\\n    tor in producing death, Congress chose instead to use language that\\n    imports but-for causality. Pp. 6–12.\\n       (c) Whether adopting the but-for causation requirement or the\\n    Government’s interpretation raises policy concerns is beside the\\n    point, for the Court’s role is to apply the statute as written.

When\\nNoragon woke up a few hours later, she found Banka dead\\nin the bathroom and called 911. A search of the couple’s\\nhome and car turned up syringes, 0.59 grams of heroin,\\nalprazolam and clonazepam tablets, oxycodone pills, a\\nbottle of hydrocodone, and other drugs.\\n   Burrage pleaded not guilty to a superseding indictment\\nalleging two counts of distributing heroin in violation of\\n§841(a)(1). Only one of those offenses, count 2, is at\\nissue here. (Count 1 related to an alleged distribution of\\nheroin five months earlier than the sale to Banka.) Count 2\\nalleged that Burrage unlawfully distributed heroin on\\nApril 14, 2010, and that “death . . . resulted from the use\\nof th[at] substance”—thus subjecting Burrage to the 20\\xad\\nyear mandatory minimum of §841(b)(1)(C).\\n   Two medical experts testified at trial regarding the\\ncause of Banka’s death. Dr. Eugene Schwilke, a forensic\\ntoxicologist, determined that multiple drugs were present\\nin Banka’s system at the time of his death, including\\nheroin metabolites, codeine, alprazolam, clonazepam metab-\\nolites, and oxycodone.

She described the cause of\\ndeath as “mixed drug intoxication” with heroin, oxycodone,\\nalprazolam, and clonazepam all playing a “contributing”\\nrole. Id., at 157.

Id., at 30. The\\ncourt also declined to give Burrage’s proposed jury instruc\\xad\\ntions regarding causation. One of those instructions\\nwould have required the Government to prove that heroin\\nuse “was the proximate cause of [Banka’s] death.” Id., at\\n236. Another would have defined proximate cause as\\n“a cause of death that played a substantial part in bring\\xad\\ning about the death,” meaning that “[t]he death must\\nhave been either a direct result of or a reasonably probable\\nconsequence of the cause and except for the cause the\\ndeath would not have occurred.” Id., at 238. The court\\ninstead gave an instruction requiring the Government to\\nprove “that the heroin distributed by the Defendant was a\\ncontributing cause of Joshua Banka’s death.” Id., at 241–\\n242. The jury convicted Burrage on both counts, and the\\ncourt sentenced him to 20 years’ imprisonment, consistent\\nwith §841(b)(1)(C)’s prescribed minimum.\\n   The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed\\nBurrage’s convictions. 687 F. 3d 1015.

These default sentencing rules do not apply,\\nhowever, when “death or serious bodily injury results from\\nthe use of [the distributed] substance.” §841(b)(1)(A)–(C).\\nIn those instances, the defendant “shall be sentenced to a\\nterm of imprisonment which . . . shall be not less than\\ntwenty years or more than life,” a substantial fine, “or\\nboth.”2 Ibid.\\n   Because the “death results” enhancement increased the\\nminimum and maximum sentences to which Burrage was\\nexposed, it is an element that must be submitted to the\\njury and found beyond a reasonable doubt.

Thus,\\nthe crime charged in count 2 of Burrage’s superseding\\nindictment has two principal elements: (i) knowing or\\nintentional distribution of heroin, §841(a)(1),3 and (ii)\\ndeath caused by (“resulting from”) the use of that drug,\\n§841(b)(1)(C).\\n\\n\\n\\n——————\\n  2 Although this language, read literally, suggests that courts may\\n\\nimpose a fine or a prison term, it is undisputed here that the “death\\nresults” provision mandates a prison sentence. Courts of Appeals have\\nconcluded, in effect, that the “or” is a scrivener’s error, see, e.g., United\\nStates v. Musser, 856 F. 2d 1484, 1486 (CA11 1988) (per curiam). The\\nbest evidence of that is the concluding sentence of §841(b)(1)(C), which\\nstates that a court “shall not place on probation or suspend the sen\\xad\\ntence of any person sentenced under the provisions of this subpara\\xad\\ngraph which provide for a mandatory term of imprisonment if death or\\nserious bodily injury results.” (Emphasis added.)\\n  3 Violation of §841(a)(1) is thus a lesser included offense of the crime\\n\\ncharged in count 2. It is undisputed that Burrage is guilty of that\\nlesser included offense.\\n\\x0c6               BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                     Opinion of the Court\\n\\n                             III\\n\\n                              A\\n\\n    The law has long considered causation a hybrid concept,\\nconsisting of two constituent parts: actual cause and legal\\ncause. H. Hart & A. Honoré, Causation in the Law 104\\n(1959). When a crime requires “not merely conduct but\\nalso a specified result of conduct,” a defendant generally\\nmay not be convicted unless his conduct is “both (1) the\\nactual cause, and (2) the ‘legal’ cause (often called the\\n‘proximate cause’) of the result.” 1 W. LaFave, Substan\\xad\\ntive Criminal Law §6.4(a), pp. 464–466 (2d ed. 2003) (here\\xad\\ninafter LaFave); see also ALI, Model Penal Code §2.03,\\np. 25 (1985). Those two categories roughly coincide with\\nthe two questions on which we granted certiorari. We find\\nit necessary to decide only the first: whether the use of\\nheroin was the actual cause of Banka’s death in the sense\\nthat §841(b)(1)(C) requires.\\n    The Controlled Substances Act does not define the\\nphrase “results from,” so we give it its ordinary meaning.\\nSee Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S. 179, 187\\n(1995). A thing “results” when it “[a]rise[s] as an effect,\\nissue, or outcome from some action, process or design.”\\n2 The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 2570 (1993).\\n“Results from” imposes, in other words, a requirement of\\nactual causality. “In the usual course,” this requires proof\\n“ ‘that the harm would not have occurred’ in the absence\\nof—that is, but for—the defendant’s conduct.” University\\nof Tex. Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, 570 U. S.\\n___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 5–6) (quoting Restatement of\\nTorts §431, Comment a (1934)). The Model Penal Code\\nreflects this traditional understanding; it states that\\n“[c]onduct is the cause of a result” if “it is an antecedent\\nbut for which the result in question would not have oc\\xad\\ncurred.” §2.03(1)(a). That formulation represents “the\\nminimum requirement for a finding of causation when a\\ncrime is defined in terms of conduct causing a particular\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 571 U.

W. 2d 852, 862 (Mo.\\n1993) (same).\\n   Thus, “where A shoots B, who is hit and dies, we can say\\nthat A [actually] caused B’s death, since but for A’s con\\xad\\nduct B would not have died.” LaFave 467–468 (italics\\nomitted). The same conclusion follows if the predicate act\\ncombines with other factors to produce the result, so long\\nas the other factors alone would not have done so—if, so to\\nspeak, it was the straw that broke the camel’s back. Thus,\\nif poison is administered to a man debilitated by multiple\\ndiseases, it is a but-for cause of his death even if those\\ndiseases played a part in his demise, so long as, without\\nthe incremental effect of the poison, he would have lived.\\nSee, e.g., State v. Frazier, 339 Mo. 966, 974–975, 98 S. W.\\n2d 707, 712–713 (1936).\\n   This but-for requirement is part of the common under\\xad\\nstanding of cause. Consider a baseball game in which the\\nvisiting team’s leadoff batter hits a home run in the top of\\nthe first inning. If the visiting team goes on to win by a\\nscore of 1 to 0, every person competent in the English\\nlanguage and familiar with the American pastime would\\nagree that the victory resulted from the home run. This is\\nso because it is natural to say that one event is the out\\xad\\ncome or consequence of another when the former would\\nnot have occurred but for the latter. It is beside the point\\nthat the victory also resulted from a host of other neces\\xad\\nsary causes, such as skillful pitching, the coach’s decision\\nto put the leadoff batter in the lineup, and the league’s\\ndecision to schedule the game. By contrast, it makes little\\nsense to say that an event resulted from or was the out\\xad\\ncome of some earlier action if the action merely played a\\nnonessential contributing role in producing the event. If\\nthe visiting team wound up winning 5 to 2 rather than\\n\\x0c8                BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                      Opinion of the Court\\n\\n1 to 0, one would be surprised to read in the sports page\\nthat the victory resulted from the leadoff batter’s early,\\nnon-dispositive home run.\\n  Where there is no textual or contextual indication to the\\ncontrary, courts regularly read phrases like “results from”\\nto require but-for causality. Our interpretation of statutes\\nthat prohibit adverse employment action “because of ” an\\nemployee’s age or complaints about unlawful workplace\\ndiscrimination is instructive. Last Term, we addressed\\nTitle VII’s antiretaliation provision, which states in part:\\n    “It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an\\n    employer . . . to discriminate against any individual\\n    . . . because he has opposed any practice made an un\\xad\\n    lawful employment practice by this subchapter, or be-\\n    cause he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or\\n    participated in any manner in an investigation,\\n    proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.” 42\\n    U. S. C. §2000e–3(a) (2006 ed.) (emphasis added).\\nGiven the ordinary meaning of the word “because,” we\\nheld that §2000e–3(a) “require[s] proof that the desire to\\nretaliate was [a] but-for cause of the challenged employ\\xad\\nment action.” Nassar, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11–12).\\nThe same result obtained in an earlier case interpreting a\\nprovision in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act\\nthat makes it “unlawful for an employer . . . to discharge\\nany individual or otherwise discriminate against any\\nindividual with respect to his compensation, terms, condi\\xad\\ntions, or privileges of employment, because of such indi\\xad\\nvidual’s age.” 29 U.

Co. of America v. Burr, 551 U. S. 47, 63 (2007), and\\nthat “the phrase, ‘by reason of,’ requires at least a showing\\nof ‘but for’ causation,” Gross, supra, at 176 (citing Bridge\\nv. Phoenix Bond & Indemnity Co., 553 U. S. 639, 653–654\\n(2008)). See also Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection\\nCorporation, 503 U.

State\\ncourts, which hear and decide the bulk of the Nation’s\\ncriminal matters, usually interpret similarly worded crim-\\ninal statutes in the same manner. See, e.g., People v.\\nWood, 276 Mich. App. 669, 671, 741 N.

See Univer-\\nsity of Tex. Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, 570 U. S. ___, ___\\n(2013) (slip op., at 7–10). Congress later amended the statute to\\ndispense with but-for causality.

E. 2d 754, 763 (1978) (statute requiring sup\\xad\\npression of evidence “ ‘obtained as a result of ’ ” police\\nmisconduct “requires, at a minimum,” a but-for causal\\nrelationship between the misconduct and collection of the\\nevidence).\\n   In sum, it is one of the traditional background principles\\n“against which Congress legislate[s],” Nassar, 570 U. S., at\\n___ (slip op., at 6–7), that a phrase such as “results from”\\nimposes a requirement of but-for causation. The Govern\\xad\\nment argues, however, that distinctive problems associated\\nwith drug overdoses counsel in favor of dispensing with\\nthe usual but-for causation requirement. Addicts often\\ntake drugs in combination, as Banka did in this case, and\\naccording to the National Center for Injury Prevention\\nand Control, at least 46 percent of overdose deaths in 2010\\ninvolved more than one drug. See Brief for United States\\n28–29. This consideration leads the Government to urge\\nan interpretation of “results from” under which use of a\\ndrug distributed by the defendant need not be a but-for\\ncause of death, nor even independently sufficient to cause\\ndeath, so long as it contributes to an aggregate force (such\\nas mixed-drug intoxication) that is itself a but-for cause of\\ndeath.\\n   In support of its argument, the Government can point to\\nthe undoubted reality that courts have not always re\\xad\\nquired strict but-for causality, even where criminal liabil\\xad\\nity is at issue. The most common (though still rare) in\\xad\\nstance of this occurs when multiple sufficient causes\\nindependently, but concurrently, produce a result. See\\nNassar, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 6); see also LaFave 467\\n(describing these cases as “unusual” and “numerically in\\nthe minority”). To illustrate, if “A stabs B, inflicting a\\nfatal wound; while at the same moment X, acting inde\\xad\\npendently, shoots B in the head . . . also inflicting [a fatal]\\nwound; and B dies from the combined effects of the two\\nwounds,” A will generally be liable for homicide even\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 571 U.

We need not accept or reject\\nthe special rule developed for these cases, since there was\\nno evidence here that Banka’s heroin use was an inde\\xad\\npendently sufficient cause of his death. No expert was\\nprepared to say that Banka would have died from the\\nheroin use alone.\\n   Thus, the Government must appeal to a second, less\\ndemanding (but also less well established) line of author\\xad\\nity, under which an act or omission is considered a cause\\xad\\nin-fact if it was a “substantial” or “contributing” factor in\\nproducing a given result. Several state courts have adopted\\nsuch a rule, see State v. Christman, 160 Wash. App.\\n741, 745, 249 P. 3d 680, 687 (2011); People v.

App. 71,\\n72–73, 681 N. E. 2d 292, 294 (1997), but the American\\nLaw Institute declined to do so in its Model Penal Code,\\nsee ALI, 39th Annual Meeting Proceedings 135–141\\n(1962); see also Model Penal Code §2.03(1)(a). One promi\\xad\\nnent authority on tort law asserts that “a broader rule . . .\\nhas found general acceptance: The defendant’s conduct is\\na cause of the event if it was a material element and a\\nsubstantial factor in bringing it about.” W. Keeton, D.\\nDobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law\\nof Torts §41, p. 267 (5th ed. 1984) (footnote omitted). But\\nthe authors of that treatise acknowledge that, even in the\\ntort context, “[e]xcept in the classes of cases indicated” (an\\napparent reference to the situation where each of two\\ncauses is independently effective) “no case has been found\\nwhere the defendant’s act could be called a substantial\\nfactor when the event would have occurred without it.”\\nId., at 268. The authors go on to offer an alternative\\nrule—functionally identical to the one the Government\\n\\x0c12              BURRAGE v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                     Opinion of the Court\\n\\nargues here—that “[w]hen the conduct of two or more\\nactors is so related to an event that their combined con\\xad\\nduct, viewed as a whole, is a but-for cause of the event,\\nand application of the but-for rule to them individually\\nwould absolve all of them, the conduct of each is a cause in\\nfact of the event.” Ibid. Yet, as of 1984, “no judicial opin\\xad\\nion ha[d] approved th[at] formulation.” Ibid., n. 40. The\\n“death results” enhancement became law just two years\\nlater.\\n   We decline to adopt the Government’s permissive inter\\xad\\npretation of §841(b)(1). The language Congress enacted\\nrequires death to “result from” use of the unlawfully dis\\xad\\ntributed drug, not from a combination of factors to which\\ndrug use merely contributed. Congress could have written\\n§841(b)(1)(C) to impose a mandatory minimum when the\\nunderlying crime “contributes to” death or serious bodily\\ninjury, or adopted a modified causation test tailored to\\ncases involving concurrent causes, as five States have\\ndone, see Ala. Code §13A–2–5(a) (2005); Ark. Code Ann.\\n§5–2–205 (2006); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17–A, §33\\n(2006); N. D. Cent. Code Ann. §12.1–02–05 (Lexis 2012);\\nTex. Penal Code Ann. §6.04 (West 2011). It chose instead\\nto use language that imports but-for causality. Especially\\nin the interpretation of a criminal statute subject to the\\nrule of lenity, see Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103,\\n107–108 (1990), we cannot give the text a meaning that is\\ndifferent from its ordinary, accepted meaning, and that\\ndisfavors the defendant.\\n                             B\\n  The Government objects that the ordinary meaning of\\n“results from” will “unduly limi[t] criminal responsibility”\\nand “cannot be reconciled with sound policy.” Brief for\\nUnited States 24.

Krieger, 628 F. 3d 857, 870–871 (CA7\\n2010) (affirming “death results” conviction based on expert\\ntestimony that, although the victim had several drugs in\\nher system, the drug distributed by the defendant was a\\nbut-for cause of death); United States v. Webb, 655 F. 3d\\n1238, 1254–1255 (CA11 2011) (per curiam) (same). More\\xad\\nover, even when the prosecution is unable to prove but-for\\ncausation, the defendant will still be liable for violating\\n§841(a)(1) and subject to a substantial default sentence\\nunder §841(b)(1).\\n   Indeed, it is more likely the Government’s proposal that\\n“cannot be reconciled with sound policy,” given the need\\nfor clarity and certainty in the criminal law. The judicial\\nauthorities invoking a “substantial” or “contributing”\\nfactor test in criminal cases differ widely in their applica\\xad\\ntion of it. Compare Wilson v. State, 24 S. W. 409, 410\\n(Tex. Crim.

UNITED STATES.\\nNos. 78-6020, 78-6029.\\nArgued Feb. 27, 1980.\\nDecided May 19, 1980.\\n\\n\\nSyllabus\\n*\\n\\nUpon their joint trial in Federal District Court, petitioners were convicted of, inter alia, armed assault on federal officers petitioner LaRocca as the actual triggerman and petitioner Busic as an aider and abettor and thus derivatively a principal under 18 U.S.C. § 2—in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 111, which makes it unlawful to assault a federal officer and which provides for enhanced punishment when the assaulter \"uses\" a deadly weapon.  In addition, LaRocca was convicted of using, and Busic of carrying, a firearm in the commission of the armed assault, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), which authorizes the imposition of enhanced penalties on a defendant who \"uses\" (§ 924(c)(1)) or \"carries\" (§ 924(c)(2)) a firearm while committing a federal felony.  Each petitioner\\'s sentence included 5 years on possession of firearms and the assault charges, and 20 years for the § 924(c) violations. The Court of Appeals ultimately held that, while LaRocca\\'s sentence could not be enhanced under both § 111 and § 924(c)(1) for \"using\" a firearm, he could be sentenced under either at the Government\\'s election, but that, since the § 924(c) charge against Busic alleged not that he \"used\" a firearm but rather that he \"carried\" one, his sentence was valid.\\nHeld :  Section 924(c) may not be applied to a defendant who uses a firearm in the course of a felony that is proscribed by a statute which itself authorizes enhancement if a dangerous weapon is used.  The sentence received by such a defendant may be enhanced only under the enhancement provision in the statute defining the felony he committed.  Pp. 403-411.\\n(a) This result is supported not only by Simpson v. United States, 435 U.S. 6, 98 S.Ct. 909, 55 L.Ed.2d 70, but also by the legislative history of § 924(c) and the canons of statutory construction that ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity, and that a more specific statute (18 U.S.C. § 111 here) will be given precedence over a more general one (§ 924(c)), even if, as here, the general provision was enacted later.  To the extent that this construction may lead to irrational sentencing patterns in which some less severe crimes are punished more than other more severe crimes, it is the Congress, not this Court, that must take corrective action.  Pp. 403-410.\\n(b) This holding not only makes it clear that petitioner LaRocca may not be sentenced under § 924(c)(1) for using his gun to assault federal officers, but also applies to petitioner Busic\\'s case.  Nor can Busic\\'s sentence be sustained by arguing that a person who carries a gun in the commission of a § 111 violation may be sentenced under § 924(c)(2) because the enhancement provision of § 111 does not apply to those who carry but do not use their weapons.  The fact is that Busic is being punished for using a weapon.  Through the combination of § 111 and 18 U.S.C. § 2, he was found guilty as a principal of using a firearm to assault federal agents.  Pp. 410-411.\\n3rd Cir., 587 F.2d 577, reversed and remanded.\\nGerald Goldman, Washington, D. C., for Michael M. Busic.\\nSamuel J. Reich, Pittsburgh, Pa., for LaRocca.\\nMark I.

The question for decision in these cases is whether that section may be applied to a defendant who uses a firearm in the course of a felony that is proscribed by a statute which itself authorizes enhancement if a dangerous weapon is used.  We hold that the sentence received by such a defendant may be enhanced only under the enhancement provision in the statute defining the felony he committed and that § 924(c) does not apply in such a case.\\n\\n\\n2\\n* Petitioners Anthony LaRocca, Jr., and Michael Busic were tried together on a multicount indictment charging drug, firearms, and assault offenses flowing from a narcotics conspiracy and an attempt to rob an undercover agent.  The evidence showed that in May 1976 the two arranged a drug buy with an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration who was to supply $30,000 in cash. When the agent arrived with the money, LaRocca attempted to rob him at gunpoint.  The agent signalled for reinforcements, and as other officers began to close in LaRocca fired several shots at them.  No one was hit and the agents succeeded in disarming and arresting LaRocca.  Busic was also arrested and the officers seized a gun he was carrying in his belt but had not drawn. Additional weapons were found in the pair\\'s automobile.1\\n\\n\\n3\\nA jury in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania convicted petitioners of narcotics and possession-of-firearms counts,2 and of two counts of armed assault on federal officers in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 111—LaRocca as the actual triggerman and Busic as an aider and abettor, and thus derivatively a principal under 18 U.S.C. § 2.  In addition, LaRocca was convicted of using a firearm in the commission of a federal felony in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1), and Busic was convicted of carrying a firearm in the commission of a federal felony in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(2).3  Each petitioner was sentenced to a total of 30 years, of which 5 resulted from concurrent sentences on the narcotics charges, 5 were a product of concurrent terms on the firearms and assault charges, and 20 were imposed for the § 924(c) violations.\\n\\n\\n4\\nThe defendants appealed, contending, among other things, that they could not be sentenced consecutively for assaulting a federal officer with a dangerous weapon as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1114 and for the use of a firearm in connection with that crime as provided in § 924(c).5  In an opinion announced before Simpson v.United States, 435 U.S. 6, 98 S.Ct. 909, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978), was decided, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit concluded that the imposition in LaRocca\\'s case of enhanced sentences under both § 924(c) and § 111 for a single assault with a firearm violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment because the two statutes required proof of identical elements.  587 F.2d 577, 583-584 (1978).  Accordingly, LaRocca\\'s case was remanded to the District Court for resentencing under either § 111 or § 924(c), at the Government\\'s election. Since the § 924(c) charge against Busic alleged not that he used a firearm (§ 924(c)(1)), but rather that hecarried one (§ 924(c)(2)), the Court of Appeals held that no like infirmity invalidated his conviction and sentence.  In its view, the § 111 and § 924(c) charges against him did not require proof of the same elements and hence did not merge because the former could be established merely by showing that Busic had aided and abetted LaRocca\\'s use of a gun to assault the federal officers, while the latter required proof of the additional fact that Busic had unlawfully carried a gun.  587 F.2d, at 584.\\n\\n\\n5\\nFollowing this Court\\'s decision in Simpson v. United States, supra, the Court of Appeals granted a petition for rehearing and vacated its double jeopardy holding with regard to LaRocca on grounds there was no reason to reach the constitutional question. 587 F.2d, at 587-589.  Thereafter, it proceeded as a matter of statutory construction to arrive at a nearly identical conclusion namely, that LaRocca\\'s sentence could not be enhanced under both § 111 and § 924(c) but that he could be sentenced under either at the Government\\'s election.  The Court of Appeals did not alter its holding with regard to Busic. We granted certiorari, 442 U.S. 916, 99 S.Ct. 2835, 61 L.Ed.2d 282 (1979), and now reverse the enhanced sentences that were imposed on both petitioners under § 924(c).\\n\\nII\\n\\n6\\nWe turn first to the case of petitioner LaRocca because it poses most directly the key question of legislative intent.  Our starting point, like that of the parties, is Simpson, supra. There we considered the relationship between § 924(c) and the federal bank robbery statute, 18 U.S.C. § 2113, which, like the assault provision at issue here, 18 U.S.C. § 111, predates § 924(c) and provides by its own terms for enhanced punishment where the felony is committed with a dangerous weapon.6  Relying upon the legislative history and applicable canons of statutory construction, Simpson held that the Congress cannot be understood to have intended that a defendant who has been convicted of robbing a bank with a firearm may be sentenced under both § 924(c) and § 2113(d).  The parties to the instant cases agree that Simpson clearly prohibits the imposition on these petitioners of similarly enhanced sentences under both § 924(c) and § 111.  But the Government contends that Simpson resolved only the double enhancement question—that the Court\\'s holding and opinion should not be read to find § 924(c) inapplicable where the prosecution proceeds under that provision rather than the enhancement provision of a predicate felony statute like § 111.  Such a reading, the Government asserts, is supported by the facts presented in Simpson,7 the language used to describe the actual \"holding,\"8 the most likely inferences that may be drawn as to what Congress would have wanted had it focussed on the precise problem,9 and the asserted irrationality of some of the consequences that would flow from a holding that § 924(c) is inapplicable in cases like the present cases.10\\n\\n\\n7\\nWe disagree.  In our view, Simpson\\'s language and reasoning support one conclusion alone—that prosecution and enhanced sentencing under § 924(c) is simply not permissible where the predicate felony statute contains its own enhancement provision. This result is supported not only by the general principles underlying the doctrine of stare decisis —principles particularly apposite in cases of statutory construction—but also by the legislative history and relevant canons of statutory construction. The Government has not persuaded us that this result is irrational or depends upon implausible inferences as to congressional intent. And to the extent that cases can be hypothesized in which this holding may support curious or seemingly unreasonable comparative sentences, it suffices to say that the asserted unreasonableness flows not from Simpson and this decision, but rather from the statutes as Congress wrote them.  If corrective action is needed, it is the the Congress that must provide it.  \"It is not for us to speculate, much less act, on whether Congress would have altered its stance had the specific events of this case been anticipated.\" TVA v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 185, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 2297, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978).\\n\\n\\n8\\nOur reasoning has several strands.  It begins, as indeed it must, with the text and legislative history of § 924(c).  By its terms, that provision tells us nothing about the way Congress intended to mesh the new enhancement scheme with analogous provisions in pre-existing statutes defining federal crimes. Moreover, as Simpson noted, 435 U.S., at 13, 98 S.Ct., at 913, and n. 7, § 924(c) was offered as an amendment on the House floor by Representative Poff, 114 Cong.Rec. 22231 (1968), and passed on the same day.  Id., at 22248.  Accordingly, the committee reports and congressional hearings to which we normally turn for aid in these situations simply do not exist, and we are forced in consequence to search for clues to congressional intent in the sparse pages of floor debate that make up the relevant legislative history.  The crucial material for present purposes is the following observation by Representative Poff:\\n\\n\\n9\\n\"For the sake of legislative history, it should be noted      that my substitute is not intended to apply to title 18,      sections 111, 112, or 113 which already define the penalties      for the use of a firearm in assaulting officials, with      sections 2113 or 2114 concerning armed robberies of the mail      or banks, with section 2231 concerning armed assaults upon      process servers or with chapter 44 which defines other      firearm felonies.\"  Id., at 22232.\\n\\n\\n10\\nSimpson pointed out that \"[t]his statement is clearly probative of a legislative judgment that the purpose of § 924(c) is already served whenever the substantive federal offense provides enhanced punishment for use of a dangerous weapon.\"  435 U.S., at 13, 98 S.Ct., at 913.  Moreover, Representative Poff\\'s remarks were the only ones touching on the present question that were before the House when § 924(c) was adopted, and it is therefore reasonable to assume that they represent the understanding of the Congressmen who voted for the proposal.11\\n\\n\\n11\\nReliance on Representative Poff\\'s statement of legislative intent is consistent with the position taken by the Department of Justice in 1971 when it advised prosecutors not to proceed under § 924(c)(1) if the predicate felony statute provided for \" \\'increased penalties where a firearm is used in the commission of the offense.\\' \"  Simpson, supra at 16, 98 S.Ct. at 915, quoting 19 U.S.Attys. Bull. No. 3, p. 63 (U.S. Dept. of Justice, 1971). Moreover, this view is fully consistent with two tools of statutory construction relied upon in Simpson.  The first is the oft-cited rule that \" \\'ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.\\' \"  United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 347, 92 S.Ct. 515, 522, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971), quoting Rewis v. United States, 401 U.S. 808, 812, 91 S.Ct. 1056, 1059, 28 L.Ed.2d 493 (1971).  And the second is the principle that a more specific statute will be given precedence over a more general one, regardless of their temporal sequence. Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 489-490, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 1836, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973).  In Simpson, these principles counseled against double enhancement.  They served as \"an outgrowth of our reluctance to increase or multiply punishments absent a clear and definite legislative directive.\"  435 U.S., at 15-16, 98 S.Ct., at 914.  Here they play a similar role, and thus help confirm the conclusion that § 924(c) may not be applied at all in the present situation.\\n\\n\\n12\\nThe Government seeks to minimize the force of these principles of statutory construction by urging (1) that there is no ambiguity in § 924(c) and thus that the rule of lenity is not properly called into play and (2) that in fact it is § 924(c) that is the more specific statute because it relates only to firearms while § 111 would permit enhancement for any dangerous weapon.  We find each contention flawed.  As to the first, the claim that there exists no ambiguity does not stand up.  Plainly the text of the statute fails to address the issue pertinent to decision of these cases—whether Congress intended (1) to provide for enhanced penalties only for crimes not containing their own enhancement provisions, (2) to provide an alternative enhancement provision applicable to all felonies, or (3) to provide a duplicative enhancement provision which would permit double enhancement where the underlying felony was proscribed by a statute like § 111.  Our task here, as in Simpson, is to ascertain as best we can which approach Congress had in mind.  The rule of lenity, like reference to appropriate legislative materials, is one of the tools we use to do so.\\n\\n\\n13\\nThe Government\\'s second contention—that § 924(c) rather that § 111 should be viewed as the more specific statute—is both facially unpersuasive12 and likely to lead to curious consequences.  Indeed, were the Government correct we would be forced to conclude that with regard to firearms cases § 924(c) impliedly repealed all pre-existing enhancement provisions.  Yet there is not a shred of evidence to suggest that this is what Congress intended.  Moreover, such a result would be inconsistent with Simpson13 and in any event would not give the Government what it wants because it would not permit the prosecutor to choose between § 924(c) and § 111.\\n\\n\\n14\\nIn addition to contesting the rule of lenity and specific-versus-general arguments, the Government contends that our reading of the legislative materials is unreasonable because those who supported the Poff amendment—including Representative Poff himself—were clearly committed to meting out stiff penalties for use of a firearm in the course of a felony and would not have followed any course inconsistent with that commitment.  The argument is overdrawn.  In the first place, we do not think our construction is inconsistent with a congressional desire to deal severely with firearm abuses.  As we understand it, the Government\\'s argument is not that our construction reads Congress to have diminished the penalty for firearm use, but only that our construction fails to enhance that penalty to the hilt.  Yet it is patently clear that Congress too has failed to enhance that penalty to the hilt—it set maximum sentences as well as a variety of other limits on the available punishment.  Thus, while Congress had a general desire to deter firearm abuses, that desire was not unbounded.  Our task here is to locate one of the boundaries, and the inquiry is not advanced by the assertion that Congress wanted no boundaries.\\n\\n\\n15\\nMore specifically, some accommodation between § 924(c) and statutes like § 111 is obviously necessary.  And since some pre-existing statutes provided for sentences less severe than § 924(c) and others for penalties more severe,14 any rule of priority would lead in certain circumstances to a punishment less severe that might have been achieved under another rule of priority.  The Government in effect argues that had Representative Poff and his colleagues foreseen this problem they would have eschewed any priority rule and instead rested complete discretion in the prosecutor.  We do not dispute that a rule permitting prosecutors freedom of choice might give greater effect to a legislative desire to increase the penalties for firearm use, but the same could be said of any number of constructions of the statute, including the one rejected in Simpson.  Indeed, by rejecting double enhancement Simpson exposes the stark and unidimensional quality of any calculus which attempts to construe the statute on the basis of an assumption that in enacting § 924(c) Congress\\' sole objective was to increase the penalties for firearm use to the maximum extent possible.\\n\\n\\n16\\nThe fact that the enhanced sentences authorized in some predicate felony statutes are greater than those set forth in § 924(c) while those in others are less provides a partial response to the Government\\'s contention that our construction would lead to irrational sentencing patterns in which some less severe crimes are punished more than other more severe ones.15  The fact is that any interpretation might have led to differences in treatment that are not intuitively reasonable. In consequence, the presence of differences here fails to shake our confidence in our construction.  More broadly, it is simply not for this Court to substitute its accommodation between old and new enhancement provisions for the one apparently chosen by Congress.  On the contrary, \"in our constitutional system the commitment to the separation of powers is too fundamental for us to pre-empt congressional action by judicially decreeing what accords with \\'commonsense and the public weal.\\' \"  TVA v. Hill, 437 U.S., at 195, 98 S.Ct., at 2302.\\n\\nIII\\n\\n17\\nWhat we have said thus far disposes of LaRocca\\'s case by making it clear that he may not be sentenced under § 924(c) for using his gun to assault the federal officers.  This holding also applies in Busic\\'s case.  But in that case the Government has a fallback position.  Even if a person who uses a gun to violate § 111 may not be sentenced for doing so under § 924(c)(1), the argument goes, a person who carries a gun in the commission of a § 111 violation may be sentenced under § 924(c)(2) because the enhancement provision of § 111 does not apply to those who carry but do not use their weapons.  Thus, the Government urges, whatever our holding with regard to LaRocca, Busic may be sentenced under § 924(c)(2) for carrying his gun while committing the crime of aiding and abetting LaRocca\\'s violation of § 111.\\n\\n\\n18\\nThe central flaw in this argument as applied here is that Busic is being punished for using a weapon.  Through the combination of § 111 and 18 U.S.C. § 2, he was found guilty as a principal of using a firearm to assault the undercover agents.16 LaRocca\\'s gun, in other words, became Busic\\'s as a matter of law.  And the Government\\'s argument thus amounts to the contention that had Busic shot one gun at the officers and carried another in his belt he could have been punished under § 111 for the one he fired and under § 924(c)(2) for the one he did not fire.  Similarly, this argument would suggest, Busic might be punished for carrying a gun in his belt and also for shooting that same gun.  Yet such results are wholly implausible.  They would stand both Simpson and our holding in Part II, supra, on their heads, impute to Congress the unlikely intention to punish each weapon as a separate offense, and create a situation in which aiders and abettors would often be more culpable and more severely punished than those whom they aid and abet.17  We decline to read the statutes to produce such an ungainly result.  It seems to us that our holding of Part II is equally applicable here—Busic\\'s vicarious assault and use of a dangerous weapon are subject to prosecution and punishment under § 111 and he has been duly prosecuted and punished pursuant to that provision.  In such a case, Simpson, the legislative history, and applicable canons of statutory construction make it clear that neither subsection of § 924(c) is available.18\\n\\n\\n19\\nThese cases are reversed and remanded to the Court of Appeals for proceedings consistent with this opinion.19\\n\\n\\n20\\nSo ordered.\\n\\n\\n21\\nMr. Justice BLACKMUN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, concurring.\\n\\n\\n22\\nI join the Court\\'s opinion, holding that the decision in Simpson v. United States, 435 U.S. 6, 98 S.Ct. 909, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978), leads to the conclusion that 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) is inapplicable where a defendant is charged with committing a substantive federal offense violative of a statute that already provides for enhanced punishment for the use of a firearm.\\n\\n\\n23\\nIt should be made clear, however, that the Court of Appeals\\' initial opinion in these cases, discussed by the Court, ante, at 401-402, reflects the confusion that has existed among lower courts about the meaning of this Court\\'s recent pronouncements respecting the multiple punishments aspect of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  See Whalen v. United States, 445 U.S. 684, 697-698, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1440-1442, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980) (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in judgment).  The Court of Appeals there rejected the view that Congress did not intend the enhancement provisions of § 924(c) to apply when the substantive offense charged was 18 U.S.C. § 111.  See 3rd Cir., 587 F.2d 577, 581-582, and n. 3.  The decision in Simpson, of course, revealed the error of that holding.  But the Court of Appeals went on to hold that regardless of Congress\\' intent to provide for enhanced punishment in this context, the Double Jeopardy Clause prevented it from doing so, at least in certain cases.  See id., at 582-584.  I do not subscribe to that view, and write separately only to state, once again, that it is my belief that when defendants are sentenced in a single proceeding, \"the question of what punishments are constitutionally permissible is not different from the question of what punishments the Legislative Branch intended to be imposed.\"  Whalen v. United States, 445 U.S., at 698, 100 S.Ct., at 1441 (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in judgment).\\n\\n\\n24\\nMr. Justice STEWART, with whom Mr. Justice STEVENS joins, dissenting.\\n\\n\\n25\\nUnder 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), \"[w]hoever—(1) uses a firearm to commit any [federal] felony  . . .,  or (2) carries a firearm unlawfully during the commission of any [federal] felony,\" is subject to a term of imprisonment in addition to that provided for the felony in question.  In Simpson v. United States, 435 U.S. 6, 98 S.Ct. 909, 55 L.Ed.2d 70, which involved both § 924(c)(1) and a felony proscribed by a statute that itself authorizes an enhanced penalty if a dangerous weapon is used, the Court held that Congress did not intend to authorize the imposition of enhanced punishments for a single criminal transaction under both § 924(c)(1) and the enhancement provision for the predicate felony.  The Court today concludes that Congress not only did not intend to authorize the imposition of double enhancement, but also did not intend § 924(c)(1) to apply at all to a felony proscribed by a statute with its own enhancement provision.  I disagree.  It is my view that § 924(c)(1) was intended to apply to all federal felonies, though subject to the limitation in Simpson against double enhancement.\\n\\n\\n26\\nCongress enacted § 924(c) as part of the Gun Control Act of 1968, Pub.L. 90-618, 82 Stat. 1213.  That legislation, enacted the year in which both Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., were assassinated, was addressed largely to the \"increasing rate of crime and lawlessness and the growing use of firearms in violent crime.\"  H.R.Rep. No. 1577, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 7 (1968), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1968, pp. 4410, 4412.  A primary objective of § 924(c), as explained by its sponsor, Representative Poff, was to \"persuade the man who is tempted to commit a Federal felony to leave his gun at home.\"  114 Cong.Rec. 22231 (1968).  Towards that end, § 924(c) provides for a prison term, in addition to that provided for the underlying felony, of not less than 1 year nor more than 10 in the case of a first offender, and of not less than 2 years nor more than 25 in the case of a second or subsequent offender.  It further provides that a sentence imposed under § 924(c) is not to run concurrently with the sentence for the predicate felony and that, in cases of repeat offenders, the defendant cannot receive probation or a suspended sentence.\\n\\n\\n27\\nBefore the enactment of § 924(c), earlier Congresses had already authorized enhanced penalties for using a dangerous weapon in the commission of certain especially serious federal felonies, including assault on a federal officer, 18 U.S.C. § 111, and bank robbery, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2113(a), (d).  Those enhancement provisions authorize terms of imprisonment of (1) not more than an additional seven years under § 111, and (2) not more than an additional five years under §§ 2113(a), (d). Neither provision requires a mandatory minimum additional sentence or authorizes increased additional sentences for recidivists.\\n\\n\\n28\\nIn Simpson, the Court held that Congress did not intend the imposition of enhanced punishments under both § 924(c)(1) and the enhancement provision for a predicate felony.  That conclusion found substantial support in the statement of Representative Poff on the House floor that \"[f]or the sake of legislative history, it should be noted that my [bill] is not intended to apply to title 18, sections 111, 112, or 113 which already define the penalties for the use of a firearm in assaulting officials, with sections 2113 or 2114 concerning armed robberies of the mail or banks, with section 2231 concerning armed assaults upon process servers or with chapter 44 which defines other firearm felonies.\"  114 Cong.Rec. 22232 (1968).\\n\\n\\n29\\nThe issue here is not that of double punishment, but instead whether the Government may obtain enhancement of punishment under § 924(c)(1), rather than under the enhancement provision for the predicate felony.  The Court today concludes that Congress did not intend § 924(c)(1) to apply at all to a predicate felony proscribed by a statute with its own enhancement provision.  It is thus the Court\\'s view that the Government may obtain an enhanced sentence only under the enhancement provision for the underlying felony itself.\\n\\n\\n30\\nAlthough this conclusion finds support in certain passages in Simpson and in the literal terms of Representative Poff\\'s statement on the House floor, it is not supported by the actual holding in Simpson, the language of the statute itself, or a fair appraisal of the intent of Congress in enacting § 924(c).  In Simpson, the Court decided only that \"in a prosecution growing out of a single transaction of bank robbery with firearms, a defendant may not be sentenced [to enhanced punishments] under both § 2113(d) and § 924(c).\"  435 U.S., at 16, 98 S.Ct., at 915 (emphasis added).  The Court did not decide whether § 924(c)(1) is available as an alternative enhancement provision.  On this latter question, the statutory language is unambiguous, for § 924(c)(1) provides, by its terms, for an enhanced penalty for \"[w]hoever  . . .  uses a firearm to commit any [federal] felony.\"  (Emphasis added.)\\n\\n\\n31\\nTo be sure, Representative Poff stated that his bill \"[was] not intended to apply\" to certain felonies proscribed by statutes that contain their own enhancement provisions.  But that statement could as easily have been directed to the question in Simpson whether § 924(c)(1) can be invoked in addition to a previously enacted enhancement provision—as to the question in this case whether § 924(c)(1) can be invoked in lieu of such a provision.\\n\\n\\n32\\nI agree with the holding in Simpson that Congress did not intend to \"pyramid\" punishments for the use of a firearm in a single criminal transaction.  Yet I find quite implausible the proposition that Congress, in enacting § 924(c)(1), did not intend this general enhancement provision—with its stiff sanctions for first offenders and even stiffer sanctions for recidivists—to serve as an alternative source of enhanced punishment for those who commit felonies, such as bank robbery and assaulting a federal officer, that had been previously singled out by Congress as warranting special enhancement, but for which a lesser enhancement sanction than that imposed by § 924(c) had been authorized.  In the light of the expressed concerns of Congress in enacting the Gun Control Act of 1968 in general and § 924(c)(1) in particular, it is far more reasonable to conclude that Congress intended § 924(c)(1) to mean precisely what it says, namely, that it applies to any federal felony.\\n\\n\\n33\\nIt is my view, in sum, that § 924(c)(1) applies to all federal felonies, though subject to the limitation in Simpson against double punishment.  Under this reading of the statute, the Government may obtain an enhanced sentence under either § 924(c)(1) or the enhancement provision for the predicate felony, but not under both.\\n\\n\\n34\\nFor the foregoing reasons, I dissent.*\\n\\n\\n35\\nMr. Justice REHNQUIST, dissenting.\\n\\n\\n36\\nI dissented from this Court\\'s decision in Simpson v. United States, 435 U.S. 6, 98 S.Ct. 909, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978), and continue to believe that case was wrongly decided.  Now, as then, I am quite amazed at this Court\\'s ability to say that 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) \"tells us nothing about the way Congress intended to mesh the new enhancement scheme with analogous provisions in pre-existing statutes defining federal crimes,\" ante, at 405, even though that section provides quite clearly that the use of a firearm in the commission of \"any felony\" shall be punished by up to 10 years\\' imprisonment \"in addition to the punishment provided for the commission of such felony  . . . .\"  Nor do I find any more persuasive the Court\\'s rehash of the legislative history of § 924(c), including Simpson § unwarranted reliance upon the remark of Representative Poff, a remark that the Court today labels \"the Poff rule,\" see ante, at 409, n. 14, and that might more properly be labeled \"the Poff amendment\" (albeit not intended as such by its proponent).\\n\\n\\n37\\nWere Simpson demonstrably a case of statutory construction, I could acquiesce to the Court\\'s reading of § 924(c) in the interest of stare decisis.  Simpson, however, was based to an unstated degree on this Court\\'s assumption that § 924(c) raised \"the prospect of double jeopardy\" because it provided for additional punishment on \"precisely the same factual showing\" as would be necessary for conviction of the underlying felony involved in that case.  See 435 U.S., at 11, 98 S.Ct., at 912.  In Simpson the Court treated the question of the constitutionality of § 924(c) as if it were separate from the question whether Congress intended to allow cumulative punishment, insisting at one point that \"[b]efore an examination is made to determine whether cumulative punishments for the two offenses are constitutionally permissible, it is necessary  . . .  to determine whether Congress intended to subject the defendant to multiple penalties for the single criminal transaction in which he engaged.\"  435 U.S., at 11-12, 98 S.Ct., at 913.  In dissent, I noted the constitutional undercurrents of the Court\\'s opinion and suggested its concerns were \"gauzy\" and \"metaphysic[al].\"  Id., at 18, 98 S.Ct., at 915.\\n\\n\\n38\\nRecently, this Court unanimously rejected Simpson \\'s constitutional premise.  In Whalen v. United States, 445 U.S. 684, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980), six Members of this Court held that Congress\\' intent to impose cumulative punishments at a single criminal proceeding completely controlled the question of double jeopardy.  See id., at 688-689, 100 S.Ct., at 1436;  id., at 697-698, 100 S.Ct., at 1441 (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in judgment).  See also ante, at 697-698 (BLACKMUN, J., concurring). Three other Members of this Court, including myself, argued that the permissibility of cumulative punishments in the same criminal proceeding presented no double jeopardy question whatsoever.  See Whalen v. United States, supra, at 696, 100 S.Ct., at 1440 (WHITE, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment);  at 701-707, 100 S.Ct., at 1443-1446 (REHNQUIST, J., joined by BURGER, C. J., dissenting).  I believe that this Court, having thus disposed of Simpson § constitutional underpinnings, should reconsider its holding that § 924(c) does not, in fact, apply to \"any felony.\" I know of no cases besides Simpson and the present decision where this Court has taken a criminal statute absolutely clear on its face, has looked to the legislative history to create an \"ambiguity,\" and then has resolved that ambiguity in a manner totally at odds with the statute\\'s plain wording.  Because I believe Simpson was wrongly decided, and because this Court has now repudiated Simpson § constitutional premise, I would overrule Simpson, vacate the judgments below, and remand for reconsideration by the Court of Appeals.\\n\\n\\n\\n*\\n The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.  See United States v. Detroit Lumber Co., 200 U.S. 321, 337, 26 S.Ct. 282, 287, 50 L.Ed. 499.\\n\\n\\n1\\n The facts are recited in the opinion of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.  587 F.2d 577, 579-580 (1978).\\n\\n\\n2\\n The five narcotics counts alleged violations of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 843(b), and 846.  The firearms counts involving both petitioners charged violations of 26 U.S.C. §§ 5861(c), 5861(d), and 5871, and 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(h) and 924(a).  LaRocca was named in six of these counts and Busic in five.  In addition, Busic was convicted on three counts of unlawful firearms possession in violation of 18 U.S.C.App. § 1202(a)(1).  The indictment is reproduced at App. 5-15.\\n\\n\\n3\\n The § 924(c) counts on which the two were convicted recited as predicate felonies both the narcotics violations and the assaults on federal officers.  In the courts below the Government attempted to support the § 924(c) convictions in part by arguing that whatever their validity when superimposed on the assault charges, they could validly be grounded on the drug counts.  The Court of Appeals rejected this contention, concluding that the jury might have found the drug conspiracy to have come to an end before the robbery and assault.  587 F.2d, at 584, n. 5, and 588, n. 3.  The Government does not press this argument in this Court, and we accordingly treat the cases as though the § 924(c) charges recited only the assaults on federal officers as predicate felonies.\\n\\n\\n4\\n Title 18 U.S.C. § 111 provides as follows:\\n\"Whoever forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes with any person designated in section 1114 of this title while engaged in or on account of the performance of his official duties, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.\\n\"Whoever, in the commission of any such acts uses a deadly or dangerous weapon, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.\"\\nAmong the persons designated in 18 U.S.C. § 1114 are officers or employees of the Drug Enforcement Administration.\\n\\n\\n5\\n Title 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) provides:\\n\"Whoever—\\n\"(1) uses a firearm to commit any felony for which he may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, or\\n\"(2) carries a firearm unlawfully during the commission of any felony for which he may be prosecuted in a court of the United States[,]\\n\"shall, in addition to the punishment provided for the commission of such felony, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for not less than one year nor more than ten years.  In the case of his second or subsequent conviction under this subsection, such person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for not less than two nor more than twenty-five years and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court shall not suspend the sentence in the case of a second or subsequent conviction of such person or give him a probationary sentence, nor shall the term of imprisonment imposed under this subsection run concurrently with any term of imprisonment imposed for the commission of such felony.\"\\n\\n\\n6\\n For present purposes, §§ 2113 and 111 are fully analogous. Therefore, what Simpson held of the relationship between § 924(c) and the one applies to that section\\'s relationship with the other as well.\\n\\n\\n7\\n Petitioners in Simpson had been sentenced under both enhancement provisions, 435 U.S., at 9, 98 S.Ct., at 911.\\n\\n\\n8\\n Simpson\\'s final paragraph stated in part:  \"Accordingly, we hold that in a prosecution growing out of a single transaction of bank robbery with firearms, a defendant may not be sentenced under both § 2113(d) and § 924(c).\"  Id., at 16, 98 S.Ct., at 915.\\n\\n\\n9\\n Section 924(c) was enacted as part of the Gun Control Act of 1968 in the wake of the assassinations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.  It clearly was an attempt to take major steps to prevent firearm abuses.  Thus, it is argued, it is unlikely that Congress would have wanted the severe penalties of § 924(c) to be pre-empted by less stringent penalties provided in pre-existing enhancement provisions.\\n\\n\\n10\\n For example, the Government notes that under such a holding a person who breaks into a Post Office in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2115, which contains no enhancement provision, could receive an extra 10 years under § 924(c) for using a gun to shoot the lock off.  In contrast, the sentence of a person who draws a gun and fires a number of shots while robbing a bank could not be enhanced under that provision because the bank robbery statute\\'s enhancement clause would take precedence.  That clause, § 2113(d), permits a sentence of up to 25 years, but even if he had not used a weapon this person could have received 20 years under § 2113(a). Accordingly, the incremental penalty the bank robber can receive for using the firearm is only 5 years as opposed to 10 for the Post Office robber.\\n\\n\\n11\\n This interpretation receives additional support from the fact that the conference Committee chose the Poff version over a Senate proposal which, according to its sponsor, 114 Cong.Rec. 27142 (1968), would have permitted enhancement for the use of a firearm even where the predicate offense contained its own enhancement clause.  H.R.Conf.Rep.No.1956, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 31-32 (1968), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1968, p. 4410.  We recognize, as the Government points out, that the Senate version differed in other respects as well;  but insofar as it points in any direction this chain of events supports reliance on the Poff statement.\\n\\n\\n12\\n Indeed, § 924(c) is itself fairly broad.  It refers to \"firearms,\" a term defined in 18 U.S.C. §§ 921(a)(3) and (4) to include bombs, grenades, rockets, mines, and similar devices in addition to guns.\\n\\n\\n13\\n The disposition in Simpson was to remand for proceedings consistent with the opinion of the Court.  On remand, the Court of Appeals vacated the § 924(c) sentences and approved and affirmed those under § 2113(d)—a disposition that would have been improper were the Government correct in its specificity argument.\\n\\n\\n14\\n Section 924(c) provides for maximum incremental penalties for use of a firearm of 10 years for a first offender and 25 years for a second offender.  Under § 2113, the incremental penalty available for use of a dangerous weapon in the course of an otherwise forceful bank robbery is 5 years (25 years under § 2113(d) less 20 years under § 2113(a)), while the incremental penalty for using a weapon in the course of an otherwise nonviolent robbery is 15 years (25 years less 10 years under § 2113(b)) if the goods taken are worth more than $100 and 24 years (25 years less 1 year) if the goods taken are worth less.  And under 18 U.S.C. § 2114, another statute referred to by Representative Poff, the incremental cost to the defendant of using a gun to assault a person having custody of the mail or property of the United States is 15 years.  Thus, a ruling making § 924(c) pre-emptive would increase some incremental penalties while actually decreasing others.  In contrast, the Poff rule merely leaves these penalties where they were set by Congress in the first place-it makes no existing firearm penalty smaller or larger.\\n\\n\\n15\\n One of the Government\\'s examples is described in n. 10, supra.  The unlikeliness of the hypothetical and the fact that it compares only incremental and not total penalties suggest that the possibility of genuinely troubling comparative sentences may be exaggerated.\\n\\n\\n16\\n Title 18 U.S.C. § 2 provides in relevant part that \"[w]hoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.\"\\n\\n\\n17\\n On these facts, for example, the Government\\'s view would permit Busic—the aider and abettor—to be sentenced under both § 924(c) and § 111—while LaRocca—the triggerman—could be sentenced only under the latter.  That this is so is a product not of our holding in Part II, but of the Government\\'s theory itself.  This is quite clear if one assumes for purposes of argument that LaRocca could have been punished under § 924(c)(1) for using his gun.  Were that the case, Busic, too would have been guilty of that crime as an aider and abettor.  And the Government\\'s argument here would lead to the conclusion that he could also be guilty of violating § 924(c)(2) by carrying his own gun.  In short, while he neither shot now drew his gun, he would have been subject to fully twice the penalties that would have faced his more culpable comrade.\\n\\n\\n18\\n Our result with regard to Busic flows as much from the logic and language of 18 U.S.C. § 2 as from anything peculiar to § 924(c).  Section 2 makes Busic punishable \"as a principal,\" and those words mean what they say.  One consequence is that aiders and abettors may be held vicariously liable \"regardless of the fact that they may be incapable of committing the specific violation which they are charged to have aided and abetted.\" S.Rep. No. 1020, 82d Cong., 1st Sess., 7 (1951) U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.Serv. 1951, pp. 2578, 2583.  Another is that there will inevitably exist cases in which a decision to treat an aider and abettor as a principal may be inconsistent with prosecuting and punishing him as well for some of his individual acts of aiding and abetting.  Phrased differently, once he has been treated as a principal some of his lesser acts in furtherance of the central violation may merge into it.  On these facts, § 2 appears to require that we treat Busic as though he used LaRocca\\'s gun to commit this assault.  It would be incongruous to treat him at the same time as a separate individual punishable as though he had carried a different gun in the course of a different crime.\\n\\n\\n19\\n The Government makes a conditional plea that should we find § 924(c) to be inapplicable to these petitioners we vacate not only the § 924(c) sentences, but also those imposed by the District Court under § 111.  This, the Government urges, would permit that court to resentence petitioners under the enhancement provision of the latter statute.  The argument is that the District Court intended to deal severely with the assaults in question and should not be prevented from doing so by its choice of the incorrect enhancement provision.  The Court of Appeals has not considered this contention in this context and we are reluctant to do so without the benefit of that court\\'s views. Accordingly, we express no opinion as to whether in the particular circumstances of these cases such a disposition would be permissible.\\n\\n\\n*\\n I do not agree with the Court of Appeals that Busic could be given enhanced punishments both for aiding and abetting LaRocca\\'s armed assault on a federal officer, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2, 111, and for unlawfully carrying his own gun while doing so, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(2).  Since Busic was convicted of armed assault \"as a principal\" under the aiding and abetting statute, 18 U.S.C. § 2 he must be viewed as having used LaRocca\\'s gun as well as carried his own in the course of committing the offense;  and, like the Court, ante, at 410-411, I am unpersuaded that § 924(c) authorizes cumulative punishments for the use of one gun and the unlawful carrying of another in a single criminal transaction.  It is my view, therefore, that Busic could have been given an enhanced sentence under either § 924(c)(2) or §§ 2, 111, but not under both.\\n\\n\\n'}]\n",

Schoenecker and Patrick  Brumm, Petitionersv.UNITED STATES.\\nNo. 90-5744.\\nArgued March 26, 1991.\\nDecided May 30, 1991.\\nRehearing Denied Aug. 2, 1991.\\n\\nSee U.S., 112 S.ct 17.\\n\\nSyllabus\\n\\nA pure dose of the hallucinogenic drug LSD is so small that it must be sold to retail customers in a \"carrier\" created by dissolving pure LSD and, inter alia, spraying the resulting solution on paper.  That paper is then cut into \"one-dose\" squares, which users swallow, lick, or drop into a beverage to release the drug.  Petitioners were convicted in the District Court of selling 10 sheets (1,000 doses) of blotter paper containing LSD, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a).  Section 841(b)(1)(B) calls for a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence for the offense of distributing more than one gram of \"a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount\" of LSD.  Although petitioners\\' pure LSD weighed only 50 milligrams, the court included the total weight of the paper and LSD, 5.7 grams, in calculating their sentences, thus requiring the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence.  The 5.7 grams was also used to determine the base offense level under the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual (Sentencing Guidelines). The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioners\\' arguments that the carrier medium\\'s weight should not be included for sentencing purposes, and, alternatively, that construing the statute and the Sentencing Guidelines to require the carrier medium\\'s inclusion would violate the right to equal protection incorporated in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\\n\\nHeld:\\n\\n1. The statute requires the weight of the carrier medium to be included when determining the appropriate sentencing for trafficking in LSD.  Pp. 456-464.\\n(a) Since the statute refers to a \"mixture or substance containing a detectable amount,\" the entire mixture or substance is to be weighed when calculating the sentence.  This reading is supported by the history of Congress\\' attempts to control illegal drug distribution and by the statute\\'s structure.  Congress knew how to indicate that the weight of a pure drug was to be used to determine a sentence, having done so with respect to PCP and methamphetamine by providing for a mandatory minimum sentence based either on the weight of the mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of the drugs, or on lower weights of the pure drugs.  And Congress clearly intended the dilutant, cutting agent, or carrier medium of heroin and cocaine to be included in those drugs\\' weight for sentencing purposes.  Pp. 456-461.\\n(b) The blotter paper used here, and blotter paper customarily used to distribute LSD, is a \"mixture or substance containing a detectable amount\" of LSD.  Since neither the statute nor the Sentencing Guidelines define \"mixture,\" and it has no established common law meaning, it must be given its ordinary meaning, see Moskal v. United States, 498 U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 461, 468-70, 112 L.Ed.2d 449, which is \"a portion of matter consisting of two or more components . . . that however thoroughly commingled are regarded as retaining a separate existence,\" Webster\\'s Third New International Dictionary.  The LSD crystals left behind when the solvent evaporates are inside of the paper, so they are commingled with it, but the LSD does not chemically combine with the paper and, thus, retains a separate existence. Using the dictionary definition would not allow the clause to be interpreted to include LSD in a bottle or in a car, since, unlike blotter paper, those containers are easily distinguished and separated from LSD.  Nor is there a reason to resort to the rule of lenity to construe the statute in petitioners\\' favor, since a straightforward reading of § 841(b) does not produce a result so absurd or glaringly unjust as to raise a reasonable doubt about Congress\\' intent.  Pp. 461-464.\\n2. This statutory construction is not unconstitutional. Determining the lengths of sentences in accordance with the LSD carrier\\'s weight is not arbitrary and, thus, does not violate due process.  The penalty scheme is intended to punish severely large-volume drug traffickers at any level, and it increases the penalty for such persons by measuring the quantity of the drugs according to their street weight in the diluted form in which they are sold, not their active component\\'s net weight.  Thus, it was rational for Congress to set penalties based on the weight of blotter paper, the chosen tool of the trade for those trafficking in LSD.  Congress was also justified in seeking to avoid arguments about the accurate weight of pure drugs which might have been extracted from the paper if it had chosen to calibrate sentences according to that weight.  And, since the paper seems to be the carrier of choice, the vast majority of cases will do exactly what the sentencing scheme was designed to do—punish more heavily those who deal in larger amounts of drugs.  That distributors with varying degrees of culpability might be subject to the same sentence does not mean that the penalty system for LSD distribution violates due process.  Moreover, the fact that there may be plausible arguments against describing blotter paper impregnated with LSD as a \"mixture or substance\" containing LSD does not mean that the statute is unconstitutionally vague, especially since any debate would center around the appropriate sentence, not the conduct\\'s criminality, and since all but one of the courts that have decided the issue have held that the carrier medium\\'s weight must be included in determining the appropriate sentence.

Chapman, John M. Schoenecker, and Patrick Brumm were convicted of selling 10 sheets (1000 doses) of blotter paper containing LSD, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a). The District Court included the total weight of the paper and LSD in determining the weight of the drug to be used in calculating petitioners\\' sentences.  Accordingly, although the weight of the LSD alone was approximately 50 milligrams, the 5.7 grams combined weight of LSD and blotter paper resulted in the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence of five years required by 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B)(v) for distributing more than one gram of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of LSD.  The entire 5.7 grams was also used to determine the base offense level under the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual (1990) (Sentencing Guidelines).1  Petitioners appealed, claiming that the blotter paper is only a carrier medium, and that its weight should not be included in the weight of the drug for sentencing purposes. Alternatively, they argued that if the statute and Sentencing Guidelines were construed so as to require inclusion of the blotter paper or other carrier medium when calculating the weight of the drug, this would violate the right to equal protection incorporated in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.\\n\\n\\n3\\nThe Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit en banc held that the weight of the blotter paper or other carrier should be included in the weight of the \"mixture or substance containing a detectable amount\" of LSD when computing the sentence for a defendant convicted of distributing LSD.  The Court of Appeals also found that Congress had a rational basis for including the carrier along with the weight of the drug, and therefore the statute and the Sentencing Guidelines did not violate the Constitution.  United States v. Marshall, 908 F.2d 1312 (CA7 1990).  We granted certiorari, 498 U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 579, 112 L.Ed.2d 584 (1990), and now affirm.\\n\\n21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B) provides that\\n\\n4\\n\"any person who violates subsection (a) of this section      [making it unlawful to knowingly or intentionally      manufacture, distribute, dispense, or possess with intent to      manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled      substance], shall be sentenced as follows:\\n\\n\"(1)(B) In the case of a violation of subsection\\n\\n5\\n(a) of this section involving—\\n\\n\\n6\\n.    .    .    .    .\\n\\n\\n7\\n\"(v) 1 gram or more of a mixture or substance containing      a detectable amount of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD);\\n\\n\\n8\\n.    .    .    .    .\\n\\n\\n9\\n\"such person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment      which may not be less than 5 years. . . .\"\\n\\n\\n10\\nSection 841(b)(1)(A)(v) provides for a mandatory minimum of 10 years imprisonment for a violation of subsection (a) involving \"10 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of [LSD].\"  Section 2D1.1(c) of the Sentencing Guidelines parallels the statutory language and requires the base offense level to be determined based upon the weight of a \"mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of\" LSD.\\n\\n\\n11\\nAccording to the Sentencing Commission, the LSD in an average dose weighs 0.05 milligrams;  there are therefore 20,000 pure doses in a gram.  The pure dose is such an infinitesimal amount that it must be sold to retail customers in a \"carrier.\"  Pure LSD is dissolved in a solvent such as alcohol, and either the solution is sprayed on paper or gelatin, or paper is dipped in the solution.  The solvent evaporates, leaving minute amounts of LSD trapped in the paper or gel.  Then the paper or gel is cut into \"one-dose\" squares and sold by the dose.  Users either swallow the squares, lick them until the drug is released, or drop them into a beverage, thereby releasing the drug.  Although gelatin and paper are light, they weigh much more than the LSD.  The ten sheets of blotter paper carrying the 1,000 doses sold by petitioners weighed 5.7 grams;  the LSD by itself weighed only about 50 milligrams, not even close to the one gram necessary to trigger the 5-year mandatory minimum of § 841(b)(1)(B)(v).\\n\\n\\n12\\nPetitioners argue that § 841(b) should not require that the weight of the carrier be included when computing the appropriate sentence for LSD distribution, for the words \"mixture or substance\" are ambiguous, and should not be construed to reach an illogical result.  Because LSD is sold by dose, rather than by weight, the weight of the LSD carrier should not be included when determining a defendant\\'s sentence because it is irrelevant to culpability.  They argue that including the weight of the carrier leads to anomalous results, viz:  a major wholesaler caught with 19,999 doses of pure LSD would not be subject to the 5-year mandatory minimum sentence, while a minor pusher with 200 doses on blotter paper, or even one dose on a sugar cube, would be subject to the mandatory minimum sentence.2  Thus, they contend, the weight of the carrier should be excluded, the weight of the pure LSD should be determined, and that weight should be used to set the appropriate sentence.\\n\\n\\n13\\nWe think that petitioner\\'s reading of the statute—a reading that makes the penalty turn on the net weight of the drug rather than the gross weight of the carrier and drug together—is not a plausible one.  The statute refers to a \"mixture or substance containing a detectable amount.\"  So long as it contains a detectable amount, the entire mixture or substance is to be weighed when calculating the sentence.\\n\\n\\n14\\nThis reading is confirmed by the structure of the statute. With respect to various drugs, including heroin, cocaine, and LSD, it provides for mandatory minimum sentences for crimes involving certain weights of a \"mixture or substance containing a detectable amount\" of the drugs.  With respect to other drugs, however, namely PCP or methamphetamine, it provides for a mandatory minimum sentence based either on the weight of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of the drug, or on lower weights of pure PCP or methamphetamine.  For example, § 841(b)(1)(A)(iv) provides for a mandatory 10-year minimum sentence for any person who distributes \"100 grams or more of phencyclidine (PCP) or 1 kilogram or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of phencyclidine (PCP).\"  Thus, with respect to these two drugs, Congress clearly distinguished between the pure drug and a \"mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of\" the pure drug.  But with respect to drugs such as LSD, which petitioners distributed, Congress declared that sentences should be based exclusively on the weight of the \"mixture or substance.\"  Congress knew how to indicate that the weight of the pure drug was to be used to determine the sentence, and did not make that distinction with respect to LSD.\\n\\n\\n15\\nChapman maintains that Congress could not have intended to include the weight of an LSD carrier for sentencing purposes because the carrier will constitute nearly all of the weight of the entire unit, and the sentence will, therefore, be based on the weight of the carrier, rather than the drug.  The same point can be made about drugs like heroin and cocaine, however, and Congress clearly intended the dilutant, cutting agent, or carrier medium to be included in the weight of those drugs for sentencing purposes.  Inactive ingredients are combined with pure heroin or cocaine, and the mixture is then sold to consumers as a heavily diluted form of the drug.  In some cases, the concentration of the drug in the mixture is very low. E.g., United States v. Buggs, 904 F.2d 1070 (CA7 1990) (1.2% heroin);  United States v. Dorsey, 192 U.S.App.D.C. 313, 591 F.2d 922 (DC 1978) (2% heroin);  United States v. Smith, 601 F.2d 972 (CA8) (2.7% and 8.5% heroin), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 879, 100 S.Ct. 166, 62 L.Ed.2d 108 (1979).  But, if the carrier is a \"mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of the drug,\" then under the language of the statute the weight of the mixture or substance, and not the weight of the pure drug, is controlling.\\n\\n\\n16\\nThe history of Congress\\'s attempts to control illegal drug distribution shows why Congress chose the course that it did with respect to sentencing.  The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Pub.L. 91-513, 84 Stat. 1236, divided drugs by schedules according to potential for abuse.  LSD was listed in schedule I(c), which listed \"any material, compound, mixture, or preparation, which contains any quantity of the following hallucinogenic substances,\" including LSD.  Pub.L. 91-513, § 202(c).  That law did not link penalties to the quantity of the drug possessed;  penalties instead depended upon whether the drug was classified as a narcotic or not.\\n\\n\\n17\\nThe Controlled Substances Penalties Amendments Act of 1984, which was a chapter of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, Pub.L. 98-473, 98 Stat. 2068, first made punishment dependent upon the quantity of the controlled substance involved. The maximum sentence for distribution of 5 grams or more of LSD was set at 20 years.  21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(iv) (1982 ED., Supp. II).  The 1984 amendments were intended \"to provide a more rational penalty structure for the major drug trafficking offenses,\" S.Rep. No. 98-225, 255 (1983), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1984, pp. 3182, 3437 by eliminating sentencing disparaties caused by classifying drugs as narcotic and non-narcotic.  Id., at 256. Penalties were based instead upon the weight of the pure drug involved.  See United States v. McGeehan, 824 F.2d, 677, 681 (CA8 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1061, 108 S.Ct. 1017, 98 L.Ed.2d 982 (1988).\\n\\n\\n18\\nThe current penalties for LSD distribution originated in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Pub.L. 99-570, 100 Stat. 3207 (1986). Congress adopted a \"market-oriented\" approach to punishing drug trafficking, under which the total quantity of what is distributed, rather than the amount of pure drug involved, is used to determine the length of the sentence.  H.R.Rep. No. 99-845, pt. 1, pp. 11-12, 17 (1986).  To implement that principle, Congress set mandatory minimum sentences corresponding to the weight of a \"mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of\" the various controlled substances, including LSD.  21 U.S.C. §§ 841(b)(1)(A)(i)-(viii) and (B)(i)-(viii).  It intended the penalties for drug trafficking to be graduated according to the weight of the drugs in whatever form they were found—cut or uncut, pure or impure, ready for wholesale or ready for distribution at the retail level.  Congress did not want to punish retail traffickers less severely, even though they deal in smaller quantities of the pure drug, because such traffickers keep the street markets going.  H.R.Rep. No. 99-845, supra, at pt. 1, p. 12.\\n\\n\\n19\\nWe think that the blotter paper used in this case, and blotter paper customarily used to distribute LSD, is a \"mixture or substance containing a detectable amount\" of LSD.  In so holding, we confirm the unanimous conclusion of the Courts of Appeals that have addressed the issue.3  Neither the statute nor the Sentencing Guidelines define the terms \"mixture\" and \"substance,\" nor do they have any established common law meaning. Those terms, therefore, must be given their ordinary meaning.  See Moskal v. United States, 498 U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 461, 468-70, 112 L.Ed.2d 449 (1990).  A \"mixture\" is defined to include \"a portion of matter consisting of two or more components that do not bear a fixed proportion to one another and that however thoroughly commingled are regarded as retaining a separate existence.\"  Webster\\'s Third New International Dictionary 1449 (1986).  A \"mixture\" may also consist of two substances blended together so that the particles of one are diffused among the particles of the other.  9 Oxford English Dictionary 921 (2d ed.1989).  LSD is applied to blotter paper in a solvent, which is absorbed into the paper and ultimately evaporates.  After the solvent evaporates, the LSD is left behind in a form that can be said to \"mix\" with the paper.  The LSD crystals are inside of the paper, so that they are comingled with it, but the LSD does not chemically combine with the paper.  Thus, it retains a separate existence and can be released by dropping the paper into a liquid, or by swallowing the paper itself.  The LSD is diffused among the fibers of the paper.  Like heroin or cocaine mixed with cutting agents, the LSD cannot be distinguished from the blotter paper, nor easily separated from it.  Like cutting agents used with other drugs that are ingested, the blotter paper, gel, or sugar cube carrying LSD can be and often is ingested with the drug.\\n\\n\\n20\\nPetitioner argues that the terms \"mixture\" or \"substance\" cannot be given their dictionary meaning because then the clause could be interpreted to include carriers like a glass vial or an automobile in which the drugs are being transported, thus making the phrase nonsensical.  But such nonsense is not the necessary result of giving the term \"mixture\" its dictionary meaning.  The term does not include LSD in a bottle, or LSD in a car, because the drug is easily distinguished from, and separated from, such a \"container.\"  The drug is clearly not mixed with a glass vial or automobile;  nor has the drug chemically bonded with the vial or car.  It may be true that the weights of containers and packaging materials generally are not included in determining a sentence for drug distribution, but that is because those items are also clearly not mixed or otherwise combined with the drug.\\n\\n\\n21\\nPetitioners argue that excluding the weight of the LSD carrier when determining a sentence is consistent with established principles of statutory construction.  First, they argue that the rule of lenity requires an ambiguous statute of this type to be construed in favor of the defendant.  Petitioners also argue that the statute should be construed to avoid a serious constitutional question and an interpretation of the statute that would require it to be struck down as violating due process.\\n\\n\\n22\\nThe rule of lenity, however, is not applicable unless there is a \"grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the language and structure of the Act,\" Huddleston v. United States, 415 U.S. 814, 831, 94 S.Ct. 1262, 1272, 39 L.Ed.2d 782 (1974), such that even after a court has \" \\'seize[d] every thing from which aid can be derived\\' \" it is still \"left with an ambiguous statute.\"  United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 347, 92 S.Ct. 515, 522, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971) (quoting United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch 358, 386, 2 L.Ed. 304 (1805)).  \"The rule [of lenity] comes into operation at the end of the process of construing what Congress has expressed, not at the beginning as an overriding consideration of being lenient to wrongdoers.\"  Callanan v. United States, 364 U.S. 587, 596, 81 S.Ct. 321, 326, 5 L.Ed.2d 312 (1961).  See also, e.g., Moskal v. United States, supra, 498 U.S., at ----, 111 S.Ct., at ----.  The statutory language and structure indicate that the weight of a carrier should be included as a \"mixture or substance containing a detectable amount\" of LSD when determining the sentence for an LSD distributor.  A straightforward reading of § 841(b) does not produce a result \"so \\'absurd or glaringly unjust,\\' \" United States v. Rodgers, 466 U.S. 475, 484, 104 S.Ct. 1942, 1948, 80 L.Ed.2d 492 (1984) (citation omitted), as to raise a \"reasonable doubt\" about Congress\\'s intent.  Moskal v. United States, supra.  There is no reason to resort to the rule of lenity in these circumstances.4\\n\\n\\n23\\nPetitioners also argue that constructions which cast doubt on a statute\\'s constitutionality should be avoided, citing Public Citizen v. United States Dept. of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 465-466, 109 S.Ct. 2558, 2572, 105 L.Ed.2d 377 (1989).  \" \\'[E]very reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality,\\' \" Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building and Construction Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568, 575, 108 S.Ct. 1392, 1397, 99 L.Ed.2d 645 (1988), but reading \"mixture\" to include blotter paper impregnated with LSD crystals is not only a reasonable construction of § 841(b), but it is one that does not raise \"grave doubts\" about the constitutionality of the provision.  United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, 241 U.S. 394, 401, 36 S.Ct. 658, 659, 60 L.Ed. 1061 (1916). The canon of construction that a court should strive to interpret a statute in a way that will avoid an unconstitutional construction is useful in close cases, but it is \" \\'not a license for the judiciary to rewrite language enacted by the legislature.\\' \"  United States v. Monsanto, 491 U.S. 600, 611, 109 S.Ct. 2657, 2664, 105 L.Ed.2d 512 (1989).  Petitioners\\' argument is unavailing here for the reasons we explain below.\\n\\n\\n24\\nPetitioners argue that the due process of law guaranteed them by the Fifth Amendment is violated by determining the lengths of their sentences in accordance with the weight of the LSD \"carrier,\" a factor which they insist is arbitrary.  They argue preliminarily that the right to be free from deprivations of liberty as a result of arbitrary sentences is fundamental, and therefore the statutory provision at issue may be upheld only if the government has a compelling interest in the classification in question.  But we have never subjected the criminal process to this sort of truncated analysis, and we decline to do so now.  Every person has a fundamental right to liberty in the sense that the Government may not punish him unless and until it proves his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at a criminal trial conducted in accordance with the relevant constitutional guarantees.  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535, 536, and n. 16, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1871, 1872, and n. 16 (1979).  But a person who has been so convicted is eligible for, and the court may impose, whatever punishment is authorized by statute for his offense, so long as that penalty is not cruel and unusual, McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79, 92, n. 8, 106 S.Ct. 2411, 2419, n. 8, 91 L.Ed.2d 67 (1986);  Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 224, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 2538, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976), and so long as the penalty is not based on an arbitrary distinction that would violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  In this context, as we noted in Jones v. United States, 463 U.S. 354, 362, n. 10, 103 S.Ct. 3043, 3048, n. 10, 77 L.Ed.2d 694 (1983), an argument based on equal protection essentially duplicates an argument based on due process.\\n\\n\\n25\\nWe find that Congress had a rational basis for its choice of penalties for LSD distribution.  The penalty scheme set out in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 is intended to punish severely large-volume drug traffickers at any level.  H.R.Rep. No. 99-845, Pt. 1, at 12, 17.  It assigns more severe penalties to the distribution of larger quantities of drugs.  By measuring the quantity of the drugs according to the \"street weight\" of the drugs in the diluted form in which they are sold, rather than according to the net weight of the active component, the statute and the Sentencing Guidelines increase the penalty for persons who possess large quantities of drugs, regardless of their purity. That is a rational sentencing scheme.5\\n\\n\\n26\\nThis is as true with respect to LSD as it is with respect to other drugs.  Although LSD is not sold by weight, but by dose, and a carrier medium is not, strictly speaking, used to \"dilute\" the drug, that medium is used to facilitate the distribution of the drug.  Blotter paper makes LSD easier to transport, store, conceal, and sell.  It is a tool of the trade for those who traffic in the drug, and therefore it was rational for Congress to set penalties based on this chosen tool.  Congress was also justified in seeking to avoid arguments about the accurate weight of pure drugs which might have been extracted from blotter paper had it chosen to calibrate sentences according to that weight.\\n\\n\\n27\\nPetitioners do not claim that the sentencing scheme at issue here has actually produced an arbitrary array of sentences, nor did their motions in district court contain any proof of actual disparities in sentencing.  Rather, they challenge the Act on its face on the ground that it will inevitably lead to arbitrary punishments.  While hypothetical cases can be imagined involving very heavy carriers and very little LSD, those cases are of no import in considering a claim by persons such as petitioners, who used a standard LSD carrier.  Blotter paper seems to be the carrier of choice, and the vast majority of cases will therefore do exactly what the sentencing scheme was designed to do—punish more heavily those who deal in larger amounts of drugs.\\n\\n\\n28\\nPetitioners argue that those selling different numbers of doses, and, therefore, with different degrees of culpability, will be subject to the same minimum sentence because of choosing different carriers.6  The same objection could be made to a statute that imposed a fixed sentence for distributing any quantity of LSD, in any form, with any carrier. Such a sentencing scheme—not considering individual degrees of culpability—would clearly be constitutional.  Congress has the power to define criminal punishments without giving the courts any sentencing discretion.  Ex parte United States, 242 U.S. 27, 37 S.Ct. 72, 61 L.Ed. 129 (1916).  Determinate sentences were found in this country\\'s penal codes from its inception, see United States v. Grayson, 438 U.S. 41, 45-46, 98 S.Ct. 2610, 2613-2614, 57 L.Ed.2d 582 (1978), and some have remained until the present. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 1111 (mandatory life imprisonment under federal first-degree-murder statute);  21 U.S.C. § 848(b) (mandatory life imprisonment for violation of drug \"super-kingpin\" statute);  18 U.S.C. § 2114 (1982 Ed.) (flat 25-year sentence for armed robbery of a postal carrier) (upheld against due process challenge in United States v. Smith, 602 F.2d 834 (CA8), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 902, 100 S.Ct. 215, 62 L.Ed.2d 139 (1979), and Smith v. United States, 284 F.2d 789, 791 (CA5 1960)).  A sentencing scheme providing for \"individualized sentences rests not on constitutional commands, but on public policy enacted into statutes.\"  Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 604-605, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 2964-2965, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978) (plurality opinion).  See also Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 364, 109 S.Ct. 647, 650, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989).  That distributors of varying degrees of culpability might be subject to the same sentence does not mean that the penalty system for LSD distribution is unconstitutional.\\n\\n\\n29\\nWe likewise hold that the statute is not unconstitutionally vague.  First Amendment freedoms are not infringed by § 841, so the vagueness claim must be evaluated as the statute is applied to the facts of this case.  United States v. Powell, 423 U.S. 87, 92, 96 S.Ct. 316, 319, 46 L.Ed.2d 228 (1975).  The fact that there may be plausible arguments against describing blotter paper impregnated with LSD as a \"mixture or substance\" containing LSD does not mean that the statute is vague.  This is particularly so since whatever debate there is would center around the appropriate sentence, and not the criminality of the conduct.  We upheld the defendant\\'s conviction in United States v. Rodgers, 466 U.S. 475, 104 S.Ct. 1942, 80 L.Ed.2d 492 (1984), even though the Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the defendant had resided had construed the statute as not applying to one in his position.  Here, on the contrary, all of the Courts of Appeals that have decided the issue, and all except one district court, United States v. Healy, 729 F.Supp. 140 (DC 1990), have held that the weight of the carrier medium must be included in determining the appropriate sentence.\\n\\n\\n30\\nWe hold that the statute requires the weight of the carrier medium to be included when determining the appropriate sentence for trafficking in LSD, and this construction is neither a violation of due process, nor unconstitutionally vague. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is\\n\\n\\n31\\n\\nAffirmed.\\n\\n\\n\\n32\\nJustice STEVENS, with whom Justice MARSHALL joins, dissenting.\\n\\n\\n33\\nThe consequences of the majority\\'s construction of 21 U.S.C. § 841 are so bizarre that I cannot believe they were intended by Congress.  Neither the ambiguous language of the statute, nor its sparse legislative history, supports the interpretation reached by the majority today.  Indeed, the majority\\'s construction of the statute will necessarily produce sentences that are so anomalous that they will undermine the very uniformity that Congress sought to achieve when it adopted the Sentencing Guidelines.\\n\\n\\n34\\nThis was the conclusion reached by five Circuit judges in their two opinions dissenting from the holding of the majority of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit sitting en banc in this case.1  In one of the dissenting opinions, Judge Cummings pointed out that there is no evidence that Congress intended the weight of the carrier to be considered in the sentence determination in LSD cases, and that there is good reason to believe Congress was unaware of the inequitable consequences of the Court\\'s interpretation of the statute.  United States v. Marshall, 908 F.2d 1312, 1327-1328 (CA7 1990).  As Judge Posner noted in the other dissenting opinion, the severity of the sentences in LSD cases would be comparable to those in other drug cases only if the weight of the LSD carrier were disregarded. Id., at 1335.\\n\\n\\n35\\nIf we begin with the language of the statute,2 as did those judges who dissented from the Seventh Circuit\\'s en banc decision, it becomes immediately apparent that the phrase \"mixture or substance\" is far from clear.  As the majority notes, neither the statute3 nor the Sentencing Guidelines4 define the terms \"mixture\" or \"substance.\"  Ante, at 461-462.  The majority initially resists identifying the LSD and carrier as either a mixture or a substance;  instead, it simply refers to the combination, using the language of the statute, as a \"mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of the drug.\"  See ante, at 459, 460, 461.  Eventually, however, the majority does identify the combination as a mixture:  \"After the solvent evaporates, the LSD is left behind in a form that can be said to \\'mix\\' with the paper.  The LSD crystals are inside the paper, so that they are commingled with it, but the LSD does not chemically combine with the paper.\"  Ante, at 462.5  Although it is true that ink which is absorbed by a blotter \"can be said to \\'mix\\' with the paper,\" ibid., I would not describe a used blotter as a \"mixture\" of ink and paper.  So here, I do not believe the word \"mixture\" comfortably describes the relatively large blotter which carries the grains of LSD that adhere to its surface.6\\n\\n\\n36\\nBecause I do not believe that the term \"mixture\" encompasses the LSD and carrier at issue here, and because I, like the majority, do not think that the term \"substance\" describes the combination any more accurately, I turn to the legislative history to see if it provides any guidance as to congressional intent or purpose.  As the Seventh Circuit observed, the legislative history is sparse, and the only reference to LSD in the debates preceding the passage of the 1986 amendments to § 841 was a reference that addresses neither quantities nor weights of drugs.  908 F.2d, at 1327;  see also 132 Cong.Rec. S14030 (Sept. 27, 1986) (statement of Sen. Harkin).\\n\\n\\n37\\nPerhaps more telling in this case is the subsequent legislative history.7  In a letter to Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr., dated April 26, 1989, the Chairman of the Sentencing Commission, William W. Wilkens, Jr., commented on the ambiguity of the statute:\\n\\n\\n38\\n\" \\'With respect to LSD, it is unclear whether Congress      intended the carrier to be considered as a packaging      material, or, since it is commonly consumed along with the      illicit drug, as a dilutant ingredient in the drug mixture. .      . .  The Commission suggests that Congress may wish to      further consider the LSD carrier issue in order to clarify      legislative intent as to whether the weight of the carrier      should or should not be considered in determining the      quantity of LSD mixture for punishment purposes.\\' \"  908      F.2d, at 1327-1328.\\n\\n\\n39\\nPresumably in response, Senator Biden offered a technical amendment, the purpose of which was to correct an inequity that had become apparent from several recent court decisions.8 According to Senator Biden, \"[t]he amendment remedies this inequity by removing the weight of the carrier from the calculation of the weight of the mixture or substance.\"  135 Cong.Rec. S12748 (Oct. 5, 1989).9  Although Senator Biden\\'s amendment was adopted as part of Amendment No. 976 to S. 1711, the bill never passed the House of Representatives.  Senator Kennedy also tried to clarify the language of 21 U.S.C. § 841.  He proposed the following amendment:\\n\\n\\n40\\n\"CLARIFICATION OF \\'MIXTURE OR SUBSTANCE.\\'\\n\\n\\n41\\n\"Section 841(b)(1) of title 21, United States Code, is      amended by inserting the following new subsection at the end      thereof:\\n\\n\\n42\\n\" \\'(E) In determining the weight of a \"mixture or      substance\" under this section, the court shall not include      the weight of the carrier upon which the controlled substance      is placed, or by which it is transported.\\' \"  136 Cong.Rec.      S7069-S7070 (May 24, 1990).\\n\\n\\n43\\nAlthough such subsequent legislation must be approached with circumspection because it can neither clarify what the enacting Congress had contemplated nor speak to whether the clarifications will ever be passed, the amendments, at the very least, indicate that the language of the statute is far from clear or plain.\\n\\n\\n44\\nIn light of the ambiguity of the phrase \"mixture or substance\" and the lack of legislative history to guide us, it is necessary to examine the congressional purpose behind the statute and to determine whether the majority\\'s reading of the statute leads to results that Congress clearly could not have intended. The figures in the Court\\'s opinion, see ante, at 458, n. 2, are sufficient to show that the majority\\'s construction will lead to anomalous sentences that are contrary to one of the central purposes of the Sentencing Guidelines, which was to eliminate disparity in sentencing.  \"Congress sought reasonable uniformity in sentencing by narrowing the wide disparity in sentences imposed for similar criminal offenses committed by similar offenders.\" U.S. Sentencing Comm\\'n, Federal Sentencing Guidelines Manual 1.2 (1991).10  As the majority\\'s chart makes clear, widely divergent sentences may be imposed for the sale of identical amounts of a controlled substance simply because of the nature of the carrier.11  If 100 doses of LSD were sold on sugar cubes, the sentence would range from 188-235 months, whereas if the same dosage were sold in its pure liquid form, the sentence would range only from 10-16 months.  See ante, at 458, n. 2. The absurdity and inequity of this result is emphasized in Judge Posner\\'s dissent:\\n\\n\\n45\\n\"A person who sells LSD on blotter paper is not a worse      criminal than one who sells the same number of doses on      gelatin cubes, but he is subject to a heavier punishment.  A      person who sells five doses of LSD on sugar cubes is not a      worse person than a manufacturer of LSD who is caught with      19,999 doses in pure form, but the former is subject to a      ten-year mandatory minimum no-parole sentence while the      latter is not even subject to the five-year minimum.  If      defendant Chapman, who received five years for selling a      thousand doses of LSD on blotter paper, had sold the same      number of doses in pure form, his Guidelines sentence would      have been fourteen months.  And defendant Marshall\\'s sentence      for selling almost 12,000 doses would have been four years      rather than twenty.  The defendant in United States v. Rose,      881 F.2d 386, 387 (7th Cir.1989), must have bought an      unusually heavy blotter paper, for he sold only 472 doses,      yet his blotter paper weighed 7.3 grams—more than Chapman\\'s,      although Chapman sold more than twice as many doses.      Depending on the weight of the carrier medium (zero when the      stuff is sold in pure form), and excluding the orange juice      case, the Guidelines range for selling 198 doses (the amount      in Dean ) or 472 doses (the amount in Rose ) stretches from      ten months to 365 months;  for selling a thousand doses      (Chapman ), from fifteen to 365 months;  and for selling      11,751 doses (Marshall ), from 33 months to life.  In none of      these computations, by the way, does the weight of the LSD      itself make a difference—so slight is its weight relative to      that of the carrier—except of course when it is sold in pure      form.  Congress might as well have said:  if there is a      carrier, weigh the carrier and forget the LSD.\\n\\n\"This is a quilt the pattern whereof no one has\\n\\n46\\nbeen able to discern.  The legislative history is           silent, and since even the Justice Department cannot           explain the why of the punishment scheme that it is           defending, the most plausible inference is that Congress           simply did not realize how LSD is sold.\"  908 F.2d, at           1333.12\\n\\n\\n47\\nSentencing disparities that have been described as \"crazy,\" ibid., and \"loony,\" id., at 1332, could well be avoided if the majority did not insist upon stretching the definition of \"mixture\" to include the carrier along with the LSD.  It does not make sense to include a carrier in calculating the weight of the LSD because LSD, unlike drugs such as cocaine or marijuana, is sold by dosage rather than by weight.  Thus, whether one dose of LSD is added to a glass of orange juice or to a pitcher of orange juice, it is still only one dose that has been added.  But if the weight of the orange juice is to be added to the calculation, then the person who sells the single dose of LSD in a pitcher rather than in a glass will receive a substantially higher sentence.  If the weight of the carrier is included in the calculation not only does it lead to huge disparities in sentences among LSD offenders, but also it leads to disparities when LSD sentences are compared to sentences for other drugs.  See n. 12, supra ;  908 F.2d, at 1335.\\n\\n\\n48\\nThere is nothing in our jurisprudence that compels us to interpret an ambiguous statute to reach such an absurd result.  In fact, we have specifically declined to do so in the past, even when the statute was not ambiguous, on the ground that Congress could not have intended such an outcome.13  In construing a statute, Learned Hand wisely counseled us to look first to the words of the statute, but \"not to make a fortress out of the dictionary;  but to remember that statutes always have some purpose or object to accomplish, whose sympathetic and imaginative discovery is the surest guide to their meaning.\"  Cabell v. Markham, 148 F.2d 737, 739 (CA2), aff\\'d, 326 U.S. 404, 66 S.Ct. 193, 90 L.Ed. 165 (1945).  In the past, we have recognized that \"frequently words of general meaning are used in a statute, words broad enough to include an act in question, and yet a consideration of . . . the absurd results which follow from giving such broad meaning to the words, makes it unreasonable to believe that the legislator intended to include the particular act.\"  Holy Trinity Church v. United States, 143 U.S. 457, 459, 12 S.Ct. 511, 512, 36 L.Ed. 226 (1892).  These words guided our construction of the statute at issue in Public Citizen v. Department of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 454, 109 S.Ct. 2558, 2566, 105 L.Ed.2d 377 (1989), when we also noted that \"[l]ooking beyond the naked text for guidance is perfectly proper when the result it apparently decrees is difficult to fathom or where it seems inconsistent with Congress\\' intention. . . .\"  Id., at 455, 109 S.Ct., at 2566.\\n\\n\\n49\\nUndoubtedly, Congress intended to punish drug traffickers severely, and in particular, Congress intended to punish those who sell large quantities of drugs more severely than those who sell small quantities.14  But it did not express any intention to treat those who sell LSD differently from those who sell other dangerous drugs.15  The majority\\'s construction of the statute fails to embody these legitimate goals of Congress.  Instead of punishing more severely those who sell large quantities of LSD, the Court would punish more severely those who sell small quantities of LSD in weighty carriers, and instead of sentencing in comparable ways those who sell different types of drugs, the Court would sentence those who sell LSD to longer terms than those who sell proportionately equivalent quantities of other equally dangerous drugs.16  The Court today shows little respect for Congress\\' handiwork when it construes a statute to undermine the very goals that Congress sought to achieve.\\n\\n\\n50\\nI respectfully dissent.\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n Chapman was sentenced to 96 months;  Schoenecker was sentenced to 63 months;  and Brumm was sentenced to 60 months\\' imprisonment.  Brief for Petitioners 4.\\n\\n\\n2\\n Likewise, under the Sentencing Guidelines, those selling the same number of doses would be subject to widely varying sentences depending upon which carrier medium was used.  For example, those selling 100 doses would receive the following disparate sentences:\\nWeight of           Base offense\\nGuidelines\\nCarrier                       100 doses             level      range (months)\\nSugar cube                    227 gr.                36         188-235\\nBlotter paper                 1.4 gr.                26         63-78\\nGelatin capsule                    225 mg.                18              27-33\\n[Pure LSD]                    5 mg.                  12         10-16\"\\nBrief for Petitioners (footnotes omitted).\\nEven among dealers using blotter paper, the sentences can vary because the weight of the blotter paper varies from dealer to dealer.  Petitioners\\' blotter paper, containing 1,000 doses of LSD, weighed 5.7 grams, or 5.7 milligrams per dose.  In United States v. Rose, 881 F.2d 386, 387 (CA7 1989), 472 doses on blotter paper weighed 7.3 grams, or 15.4 milligrams per dose.  In United States v. Elrod, 898 F.2d 60 (CA6 1990), 1,990 doses on blotter paper weighed 11 grams, or 5.5 milligrams per dose.  In United States v. Healy, 729 F.Supp. 140, 141 (DC 1990), 5000 doses on blotter paper weighed 44.133 grams, or 8.8 milligrams per dose.\\n\\n\\n3\\n United States v. Larsen, 904 F.2d 562 (CA10 1990);  United States v. Elrod, 898 F.2d 60 (CA6), cert. denied, 498 U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 104, 112 L.Ed.2d 74 (1990);  United States v. Bishop, 894 F.2d 981, 985-987 (CA8 1990);  United States v.

Taylor, 868 F.2d 125, 127-128 (CA5 1989).\\n\\n\\n4\\n Petitioner points to the views of some members of Congress that the use of the phrase \"mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of LSD\" was less than precise.  These views were manifested by the introduction of bills in the Senate that would have excluded LSD carrier mediums from the \"mixture or substance\" clause.  Neither of the bills was enacted into law, and it is questionable whether they even amount to subsequent legislative history—itself an unreliable guide to legislative intent.  See Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 566-567, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 2550-2551, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988);  Quern v.

See United States v. Mendes, 912 F.2d 434 (CA10 1990);  see United States v. Murphy, 899 F.2d 714, 717 (CA8 1990);  United States v. Bishop, 894 F.2d at 986-987;  United States v.

As it is, almost all distributors choose blotter paper, rather than the heavier and bulkier sugar cubes.\\n\\n\\n1\\n Chief Judge Bauer and Judges Wood, Cudahy and Posner joined Judge Cummings\\' dissent, see United States v. Marshall, 908 F.2d 1312, 1326 (CA7 1990), and all of these judges also joined Judge Posner\\'s dissent.  See id., at 1331.\\n\\n\\n2\\n See United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 580, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2527, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981) (\"In determining the scope of a statute, we look first to its language\").\\n\\n\\n3\\n The statutory definitional section applicable to § 841, 21 U.S.C. § 802, does not define \"mixture or substance.\"\\n\\n\\n4\\n The Guidelines merely provide that \"[u]nless otherwise specified, the weight of a controlled substance set forth in the [offense level] table refers to the entire weight of any mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of the controlled substance.\"  U.S. Sentencing Comm\\'n, Federal Sentencing Guidelines Manual 2.47 (1991).\\n\\n\\n5\\n The majority of the Seventh Circuit also identified the combination as a \"mixture,\" see 908 F.2d, at 1317-1318;  however, other Circuits that have addressed the question have either identified the combination as a substance, see, e.g., United States v. Bishop, 894 F.2d 981, 986 (CA8 1990);  United States v. Daly, 883 F.2d 313, 317 (CA4 1989);  United States v. Taylor, 868 F.2d 125, 127 (CA5 1989), or have simply held that the combination fell within the statutory language of a \"mixture or substance,\" without distinguishing between the two.  See, e.g., United States v. Elrod, 898 F.2d 60, 61 (CA6 1990);  United States v. Larsen, 904 F.2d 562, 563 (CA10 1990).\\n\\n\\n6\\n The point that the \"mixture or substance\" language remains ambiguous is highlighted by the Sentencing Commission\\'s own desire to clarify the meaning of the terms.  A Sentencing Commission Notice, issued on March 3, 1989, invited public comment on whether the Commission should exclude the weight of the carrier for sentencing purposes in LSD cases.  A section in the Guidelines Manual, entitled \"Questions Most Frequently Asked About the Sentencing Guidelines,\" contains a question about the \"mixture or substance\" language, which reflects the Commission\\'s continuing uncertainty as to whether the blotter paper should be weighed:\\n\"With respect to blotter paper, sugar cubes, or other mediums on which LSD or other controlled substances may be absorbed, the Commission has not definitively stated whether the carrier medium is considered part of a drug \\'mixture or substance\\' for guideline application purposes.  In order to ensure consistency between the guidelines and the statute, Application Note 1 to § 2D1.1 states that the term \\'mixture or substance\\' has the same meaning for guideline purposes as in 21 U.S.C. § 841.  Thus, the court must determine whether, under this statute, LSD carrier medium would be considered part of an LSD mixture or substance.  To date, all circuit courts that have addressed the issue appear to be answering the question affirmatively.\"  Federal Sentencing Guidelines Manual, supra, at 599.\\n\\n\\n7\\n Of course subsequent legislative history is generally not relevant and always must be used with care in interpreting enacted legislation.  Compare Sullivan v. Finkelstein, 496 U.S. ----, ---- - ----, n. 8, 110 S.Ct. 2658, 2665-2666, n. 8, 110 L.Ed.2d 563 (1990), with id., at ---- - ----, 110 S.Ct., at 2667 (slip op., at 1-2) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part).  It can, however, provide evidence that an effect of a statute was simply overlooked.\\n\\n\\n8\\n See, e.g., United States v. Bishop, 704 F.Supp. 910 (ND Iowa 1989).\\n\\n\\n9\\n Senator Biden offered the following example to highlight the inequities that resulted if the carrier weight were included in determining the weight of the \"mixture or substance\" of LSD:\\n\"The inequity in these decisions is apparent in the following example.  A single dose of LSD weighs approximately .05 mg.  The sugar cube on which the dose may be dropped for purposes of ingestion and transportation, however, weighs approximately 2 grams.  Under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b) a person distributing more than one gram of a \\'mixture or substance\\' containing LSD is punishable by a minimum sentence of 5 years and a maximum sentence of 40 years.  A person distributing less than a gram of LSD, however, is subject only to a maximum sentence of 20 years.  Thus a person distributing a 1,000 doses of LSD in liquid form is subject to no minimum penalty, while a person handing another person a single dose on a sugar cube is subject to the mandatory five year penalty.\"  135 Cong.Rec. S12748 (Oct. 5, 1989).\\n\\n\\n10\\n \"Sentencing disparities that are not justified by differences among offenses or offenders are unfair both to offenders and to the public.

Marshall, remember, sold fewer than 12,000 doses and was sentenced to twenty years.  Twelve thousand doses sounds like a lot, but to receive a comparable sentence for selling heroin Marshall would have had to sell ten kilograms, which would yield between one and two million doses.  Platt, Heroin Addiction: Theory, Research, and Treatment 50 (2d ed. 1986);  cf. Diamorphine 63, 98 (Scott ed. 1988).  To receive a comparable sentence for selling cocaine he would have had to sell fifty kilograms, which would yield anywhere from 325,000 to five million doses.

The mandatory minimum in\\n creases to 7 years “if the firearm is brandished” and to 10 years “if\\n the firearm is discharged.” §§924(c)(1)(A)(ii), (iii).\\n    Petitioner Dean was convicted of conspiring to commit a bank rob\\n bery and discharging a firearm during an armed robbery. Because\\n the firearm was “discharged” during the robbery, Dean was sen\\n tenced to a 10-year mandatory minimum prison term on the firearm\\n count. §924(c)(1)(A)(iii). On appeal, he contended that the discharge\\n was accidental, and that §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) requires proof that the de\\n fendant intended to discharge the firearm. The Eleventh Circuit af\\n firmed, holding that no proof of intent is required.\\nHeld: Section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) requires no separate proof of intent. The\\n 10-year mandatory minimum applies if a gun is discharged in the\\n course of a violent or drug trafficking crime, whether on purpose or\\n by accident. Pp. 2–9.\\n    (a) Subsection (iii) provides a minimum 10-year sentence “if the\\n firearm is discharged.” It does not require that the discharge be done\\n knowingly or intentionally, or otherwise contain words of limitation.\\n This Court “ordinarily resist[s] reading words or elements into a\\n statute that do not appear on its face.” Bates v. United States, 522\\n U. S. 23, 29. Congress’s use of the passive voice further indicates\\n that subsection (iii) does not require proof of intent. Cf. Watson v.\\n United States, 552 U. S. ___, ___. The statute’s structure also sug\\n gests no such limitation. Congress expressly included an intent re\\n\\x0c2                       DEAN v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                                  Syllabus\\n\\n    quirement for the 7-year mandatory minimum for brandishing a fire\\n    arm by separately defining “brandish” to require that the firearm be\\n    displayed “in order to intimidate” another person. §924(c)(4). Con\\n    gress did not, however, separately define “discharge” to include an in\\n    tent requirement. It is generally presumed that Congress acts inten\\n    tionally when including particular language in one section of a\\n    statute but not in another. Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16,\\n    23. Contrary to Dean’s contention, the phrase “during and in relation\\n    to” in the opening paragraph of §924(c)(1)(A) does not modify “is dis\\n    charged,” which appears in a separate subsection and in a different\\n    voice than the principal paragraph. “[I]n relation to” is most natu\\n    rally read to modify only the nearby verbs “uses” and “carries.” This\\n    reading will not lead to the absurd results posited by Dean. Pp. 3–6.\\n       (b) Dean argues that subsection (iii) must be limited to intentional\\n    discharges in order to give effect to the statute’s progression of\\n    harsher penalties for increasingly culpable conduct. While it is un\\n    usual to impose criminal punishment for the consequences of purely\\n    accidental conduct, it is not unusual to punish individuals for the un\\n    intended consequences of their unlawful acts. The fact that the dis\\n    charge may be accidental does not mean that the defendant is blame\\n    less. The sentencing enhancement accounts for the risk of harm\\n    resulting from the manner in which the crime is carried out, for\\n    which the defendant is responsible. See Harris v. United States, 536\\n    U. S. 545, 553. An individual bringing a loaded weapon to commit a\\n    crime runs the risk that the gun will discharge accidentally. A gun\\n    shot—whether accidental or intended—increases the risk that others\\n    will be injured, that people will panic, or that violence will be used in\\n    response. It also traumatizes bystanders, as it did here. Pp. 6–9.\\n       (c) Because the statutory text and structure demonstrate that the\\n    discharge provision does not contain an intent requirement, the rule\\n    of lenity is not implicated in this case.\\n517 F. 3d 1224, affirmed.\\n\\n   ROBERTS, C.

Sometimes they happen to individu\\nals committing crimes with loaded guns. The question\\nhere is whether extra punishment Congress imposed for\\nthe discharge of a gun during certain crimes applies when\\nthe gun goes off accidentally.\\n                              I\\n   Title 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A) criminalizes using or\\ncarrying a firearm during and in relation to any violent or\\ndrug trafficking crime, or possessing a firearm in further\\nance of such a crime. An individual convicted of that\\noffense receives a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence, in\\naddition to the punishment for the underlying crime.\\n§924(c)(1)(A)(i). The mandatory minimum increases to 7\\nyears “if the firearm is brandished” and to 10 years “if the\\nfirearm is discharged.” §§924(c)(1)(A)(ii), (iii).\\n   In this case, a masked man entered a bank, waved a\\ngun, and yelled at everyone to get down. He then walked\\nbehind the teller counter and started removing money\\nfrom the teller stations. He grabbed bills with his left\\n\\x0c2                   DEAN v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                       Opinion of the Court\\n\\nhand, holding the gun in his right. At one point, he\\nreached over a teller to remove money from her drawer.\\nAs he was collecting the money, the gun discharged, leav\\ning a bullet hole in the partition between two stations.\\nThe robber cursed and dashed out of the bank. Witnesses\\nlater testified that he seemed surprised that the gun had\\ngone off. No one was hurt. App. 16–19, 24, 27, 47–48, 79.\\n   Police arrested Christopher Michael Dean and Ricardo\\nCurtis Lopez for the crime. Both defendants were charged\\nwith conspiracy to commit a robbery affecting interstate\\ncommerce, in violation of 18 U. S. C. §1951(a), and aiding\\nand abetting each other in using, carrying, possessing, and\\ndischarging a firearm during an armed robbery, in viola\\ntion of §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) and §2. App. 11–12. At trial,\\nDean admitted that he had committed the robbery, id., at\\n76–81, and a jury found him guilty on both the robbery\\nand firearm counts. The District Court sentenced Dean to\\na mandatory minimum term of 10 years in prison on the\\nfirearm count, because the firearm “discharged” during\\nthe robbery. §924(c)(1)(A)(iii); App. 136.\\n   Dean appealed, contending that the discharge was\\naccidental, and that the sentencing enhancement in\\n§924(c)(1)(A)(iii) requires proof that the defendant in\\ntended to discharge the firearm. The Court of Appeals\\naffirmed, holding that separate proof of intent was not\\nrequired. 517 F. 3d 1224, 1229 (CA11 2008). That deci\\nsion created a conflict among the Circuits over whether\\nthe accidental discharge of a firearm during the specified\\ncrimes gives rise to the 10-year mandatory minimum. See\\nUnited States v. Brown, 449 F. 3d 154 (CADC 2006) (hold\\ning that it does not). We granted certiorari to resolve that\\nconflict. 555 U. S. ____ (2008).\\n                               II\\n    Section 924(c)(1)(A) provides:\\n      “[A]ny person who, during and in relation to any\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 556 U.

United States, 536 U. S. 545, 552\\n(2002). Subsection (i) “sets a catchall minimum” sentence\\nof not less than five years. Id., at 552–553. Subsections\\n(ii) and (iii) increase the minimum penalty if the firearm\\n“is brandished” or “is discharged.” See id., at 553. The\\nparties disagree over whether §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) contains a\\nrequirement that the defendant intend to discharge the\\nfirearm. We hold that it does not.\\n                               A\\n  “We start, as always, with the language of the statute.”\\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, 431 (2000). The text of\\nsubsection (iii) provides that a defendant shall be sen\\ntenced to a minimum of 10 years “if the firearm is dis\\ncharged.” It does not require that the discharge be done\\nknowingly or intentionally, or otherwise contain words of\\nlimitation. As we explained in Bates v. United States, 522\\nU. S. 23 (1997), in declining to infer an “ ‘intent to de\\nfraud’ ” requirement into a statute, “we ordinarily resist\\nreading words or elements into a statute that do not ap\\npear on its face.” Id., at 29.\\n  Congress’s use of the passive voice further indicates that\\nsubsection (iii) does not require proof of intent. The pas\\n\\x0c4                 DEAN v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                     Opinion of the Court\\n\\nsive voice focuses on an event that occurs without respect\\nto a specific actor, and therefore without respect to any\\nactor’s intent or culpability. Cf. Watson v. United States,\\n552 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 7) (use of passive\\nvoice in statutory phrase “to be used” in 18 U. S. C.\\n§924(d)(1) reflects “agnosticism . . . about who does the\\nusing”). It is whether something happened—not how or\\nwhy it happened—that matters.\\n   The structure of the statute also suggests that subsec\\ntion (iii) is not limited to the intentional discharge of a\\nfirearm. Subsection (ii) provides a 7-year mandatory\\nminimum sentence if the firearm “is brandished.” Con\\ngress expressly included an intent requirement for that\\nprovision, by defining “brandish” to mean “to display all or\\npart of the firearm, or otherwise make the presence of the\\nfirearm known to another person, in order to intimidate\\nthat person.” §924(c)(4) (emphasis added). The defendant\\nmust have intended to brandish the firearm, because the\\nbrandishing must have been done for a specific purpose.\\nCongress did not, however, separately define “discharge”\\nto include an intent requirement. “[W]here Congress\\nincludes particular language in one section of a statute but\\nomits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally\\npresumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely\\nin the disparate inclusion or exclusion.” Russello v. United\\nStates, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal quotation marks\\nomitted).\\n   Dean argues that the statute is not silent on the ques\\ntion presented. Congress, he contends, included an intent\\nelement in the opening paragraph of §924(c)(1)(A), and\\nthat element extends to the sentencing enhancements.\\nSection 924(c)(1)(A) criminalizes using or carrying a fire\\narm “during and in relation to” any violent or drug traf\\nficking crime. In Smith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223\\n(1993), we stated that the phrase “in relation to” means\\n“that the firearm must have some purpose or effect with\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\\n\\n                     Opinion of the Court\\n\\nrespect to the drug trafficking crime; its presence or in\\nvolvement cannot be the result of accident or coincidence.”\\nId., at 238. Dean argues that the adverbial phrase thus\\nnecessarily embodies an intent requirement, and that the\\nphrase modifies all the verbs in the statute—not only use,\\ncarry, and possess, but also brandish and discharge. Such\\na reading requires that a perpetrator knowingly discharge\\nthe firearm for the enhancement to apply. If the discharge\\nis accidental, Dean argues, it is not “in relation to” the\\nunderlying crime.\\n   The most natural reading of the statute, however, is\\nthat “in relation to” modifies only the nearby verbs “uses”\\nand “carries.” The next verb—“possesses”—is modified by\\nits own adverbial clause, “in furtherance of.” The last two\\nverbs—“is brandished” and “is discharged”—appear in\\nseparate subsections and are in a different voice than the\\nverbs in the principal paragraph. There is no basis for\\nreading “in relation to” to extend all the way down to\\nmodify “is discharged.” The better reading of the statute\\nis that the adverbial phrases in the opening paragraph—\\n“in relation to” and “in furtherance of”—modify their\\nrespective nearby verbs, and that neither phrase extends\\nto the sentencing factors.\\n   But, Dean argues, such a reading will lead to absurd\\nresults. The discharge provision on its face contains no\\ntemporal or causal limitations. In the absence of an intent\\nrequirement, the enhancement would apply “regardless of\\nwhen the actions occur, or by whom or for what reason\\nthey are taken.” Brief for Petitioner 11–12. It would, for\\nexample, apply if the gun used during the crime were\\ndischarged “weeks (or years) before or after the crime.”\\nReply Brief for Petitioner 11.\\n   We do not agree that implying an intent requirement is\\nnecessary to address such concerns. As the Government\\nrecognizes, sentencing factors such as the one here “often\\ninvolve . . . special features of the manner in which a basic\\n\\x0c6                 DEAN v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                     Opinion of the Court\\n\\ncrime was carried out.” Brief for United States 29 (quot\\ning Harris, 536 U. S., at 553; internal quotation marks\\nomitted). The basic crime here is using or carrying a\\nfirearm during and in relation to a violent or drug traffick\\ning crime, or possessing a firearm in furtherance of any\\nsuch crime. Fanciful hypotheticals testing whether the\\ndischarge was a “special featur[e]” of how the “basic crime\\nwas carried out,” Harris, 536 U. S., at 553 (internal quota\\ntion marks omitted), are best addressed in those terms,\\nnot by contorting and stretching the statutory language to\\nimply an intent requirement.\\n                              B\\n   Dean further argues that even if the statute is viewed as\\nsilent on the intent question, that silence compels a ruling\\nin his favor. There is, he notes, a presumption that crimi\\nnal prohibitions include a requirement that the Govern\\nment prove the defendant intended the conduct made\\ncriminal. In light of this presumption, we have “on a\\nnumber of occasions read a state-of-mind component into\\nan offense even when the statutory definition did not in\\nterms so provide.” United States v. United States Gypsum\\nCo., 438 U. S. 422, 437 (1978). “[S]ome indication of con\\ngressional intent, express or implied, is required to dis\\npense with mens rea as an element of a crime.” Staples v.\\nUnited States, 511 U. S. 600, 606 (1994).\\n   Dean argues that the presumption is especially strong\\nin this case, given the structure and purpose of the stat\\nute. In his view, the three subsections are intended to\\nprovide harsher penalties for increasingly culpable con\\nduct: a 5-year minimum for using, carrying, or possessing\\na firearm; a 7-year minimum for brandishing a firearm;\\nand a 10-year minimum for discharging a firearm. Incor\\nporating an intent requirement into the discharge provi\\nsion is necessary to give effect to that progression, because\\nan accidental discharge is less culpable than intentional\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 556 U.

See Brown, 449 F. 3d, at 156.\\n   It is unusual to impose criminal punishment for the\\nconsequences of purely accidental conduct.

See United States Sentencing Com\\nmission, Guidelines Manual §2A2.2(b)(3) (Nov. 2008)\\n(USSG) (increasing offense level for aggravated assault\\naccording to the seriousness of the injury); §2D2.3 (in\\ncreasing offense level for operating or directing the opera\\ntion of a common carrier under the influence of alcohol or\\ndrugs if death or serious bodily injury results).\\n   Blackstone expressed the idea in the following terms:\\n    “[I]f any accidental mischief happens to follow from\\n    the performance of a lawful act, the party stands ex\\n    cused from all guilt: but if a man be doing any thing\\n    unlawful, and a consequence ensues which he did not\\n    foresee or intend, as the death of a man or the like, his\\n    want of foresight shall be no excuse; for, being guilty\\n    of one offence, in doing antecedently what is in itself\\n    unlawful, he is criminally guilty of whatever conse\\n    quence may follow the first misbehaviour.” 4 W.\\n    Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England\\n    26–27 (1769).\\nHere the defendant is already guilty of unlawful conduct\\ntwice over: a violent or drug trafficking offense and the\\nuse, carrying, or possession of a firearm in the course of\\nthat offense.

UNITED STATES\\n\\n                     Opinion of the Court\\n\\nunder §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) may be accidental does not mean\\nthat the defendant is blameless. The sentencing en\\nhancement in subsection (iii) accounts for the risk of harm\\nresulting from the manner in which the crime is carried\\nout, for which the defendant is responsible. See Harris,\\nsupra, at 553. An individual who brings a loaded weapon\\nto commit a crime runs the risk that the gun will dis\\ncharge accidentally. A gunshot in such circumstances—\\nwhether accidental or intended—increases the risk that\\nothers will be injured, that people will panic, or that vio\\nlence (with its own danger to those nearby) will be used in\\nresponse. Those criminals wishing to avoid the penalty for\\nan inadvertent discharge can lock or unload the firearm,\\nhandle it with care during the underlying violent or drug\\ntrafficking crime, leave the gun at home, or—best yet—\\navoid committing the felony in the first place.\\n   JUSTICE STEVENS contends that the statute should be\\nread to require a showing of intent because harm resulting\\nfrom a discharge may be punishable under other provi\\nsions, such as the Sentencing Guidelines (but only if “bod\\nily injury” results). Post, at 6 (dissenting opinion) (citing\\nUSSG §2B3.1(b)(3)). But Congress in §924(c)(1)(A)(iii)\\nelected to impose a mandatory term, without regard to\\nmore generally applicable sentencing provisions. Punish\\nment available under such provisions therefore does not\\nsuggest that the statute at issue here is limited to inten\\ntional discharges.\\n   And although the point is not relevant under the correct\\nreading of the statute, it is wrong to assert that the gun\\nshot here “caused no harm.” Post, at 1. By pure luck, no\\none was killed or wounded. But the gunshot plainly added\\nto the trauma experienced by those held during the armed\\nrobbery.

Indeed, if they cause no harm they seldom\\ngive rise to any liability. The Court today nevertheless\\nholds that petitioner is subject to a mandatory additional\\nsentence—a species of criminal liability—for an accident\\nthat caused no harm. For two reasons, 18 U. S. C.\\n§924(c)(1)(A)(iii) should not be so construed. First, the\\nstructure of §924(c)(1)(A) suggests that Congress intended\\nto provide escalating sentences for increasingly culpable\\nconduct and that the discharge provision therefore applies\\nonly to intentional discharges. Second, even if the statute\\ndid not affirmatively support that inference, the common\\nlaw presumption that provisions imposing criminal penal\\nties require proof of mens rea would lead to the same\\nconclusion. Cf. United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc.,\\n513 U. S. 64, 70 (1994). Accordingly, I would hold that the\\nCourt of Appeals erred in concluding that petitioner could\\nbe sentenced under §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) absent evidence that\\nhe intended to discharge his gun.\\n                              I\\n  It is clear from the structure and history of §924(c)(1)(A)\\nthat Congress intended §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) to apply only to\\nintentional discharges. The statute’s structure supports\\n\\x0c2                     DEAN v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\\n\\nthe inference that Congress intended to impose increas\\ningly harsh punishment for increasingly culpable conduct.\\nThe lesser enhancements for carrying or brandishing\\nprovided by clauses (i) and (ii) clearly require proof of\\nintent. Clause (i) imposes a 5-year mandatory minimum\\nsentence for using or carrying a firearm “during and in\\nrelation to” a crime of violence or drug trafficking offense,\\nor possessing a firearm “in furtherance” of such an offense.\\nAs we have said before, the provision’s relational terms\\nconvey that it does not reach inadvertent conduct. See\\nSmith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223, 238 (1993) (“The\\nphrase ‘in relation to’ . . . at a minimum, clarifies that the\\nfirearm must have some purpose or effect with respect to\\nthe drug trafficking crime; its presence or involvement\\ncannot be the result of accident or coincidence”). Simi\\nlarly, clause (ii) mandates an enhanced penalty for bran\\ndishing a firearm only upon proof that a defendant had\\nthe specific intent to intimidate. See §924(c)(4). In that\\ncontext, the most natural reading of clause (iii), which\\nimposes the greatest mandatory penalty, is that it pro\\nvides additional punishment for the more culpable act of\\nintentional discharge.1\\n   The legislative history also indicates that Congress\\nintended to impose an enhanced penalty only for inten\\ntional discharge. In Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137,\\n148 (1995), the Court held that “use” of a firearm for\\npurposes of §924(c)(1) required some type of “active em\\nployment,” such as “brandishing, displaying, bartering,\\nstriking with, and, most obviously, firing or attempting to\\nfire.”    Congress responded to Bailey by amending\\n——————\\n  1 Contrary to the Court’s suggestion, ante, at 4, Congress’ provision of\\n\\na specific intent element for brandishing and not for discharge only\\nsupports the conclusion that Congress did not intend enhancements\\nunder the discharge provision to require proof of specific intent; it\\nsupports no inference that Congress also intended to eliminate any\\ngeneral intent requirement and thereby make offenders strictly liable.\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 556 U.

L. 105–386, §1(2)(1), 112 Stat. 3469; see also 144\\nCong. Rec. 26608 (1998) (remarks of Sen. DeWine) (refer\\nring to the amendments as the “Bailey Fix Act”). Given\\nthe close relationship between the Bailey decision and\\nCongress’ enactment of the brandishing and discharge\\nprovisions, those terms are best read as codifying some of\\nthe more culpable among the “active employments” of a\\nfirearm that the Court identified in Bailey.\\n                             II\\n   Even if there were no evidence that Congress intended\\n§924(c)(1)(A)(iii) to apply only to intentional discharges,\\nthe presumption that criminal provisions include an intent\\nrequirement would lead me to the same conclusion. Con\\nsistent with the common-law tradition, the requirement of\\nmens rea has long been the rule of our criminal jurispru\\ndence. See United States v. United States Gypsum Co.,\\n438 U. S. 422 (1978). The concept of crime as a “concur\\nrence of an evil-meaning mind with an evil-doing hand . . .\\ntook deep and early root in American soil.” Morissette v.\\nUnited States, 342 U. S. 246, 251–252 (1952). Legislating\\nagainst that backdrop, States often omitted intent ele\\nments when codifying the criminal law, and “courts as\\nsumed that the omission did not signify disapproval of the\\nprinciple but merely recognized that intent was so inher\\nent in the idea of the offense that it required no statutory\\naffirmation.” Id., at 252. Similarly, absent a clear state\\nment by Congress that it intended to create a strict\\nliability offense, a mens rea requirement has generally\\nbeen presumed in federal statutes. See id., at 273; Staples\\nv. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 605–606 (1994). With only\\na few narrowly delineated exceptions for such crimes as\\nstatutory rape and public welfare offenses, the presump\\n\\x0c4                  DEAN v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\\n\\ntion remains the rule today. See Morissette, 342 U. S., at\\n251–254, and n. 8; see also Staples, 511 U. S., at 606–607\\n(discussing United States v. Balint, 258 U. S. 250 (1922)).\\n   Although mandatory minimum sentencing provisions\\nare of too recent genesis to have any common-law pedi\\ngree, see Harris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545, 579, 581,\\nn. 5 (2002) (THOMAS, J., dissenting), there is no sensible\\nreason for treating them differently from offense elements\\nfor purposes of the presumption of mens rea. Sentencing\\nprovisions of this type have substantially the same effect\\non a defendant’s liberty as aggravated offense provisions.\\nAlthough a sentencing judge has discretion to issue sen\\ntences under §924(c)(1)(A) within the substantial range\\nbounded on one end by the 5-, 7-, or 10-year mandatory\\nminimum sentence and on the other by the statutory\\nmaximum sentence, judges in practice rarely exercise that\\ndiscretion. As JUSTICE THOMAS noted in Harris, “the\\nsentence imposed when a defendant is found only to have\\n‘carried’ a firearm ‘in relation to’ a drug trafficking offense\\nappears to be, almost uniformly, if not invariably, five\\nyears,” and “those found to have brandished a firearm\\ntypically, if not always, are sentenced only to 7 years in\\nprison while those found to have discharged a firearm are\\nsentenced only to 10 years.” Id., at 578 (dissenting opin\\nion); see also United States Sentencing Commission,\\nGuidelines Manual §2K2.4, comment., n. 2 (Nov. 2008)\\n(USSG) (stating that the minimum sentence required by\\n§924(c)(1)(A) is the guideline sentence and any increase is\\nan upward departure). If anything, imposition of a man\\ndatory minimum sentence under §924(c)(1)(A) will likely\\nhave a greater effect on a defendant’s liberty than will\\nconviction for another offense because, unlike sentences\\nfor most federal offenses, sentences imposed pursuant to\\nthat section must be served consecutively to any other\\nsentence. See §924(c)(1)(D)(ii).\\n   As the foregoing shows, mandatory minimum sentenc\\n\\x0c                     Cite as: 556 U.

The common-law tradition of requiring\\nproof of mens rea to establish criminal culpability should\\nthus apply equally to such sentencing factors. Absent a\\nclear indication that Congress intended to create a strict-\\nliability enhancement, courts should presume that a pro-\\nvision that mandates enhanced criminal penalties re-\\nquires proof of intent. This conclusion is bolstered by the\\nfact that we have long applied the rule of lenity—which is\\nsimilar to the mens rea rule in both origin and purpose—to\\nprovisions that increase criminal penalties as well as\\nthose that criminalize conduct. See United States v.\\nR. L. C., 503 U. S. 291, 305 (1992) (plurality opinion);\\nBifulco v. United States, 447 U. S. 381, 387 (1980); Ladner\\nv. United States, 358 U. S. 169, 178 (1958).2 Accordingly, I\\nwould apply the presumption in this case and avoid the\\nstrange result of imposing a substantially harsher penalty\\nfor an act caused not by an “evil-meaning mind” but by a\\nclumsy hand.\\n   The majority urges the result in this case is not unusual\\nbecause legislatures commonly “punish individuals for the\\nunintended consequences of their unlawful acts,” ante, at\\n7, but the collection of examples that follows this assertion\\n——————\\n  2 To be sure, there are also inquiries for which the Court has said that\\nsentencing provisions are different. In Harris v. United States, 536\\nU. S. 545, 557 (2002) (plurality opinion), and McMillan v. Pennsyl-\\nvania, 477 U. S. 79, 87–88 (1986), the Court distinguished for purposes\\nof constitutional analysis mandatory minimum sentencing schemes\\nfrom offense elements and provisions that increase the statutory\\nmaximum sentence. I continue to agree with JUSTICE THOMAS’ compel-\\nling dissent in Harris, in which he rejected the distinction on the\\nground that mandatory minimum sentencing provisions have at least\\nas significant an effect on a defendant’s liberty as additional convic-\\ntions or statutory maximum provisions. 536 U. S., at 577–578. The\\nlogic of treating these provisions similarly is buttressed by our subse-\\nquent decision in United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 233–234\\n(2005).\\n\\x0c6                 DEAN v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\\n\\nis telling. The Court cites the felony-murder rule, 18\\nU. S. C. §1111, and Sentencing Guidelines provisions that\\npermit increased punishment based on the seriousness of\\nthe harm caused by the predicate act, see USSG\\n§2A2.2(b)(3) (increasing the offense level for aggravated\\nassault according to the seriousness of the injury); §2D2.3\\n(increasing the offense level for operating a common car\\nrier under the influence of alcohol or drugs if death or\\nserious injury results). These examples have in common\\nthe provision of enhanced penalties for the infliction of\\nsome additional harm.         By contrast, §924(c)(1)(A)(iii)\\npunishes discharges whether or not any harm is realized.\\nAdditionally, in each of the majority’s examples Congress\\nor the Sentencing Commission made explicit its intent to\\npunish the resulting harm regardless of the perpetrator’s\\nmens rea. Section 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) contains no analogous\\nstatement. For these reasons, §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) is readily\\ndistinguishable from the provisions the majority cites.\\n   Contrary to the majority’s suggestion, the existence of\\nprovisions that penalize the unintended consequences of\\nfelonious conduct underscores the reasonableness of read\\ning §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) to require proof of intent. When harm\\nresults from a firearm discharge during the commission of\\na violent felony or drug trafficking offense, the defendant\\nwill be punishable pursuant to USSG §2B3.1(b)(3) (in\\ncreasing the offense level for robbery according to the\\nresulting degree of bodily injury), the felony-murder rule,\\nor a similar provision. That a defendant will be subject to\\npunishment for the harm resulting from a discharge\\nwhether or not he is also subject to the enhanced penalty\\nimposed by §924(c)(1)(A)(iii) indicates that the latter\\nprovision was intended to serve a different purpose—\\nnamely, to punish the more culpable act of intentional\\ndischarge.\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 556 U.

Were the statute unclear in that regard, I\\nwould reach the same conclusion by applying the pre\\nsumption that Congress intended to include a mens rea\\nrequirement. Mandatory sentencing provisions are not\\nmeaningfully distinguishable from statutes defining\\ncrimes to which we have previously applied the presump\\ntion; the rule of Morissette and Staples and not the felony\\nmurder rule should therefore guide our analysis.

S. 137, 148 (1995), held that simple\\npossession of a firearm, without some type of “active em\\nployment,” such as “brandishing, displaying, bartering,\\nstriking with, and, most obviously, firing or attempting to\\nfire,” did not constitute “use” of a firearm. See ante, at 2\\n(dissenting opinion). It seems possible, if not likely, that\\nCongress, in this statute, amended then-existing law by\\ncriminalizing the “simple possession” that Bailey found\\ninsufficient and then imposed a set of ever more severe\\nmandatory sentences for the conduct that the Court listed\\nin Bailey when it considered ways in which an offender\\nmight use a firearm. See ante, at 2–3. If so, the statutory\\nwords “is discharged,” 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A)(iii), refer to\\nwhat Bailey called “firing,” and they do not encompass an\\naccidental discharge.\\n   I concede that the Court lists strong arguments to the\\ncontrary. But, in my view, the “rule of lenity” tips the\\nbalance against the majority’s position. The “rule of len\\nity” as ordinarily applied reflects the law’s insistence that\\na criminal statute provide “fair warning . . . of what the\\n\\x0c2                 DEAN v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nlaw intends to do if a certain line is passed.” United States\\nv. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 348 (1971) (internal quotation\\nmarks omitted). But here, where a mandatory minimum\\nsentence is at issue, its application reflects an additional\\nconsideration, namely, that its application will likely\\nproduce an interpretation that hews more closely to Con\\ngress’ sentencing intent.\\n   That is because, in the case of a mandatory minimum,\\nan interpretation that errs on the side of exclusion (an\\ninterpretive error on the side of leniency) still permits the\\nsentencing judge to impose a sentence similar to, perhaps\\nclose to, the statutory sentence even if that sentence (be\\ncause of the court’s interpretation of the statute) is not\\nlegislatively required. See, e.g., United States Sentencing\\nCommission, Guidelines Manual §2B3.1(b)(2) (Nov. 2008)\\n(Specific Offense Characteristics) (possibly calling for a 7\\nto-9 year increase in the sentencing range in a case like\\nthis one). The sentencing judge is most likely to give a low\\nnon-Guidelines sentence in an unusual case—where the\\nnature of the accident, for example, makes clear that the\\noffender was not responsible and perhaps that the dis\\ncharge put no one at risk. See, e.g., Koon v. United States,\\n518 U. S. 81, 92–94 (1996). And, of course, the unusual\\nnature of such a case means it is the kind of case that\\nCongress did not have in mind when it enacted the stat\\nute. Moreover, an error that excludes (erroneously) a set\\nof instances Congress meant to include (such as accidental\\ndischarge) could lead the Sentencing Commission to focus\\non those cases and exercise its investigative and judg\\nmental powers to decide how those cases should be han\\ndled. This investigation would, in turn, make available to\\nCongress a body of evidence and analysis that will help it\\nreconsider the statute if it wishes to do so.\\n   On the other hand, an interpretation that errs on the\\nside of inclusion requires imposing 10 years of additional\\nimprisonment on individuals whom Congress would not\\n\\x0c                Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)          3\\n\\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nhave intended to punish so harshly. Such an interpreta\\ntion would prevent a sentencing court from giving a lower\\nsentence even in an unusual case, for example, where the\\naccident is unintended, unforeseeable, and imposes no\\nadditional risk. And such an interpretation, by errone\\nously taking discretion away from the sentencing judge,\\nwould ensure results that depart dramatically from those\\nCongress would have intended. Cf. Harris v. United\\nStates, 536 U. S. 545, 570 (2002) (BREYER, J., concurring\\nin part and concurring in judgment) (“statutory manda\\ntory minimums generally deny the judge the legal power\\nto depart downward, no matter how unusual the special\\ncircumstances that call for leniency”). Moreover, because\\nsuch unusual cases are (by definition) rare, these errors\\nwould provide little incentive to the Sentencing Commis\\nsion or Congress to reconsider the statute.\\n   These interpretive asymmetries give the rule of lenity\\nspecial force in the context of mandatory minimum provi\\nsions. Because I believe the discharge provision here is\\nsufficiently ambiguous to warrant the application of that\\nrule, I respectfully dissent.\\n\\x0c'}]\n",

S. C. § 924(c)(1)(A), which provides in relevant part that a person who in relation to a drug trafficking crime uses or carries a firearm \"shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime,\" \"(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years; (ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to ... not less than 7 years; and (iii) if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to ... not less than 10 years.\" Because the Government proceeded on the assumption that the provision defines a single crime and that brandishing is a sentencing factor to be found by the judge following trial, the indictment said nothing about brandishing or subsection (ii), simply alleging the elements from the principal paragraph. Petitioner was convicted. When his presentence report recommended that he receive the 7-year minimum sentence, he objected, arguing that brandishing was an element of a separate statutory offense for which he was not indicted or convicted. At the sentencing hearing, the District Court overruled his objection, found that he had brandished the gun, and sentenced him to seven years in prison. Affirming, the Fourth Circuit rejected petitioner\\'s statutory argument and found that McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, foreclosed his argument that if brandishing is a sentencing factor, the statute is unconstitutional under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466. In Apprendi, this Court held that other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum is, in effect, an element of the crime, which must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt (and, in federal prosecutions, alleged in an indictment handed down by a grand jury). But 14 years earlier, McMillan sustained a statute that increased the minimum penalty for a crime, though not beyond the statutory maximum, when the judge found that the defendant had possessed a firearm.\\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\\n243 F. 3d 806, affirmed.\\nJUSTICE KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and IV, concluding: 1. As a matter of statutory interpretation, § 924(c)(1)(A) defines a single offense, in which brandishing and discharging are sentencing factors to be found by the judge, not offense elements to be found by the jury. Pp. 552-556.\\n(a) The prohibition\\'s structure suggests that brandishing and discharging are sentencing factors. Federal laws usually list all offense elements in a single sentence and separate the sentencing factors into subsections. Castillo v. United States, 530 U. S. 120, 125. The instant statute\\'s lengthy principal paragraph lists the elements of a complete crime. Toward the end of the paragraph is the word \"shall,\" which often divides offense-defining provisions from sentence-specifying ones. Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 233. And following \"shall\" are the separate subsections, which explain how defendants are to \"be sentenced.\" Thus this Court can presume that the principal paragraph defines a single crime and its subsections identify sentencing factors. Pp. 552-553.\\n(b) As Jones illustrates, the statute\\'s text might provide evidence to the contrary, but the critical textual clues here reinforce the single-offense interpretation. Brandishing has been singled out as a paradigmatic sentencing factor, Castillo, supra, at 126. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, moreover, brandishing and discharging are factors that affect sentences for numerous crimes. The incremental changes in the minimum penalty at issue here are precisely what one would expect to see in provisions meant to identify matters for the sentencing judge\\'s consideration. Pp. 553-554.\\n(c) The canon of constitutional avoidance — which provides that when a statute is susceptible of two constructions, the Court must adopt the one that avoids grave and doubtful constitutional questions — plays no role here. The constitutional principle that petitioner says a single-offense interpretation of the statute would violate — that any fact increasing the statutory minimum sentence must be accorded the safeguards assigned to elements — was rejected in McMillan. Petitioner\\'s suggestion that the canon be used to avoid overruling one of this Court\\'s own precedents is novel and, given that McMillan was in place when § 924(c)(1)(A) was enacted, unsound. Congress would have had no reason to believe that it was approaching the constitutional line by following the instruction this Court gave in McMillan. Pp. 554-556.\\n2. Reaffirming McMillan and employing the approach outlined in that opinion, the Court concludes that § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) is constitutional. Basing a 2-year increase in the defendant\\'s minimum sentence on a judicial finding of brandishing does not evade the Fifth and Sixth Amendments\\' requirements. Congress simply dictated the precise weight to be given to one traditional sentencing factor. McMillan, supra, at 89-90. Pp. 568-569.\\nJUSTICE KENNEDY, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE O\\'CONNOR, and JUSTICE SCALIA, concluded in Part III that § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) is constitutional under McMillan, which remains sound authority after Apprendi. The Court will not overrule a precedent absent a special justification. The justification offered by petitioner is that Apprendi and McMillan cannot be reconciled. Those decisions are consistent, however, because there is a fundamental distinction between the factual findings at issue in those two cases. Apprendi said that any fact extending the defendant\\'s sentence beyond the maximum authorized by the jury\\'s verdict would have been considered an element of an aggravated crime by the Framers of the Bill of Rights. That cannot be said of a fact increasing the mandatory minimum (but not extending the sentence beyond the statutory maximum), for the jury\\'s verdict has authorized the judge to impose the minimum with or without the finding. This sort of fact is more like the facts judges have traditionally considered when exercising their discretion to choose a sentence within the range authorized by the jury\\'s verdict — facts that the Constitution does not require to be alleged in the indictment, submitted to the jury, or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Read together, McMillan and Apprendi mean that those facts setting the outer limits of a sentence, and of the judicial power to impose it, are elements of the crime for the purposes of the constitutional analysis. Within the range authorized by the jury\\'s verdict, however, the political system may channel judicial discretion — and rely upon judicial expertise — by requiring defendants to serve minimum terms after judges make certain factual findings. Legislatures have relied upon McMillan\\'s holding, and there is no reason to overturn these statutes or cast uncertainty upon sentences imposed under them. Pp. 556-568.\\nJUSTICE BREYER concluded that although Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, cannot easily be distinguished from this case in terms of logic, the Sixth Amendment permits judges to apply sentencing factors — whether those factors lead to a sentence beyond the statutory maximum (as in Apprendi) or the application of a mandatory minimum (as here). This does not mean to suggest approval of mandatory minimum sentences as a matter of policy. Mandatory minimum statutes are fundamentally inconsistent with Congress\\' simultaneous effort to create a fair, honest, and rational sentencing system through the use of the Sentencing Guidelines. They transfer sentencing power to prosecutors, who can determine sentences through the charges they decide to bring, and who thereby have reintroduced much of the sentencing disparity that Congress created the Guidelines to eliminate. Applying Apprendi in this case would not, however, lead Congress to abolish, or to modify, such statutes; and it would take from the judge the power to make a factual determination, while giving that power not to juries, but to prosecutors. The legal consequences of extending Apprendi are also seriously adverse, for doing so would diminish further Congress\\' otherwise broad constitutional authority to define crimes through the specification of elements, to shape criminal sentences through the specification of sentencing factors, and to limit judicial discretion in applying those factors in particular cases.

Legislatures define crimes in terms of the facts that are their essential elements, and constitutional guarantees attach to these facts. In federal prosecutions, \"[n]o person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury\" alleging all the elements of the crime. U. S. Const., Amdt. 5; see Hamling v. United States, 418 U. S. 87, 117 (1974). \"In all criminal prosecutions,\" state and federal, \"the accused shall enjoy the right to ... trial ... by an impartial jury,\" U. S. Const., Amdt. 6; see Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149 (1968), at which the government must prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt, see In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970).\\n\\n\\n2\\nYet not all facts affecting the defendant\\'s punishment are elements. After the accused is convicted, the judge may impose a sentence within a range provided by statute, basing it on various facts relating to the defendant and the manner in which the offense was committed. Though these facts may have a substantial impact on the sentence, they are not elements, and are thus not subject to the Constitution\\'s indictment, jury, and proof requirements. Some statutes also direct judges to give specific weight to certain facts when choosing the sentence. The statutes do not require these facts, sometimes referred to as sentencing factors, to be alleged in the indictment, submitted to the jury, or established beyond a reasonable doubt.\\n\\n\\n3\\nThe Constitution permits legislatures to make the distinction between elements and sentencing factors, but it imposes some limitations as well. For if it did not, legislatures could evade the indictment, jury, and proof requirements by labeling almost every relevant fact a sentencing factor. The Court described one limitation in this respect two Terms ago in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000): \"Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum,\" whether the statute calls it an element or a sentencing factor, \"must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Fourteen years before, in McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986), the Court had declined to adopt a more restrictive constitutional rule. McMillan sustained a statute that increased the minimum penalty for a crime, though not beyond the statutory maximum, when the sentencing judge found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant had possessed a firearm.\\n\\n\\n4\\nThe principal question before us is whether McMillan stands after Apprendi.\\n\\n\\n5\\n* Petitioner William Joseph Harris sold illegal narcotics out of his pawnshop with an unconcealed semiautomatic pistol at his side. He was later arrested for violating federal drug and firearms laws, including 18 U. S. C. § 924(c)(1)(A). That statute provides in relevant part:\\n\\n\\n6\\n\"[A]ny person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime — \"(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years;\\n\\n\\n7\\n\"(ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years; and\\n\\n\\n8\\n\"(iii) if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years.\"\\n\\n\\n9\\nThe Government proceeded on the assumption that § 924(c)(1)(A) defines a single crime and that brandishing is a sentencing factor to be considered by the judge after the trial. For this reason the indictment said nothing of brandishing and made no reference to subsection (ii). Instead, it simply alleged the elements from the statute\\'s principal paragraph: that \"during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime,\" petitioner had \"knowingly carr[ied] a firearm.\" At a bench trial the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina found petitioner guilty as charged.\\n\\n\\n10\\nFollowing his conviction, the presentence report recommended that petitioner be given the 7-year minimum because he had brandished the gun. Petitioner objected, citing this Court\\'s decision in Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227 (1999), and arguing that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, brandishing is an element of a separate offense, an offense for which he had not been indicted or tried. At the sentencing hearing the District Court overruled the objection, found by a preponderance of the evidence that petitioner had brandished the gun, and sentenced him to seven years in prison.\\n\\n\\n11\\nIn the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit petitioner again pressed his statutory argument. He added that if brandishing is a sentencing factor as a statutory matter, the statute is unconstitutional in light of Apprendi — even though, as petitioner acknowledged, the judge\\'s finding did not alter the maximum penalty to which he was exposed. Rejecting these arguments, the Court of Appeals affirmed. 243 F. 3d 806 (2001). Like every other Court of Appeals to have addressed the question, it held that the statute makes brandishing a sentencing factor. Id., at 812; accord, United States v. Barton, 257 F. 3d 433, 443 (CA5 2001); United States v. Carlson, 217 F. 3d 986, 989 (CA8 2000); United States v. Pounds, 230 F. 3d 1317, 1319 (CA11 2000). The court also held that the constitutional argument was foreclosed by McMillan. 243 F. 3d, at 809.\\n\\n\\n12\\nWe granted certiorari, 534 U. S. 1064 (2001), and now affirm.\\n\\nII\\n\\n13\\nWe must first answer a threshold question of statutory construction: Did Congress make brandishing an element or a sentencing factor in § 924(c)(1)(A)? In the Government\\'s view the text in question defines a single crime, and the facts in subsections (ii) and (iii) are considerations for the sentencing judge. Petitioner, on the other hand, contends that Congress meant the statute to define three different crimes. Subsection (ii), he says, creates a separate offense of which brandishing is an element. If petitioner is correct, he was neither indicted nor tried for that offense, and the 7-year minimum did not apply.\\n\\n\\n14\\nSo we begin our analysis by asking what § 924(c)(1)(A) means. The statute does not say in so many words whether brandishing is an element or a sentencing factor, but the structure of the prohibition suggests it is the latter. Federal laws usually list all offense elements \"in a single sentence\" and separate the sentencing factors \"into subsections.\" Castillo v. United States, 530 U. S. 120, 125 (2000). Here, § 924(c)(1)(A) begins with a lengthy principal paragraph listing the elements of a complete crime — \"the basic federal offense of using or carrying a gun during and in relation to\" a violent crime or drug offense. Id., at 124. Toward the end of the paragraph is \"the word `shall,\\' which often divides offense-defining provisions from those that specify sentences.\" Jones, 526 U. S., at 233. And following \"shall\" are the separate subsections, which explain how defendants are to \"be sentenced.\" Subsection (i) sets a catch-all minimum and \"certainly adds no further element.\" Ibid. Subsections (ii) and (iii), in turn, increase the minimum penalty if certain facts are present, and those subsections do not repeat the elements from the principal paragraph.\\n\\n\\n15\\nWhen a statute has this sort of structure, we can presume that its principal paragraph defines a single crime and its subsections identify sentencing factors. But even if a statute \"has a look to it suggesting that the numbered subsections are only sentencing provisions,\" id., at 232, the text might provide compelling evidence to the contrary. This was illustrated by the Court\\'s decision in Jones, in which the federal carjacking statute, which had a similar structure, was interpreted as setting out the elements of multiple offenses.\\n\\n\\n16\\nThe critical textual clues in this case, however, reinforce the single-offense interpretation implied by the statute\\'s structure. Tradition and past congressional practice, for example, were perhaps the most important guideposts in Jones. The fact at issue there — serious bodily injury — is an element in numerous federal statutes, including two on which the carjacking statute was modeled; and the Jones Court doubted that Congress would have made this fact a sentencing factor in one isolated instance. Id., at 235-237; see also Castillo, supra, at 126-127; Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224, 230 (1998). In contrast, there is no similar federal tradition of treating brandishing and discharging as offense elements. In Castillo v. United States, supra, the Court singled out brandishing as a paradigmatic sentencing factor: \"Traditional sentencing factors often involve ... special features of the manner in which a basic crime was carried out (e. g., that the defendant ... brandished a gun).\" Id., at 126. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, moreover, brandishing and discharging affect the sentences for numerous federal crimes. See, e. g., United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual §§ 2A2.2(b)(2), 2B3.1(b)(2), 2B3.2(b)(3)(A), 2E2.1(b)(1), 2L1.1(b)(4) (Nov. 2001). Indeed, the Guidelines appear to have been the only antecedents for the statute\\'s brandishing provision. The term \"brandished\" does not appear in any federal offense-defining provision save 18 U. S. C. § 924(c)(1)(A), and did not appear there until 1998, when the statute was amended to take its current form. The numbered subsections were added then, describing, as sentencing factors often do, \"special features of the manner in which\" the statute\\'s \"basic crime\" could be carried out. Castillo, supra, at 126. It thus seems likely that brandishing and discharging were meant to serve the same function under the statute as they do under the Guidelines.\\n\\n\\n17\\nWe might have had reason to question that inference if brandishing or discharging altered the defendant\\'s punishment in a manner not usually associated with sentencing factors. Jones is again instructive. There the Court accorded great significance to the \"steeply higher penalties\" authorized by the carjacking statute\\'s three subsections, which enhanced the defendant\\'s maximum sentence from 15 years, to 25 years, to life — enhancements the Court doubted Congress would have made contingent upon judicial factfinding. 526 U. S., at 233; see also Castillo, supra, at 131; Almendarez-Torres, supra, at 235-236. The provisions before us now, however, have an effect on the defendant\\'s sentence that is more consistent with traditional understandings about how sentencing factors operate; the required findings constrain, rather than extend, the sentencing judge\\'s discretion. Section 924(c)(1)(A) does not authorize the judge to impose \"steeply higher penalties\" — or higher penalties at all — once the facts in question are found. Since the subsections alter only the minimum, the judge may impose a sentence well in excess of seven years, whether or not the defendant brandished the firearm. The incremental changes in the minimum — from 5 years, to 7, to 10 — are precisely what one would expect to see in provisions meant to identify matters for the sentencing judge\\'s consideration.\\n\\n\\n18\\nNothing about the text or history of the statute rebuts the presumption drawn from its structure. Against the single-offense interpretation to which these considerations point, however, petitioner invokes the canon of constitutional avoidance. Under that doctrine, when \"a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by one of which grave and doubtful constitutional questions arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided, our duty is to adopt the latter.\" United States ex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U. S. 366, 408 (1909). It is at least an open question, petitioner contends, whether the Fifth and Sixth Amendments require every fact increasing a federal defendant\\'s minimum sentence to be alleged in the indictment, submitted to the jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. To avoid resolving that question (and possibly invalidating the statute), petitioner urges, we should read § 924(c)(1)(A) as making brandishing an element of an aggravated federal crime.\\n\\n\\n19\\nThe avoidance canon played a role in Jones, for the subsections of the carjacking statute enhanced the maximum sentence, and a single-offense interpretation would have implicated constitutional questions later addressed — and resolved in the defendant\\'s favor — by Apprendi. See Jones, supra, at 243, n. 6 (\"[A]ny fact (other than prior conviction) that increases the maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt\"). Yet the canon has no role to play here. It applies only when there are serious concerns about the statute\\'s constitutionality, Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 314, n. 9 (1993), and petitioner\\'s proposed rule — that the Constitution requires any fact increasing the statutory minimum sentence to be accorded the safeguards assigned to elements — was rejected 16 years ago in McMillan. Petitioner acknowledges as much but argues that recent developments cast doubt on McMillan\\'s viability. To avoid deciding whether McMillan must be overruled, he says, we should construe the problem out of the statute.\\n\\n\\n20\\nPetitioner\\'s suggestion that we use the canon to avoid overruling one of our own precedents is novel and, given that McMillan was in place when § 924(c)(1)(A) was enacted, unsound. The avoidance canon rests upon our \"respect for Congress, which we assume legislates in the light of constitutional limitations.\" Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173, 191 (1991). The statute at issue in this case was passed when McMillan provided the controlling instruction, and Congress would have had no reason to believe that it was approaching the constitutional line by following that instruction. We would not further the canon\\'s goal of eliminating friction with our coordinate branch, moreover, if we alleviated our doubt about a constitutional premise we had supplied by adopting a strained reading of a statute that Congress had enacted in reliance on the premise. And if we stretched the text to avoid the question of McMillan\\'s continuing vitality, the canon would embrace a dynamic view of statutory interpretation, under which the text might mean one thing when enacted yet another if the prevailing view of the Constitution later changed. We decline to adopt that approach.\\n\\n\\n21\\nAs the avoidance canon poses no obstacle and the interpretive circumstances point in a common direction, we conclude that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, § 924(c)(1)(A) defines a single offense. The statute regards brandishing and discharging as sentencing factors to be found by the judge, not offense elements to be found by the jury.\\n\\nIII\\n\\n22\\nConfident that the statute does just what McMillan said it could, we consider petitioner\\'s argument that § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) is unconstitutional because McMillan is no longer sound authority. Stare decisis is not an \"inexorable command,\" Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 405 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting), but the doctrine is \"of fundamental importance to the rule of law,\" Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 483 U. S. 468, 494 (1987). Even in constitutional cases, in which stare decisis concerns are less pronounced, we will not overrule a precedent absent a \"special justification.\" Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 212 (1984).\\n\\n\\n23\\nThe special justification petitioner offers is our decision in Apprendi, which, he says, cannot be reconciled with McMillan. Cf. Ring v. Arizona, post, at 609 (overruling Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990), because \"Walton and Apprendi are irreconcilable\"). We do not find the argument convincing. As we shall explain, McMillan and Apprendi are consistent because there is a fundamental distinction between the factual findings that were at issue in those two cases. Apprendi said that any fact extending the defendant\\'s sentence beyond the maximum authorized by the jury\\'s verdict would have been considered an element of an aggravated crime — and thus the domain of the jury — by those who framed the Bill of Rights. The same cannot be said of a fact increasing the mandatory minimum (but not extending the sentence beyond the statutory maximum), for the jury\\'s verdict has authorized the judge to impose the minimum with or without the finding. As McMillan recognized, a statute may reserve this type of factual finding for the judge without violating the Constitution.\\n\\n\\n24\\nThough defining criminal conduct is a task generally \"left to the legislative branch,\" Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 210 (1977), Congress may not manipulate the definition of a crime in a way that relieves the Government of its constitutional obligations to charge each element in the indictment, submit each element to the jury, and prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt, Jones, 526 U. S., at 240-241; Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, 699 (1975). McMillan and Apprendi asked whether certain types of facts, though labeled sentencing factors by the legislature, were nevertheless \"traditional elements\" to which these constitutional safeguards were intended to apply. Patterson v. New York, supra, at 211, n. 12.\\n\\n\\n25\\nMcMillan\\'s answer stemmed from certain historical and doctrinal understandings about the role of the judge at sentencing. The mid-19th century produced a general shift in this country from criminal statutes \"providing fixed-term sentences to those providing judges discretion within a permissible range.\" Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 481. Under these statutes, judges exercise their sentencing discretion through \"an inquiry broad in scope, largely unlimited either as to the kind of information [they] may consider, or the source from which it may come.\" United States v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443, 446 (1972). The Court has recognized that this process is constitutional — and that the facts taken into consideration need not be alleged in the indictment, submitted to the jury, or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e. g., United States v. Watts, 519 U. S. 148, 156 (1997) (per curiam); Nichols v. United States, 511 U. S. 738, 747 (1994); Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241, 246 (1949). As the Court reiterated in Jones: \"It is not, of course, that anyone today would claim that every fact with a bearing on sentencing must be found by a jury; we have resolved that general issue and have no intention of questioning its resolution.\" 526 U. S., at 248. Judicial factfinding in the course of selecting a sentence within the authorized range does not implicate the indictment, jury-trial, and reasonable-doubt components of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\\n\\n\\n26\\nThat proposition, coupled with another shift in prevailing sentencing practices, explains McMillan. In the latter part of the 20th century, many legislatures, dissatisfied with sentencing disparities among like offenders, implemented measures regulating judicial discretion. These systems maintained the statutory ranges and the judge\\'s factfinding role but assigned a uniform weight to factors judges often relied upon when choosing a sentence. See, e. g., Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 820 (1991). One example of reform, the kind addressed in McMillan, was mandatory minimum sentencing. The Pennsylvania Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 9712 (1982), imposed a minimum prison term of five years when the sentencing judge found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant had possessed a firearm while committing the crime of conviction.\\n\\n\\n27\\nIn sustaining the statute the McMillan Court placed considerable reliance on the similarity between the sentencing factor at issue and the facts judges contemplate when exercising their discretion within the statutory range. Given that the latter are not elements of the crime, the Court explained, neither was the former:\\n\\n\\n28\\n\"Section 9712 neither alters the maximum penalty for the crime committed nor creates a separate offense calling for a separate penalty; it operates solely to limit the sentencing court\\'s discretion in selecting a penalty within the range already available to it without the special finding of visible possession of a firearm. Section 9712 `ups the ante\\' for the defendant only by raising to five years the minimum sentence which may be imposed within the statutory plan.... Petitioners\\' claim that visible possession under the Pennsylvania statute is `really\\' an element of the offenses for which they are being punished ... would have at least more superficial appeal if a finding of visible possession exposed them to greater or additional punishment, ... but it does not.\" 477 U. S., at 87-88 (footnote omitted).\\n\\n\\n29\\nIn response to the argument that the Act evaded the Constitution\\'s procedural guarantees, the Court noted that the statute \"simply took one factor that has always been considered by sentencing courts to bear on punishment ... and dictated the precise weight to be given that factor.\" Id., at 89-90.\\n\\n\\n30\\nThat reasoning still controls. If the facts judges consider when exercising their discretion within the statutory range are not elements, they do not become as much merely because legislatures require the judge to impose a minimum sentence when those facts are found — a sentence the judge could have imposed absent the finding. It does not matter, for the purposes of the constitutional analysis, that in statutes like the Pennsylvania Act the \"State provides\" that a fact \"shall give rise both to a special stigma and to a special punishment.\" Id., at 103 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Judges choosing a sentence within the range do the same, and \"[j]udges, it is sometimes necessary to remind ourselves, are part of the State.\" Apprendi, supra, at 498 (SCALIA, J., concurring). These facts, though stigmatizing and punitive, have been the traditional domain of judges; they have not been alleged in the indictment or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no reason to believe that those who framed the Fifth and Sixth Amendments would have thought of them as the elements of the crime.\\n\\n\\n31\\nThis conclusion might be questioned if there were extensive historical evidence showing that facts increasing the defendant\\'s minimum sentence (but not affecting the maximum) have, as a matter of course, been treated as elements. The evidence on this score, however, is lacking. Statutes like the Pennsylvania Act, which alter the minimum sentence without changing the maximum, were for the most part the product of the 20th century, when legislatures first asserted control over the sentencing judge\\'s discretion. Courts at the founding (whose views might be relevant, given the contemporaneous adoption of the Bill of Rights, see Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 478-484) and in the mid-19th century (whose views might be relevant, given that sentencing ranges first arose then, see id., at 501-518 (THOMAS, J., concurring)) were not as a general matter required to decide whether a fact giving rise to a mandatory minimum sentence within the available range was to be alleged in the indictment and proved to the jury. See King & Klein, Essential Elements, 54 Vand. L. Rev. 1467, 1474-1477 (2001). Indeed, though there is no clear record of how history treated these facts, it is clear that they did not fall within the principle by which history determined what facts were elements. That principle defined elements as \"fact[s] ... legally essential to the punishment to be inflicted.\" United States v. Reese, 92 U. S. 214, 232 (1876) (Clifford, J., dissenting) (citing 1 J. Bishop, Law of Criminal Procedure § 81, p. 51 (2d ed. 1872)). This formulation includes facts that, as McMillan put it, \"alte[r] the maximum penalty,\" 477 U. S., at 87, but it does not include facts triggering a mandatory minimum. The minimum may be imposed with or without the factual finding; the finding is by definition not \"essential\" to the defendant\\'s punishment.\\n\\n\\n32\\nMcMillan was on firm historical ground, then, when it held that a legislature may specify the condition for a mandatory minimum without making the condition an element of the crime. The fact of visible firearm possession was more like the facts considered by judges when selecting a sentence within the statutory range — facts that, as the authorities from the 19th century confirm, have never been charged in the indictment, submitted to the jury, or proved beyond a reasonable doubt:\\n\\n\\n33\\n\"[W]ithin the limits of any discretion as to the punishment which the law may have allowed, the judge, when he pronounces sentence, may suffer his discretion to be influenced by matter shown in aggravation or mitigation, not covered by the allegations of the indictment. Where the law permits the heaviest punishment, on a scale laid down, to be inflicted, and has merely committed to the judge the authority to interpose its mercy and inflict a punishment of a lighter grade, no rights of the accused are violated though in the indictment there is no mention of mitigating circumstances. The aggravating circumstances spoken of cannot swell the penalty above what the law has provided for the acts charged against the prisoner, and they are interposed merely to check the judicial discretion in the exercise of the permitted mercy. This is an entirely different thing from punishing one for what is not alleged against him.\" Bishop, Criminal Procedure § 85, at 54.\\n\\n\\n34\\nSince sentencing ranges came into use, defendants have not been able to predict from the face of the indictment precisely what their sentence will be; the charged facts have simply made them aware of the \"heaviest punishment\" they face if convicted. Ibid. Judges, in turn, have always considered uncharged \"aggravating circumstances\" that, while increasing the defendant\\'s punishment, have not \"swell[ed] the penalty above what the law has provided for the acts charged.\" Ibid. Because facts supporting a mandatory minimum fit squarely within that description, the legislature\\'s choice to entrust them to the judge does not implicate the \"competition... between judge and jury over ... their respective roles,\" Jones, 526 U. S., at 245, that is the central concern of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\\n\\n\\n35\\nAt issue in Apprendi, by contrast, was a sentencing factor that did \"swell the penalty above what the law has provided,\" Bishop, supra, § 85, at 54, and thus functioned more like a \"traditional elemen[t].\" Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S., at 211, n. 12. The defendant had been convicted of illegal possession of a firearm, an offense for which New Jersey law prescribed a maximum of 10 years in prison. See N. J. Stat. Ann. §§ 2C:39-4(a), 2C:43-6(a)(2) (1995). He was sentenced to 12 years, however, because a separate statute permitted an enhancement when the judge found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant \"acted with a purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race.\" § 2C:44-3(e) (Supp. 2001-2002).\\n\\n\\n36\\nThe Court held that the enhancement was unconstitutional. \"[O]ur cases in this area, and ... the history upon which they rely,\" the Court observed, confirmed the constitutional principle first identified in Jones: \"Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" 530 U. S., at 490. Those facts, Apprendi held, were what the Framers had in mind when they spoke of \"crimes\" and \"criminal prosecutions\" in the Fifth and Sixth Amendments: A crime was not alleged, and a criminal prosecution not complete, unless the indictment and the jury verdict included all the facts to which the legislature had attached the maximum punishment. Any \"fact that ... exposes the criminal defendant to a penalty exceeding the maximum he would receive if punished according to the facts reflected in the jury verdict alone,\" the Court concluded, id., at 483, would have been, under the prevailing historical practice, an element of an aggravated offense. See id., at 479-481; see also id., at 501-518 (THOMAS, J., concurring).\\n\\n\\n37\\nApprendi\\'s conclusions do not undermine McMillan\\'s. There was no comparable historical practice of submitting facts increasing the mandatory minimum to the jury, so the Apprendi rule did not extend to those facts. Indeed, the Court made clear that its holding did not affect McMillan at all:\\n\\n\\n38\\n\"We do not overrule McMillan. We limit its holding to cases that do not involve the imposition of a sentence more severe than the statutory maximum for the offense established by the jury\\'s verdict — a limitation identified in the McMillan opinion itself.\" 530 U. S., at 487, n. 13.\\n\\n\\n39\\nThe sentencing factor in McMillan did not increase \"the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum,\" 530 U. S., at 490; nor did it, as the concurring opinions in Jones put it, \"alter the congressionally prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed,\" 526 U. S., at 253 (SCALIA, J., concurring). As the Apprendi Court observed, the McMillan finding merely required the judge to impose \"a specific sentence within the range authorized by the jury\\'s finding that the defendant [was] guilty.\" 530 U. S., at 494, n. 19; see also Jones, supra, at 242 (\"[T]he Winship issue [in McMillan] rose from a provision that a judge\\'s finding (by a preponderance) of visible possession of a firearm would require a mandatory minimum sentence for certain felonies, but a minimum that fell within the sentencing ranges otherwise prescribed\").\\n\\n\\n40\\nAs its holding and the history on which it was based would suggest, the Apprendi Court\\'s understanding of the Constitution is consistent with the holding in McMillan. Facts extending the sentence beyond the statutory maximum had traditionally been charged in the indictment and submitted to the jury, Apprendi said, because the function of the indictment and jury had been to authorize the State to impose punishment:\\n\\n\\n41\\n\"The evidence ... that punishment was, by law, tied to the offense ... and the evidence that American judges have exercised sentencing discretion within a legally prescribed range ... point to a single, consistent conclusion: The judge\\'s role in sentencing is constrained at its outer limits by the facts alleged in the indictment and found by the jury. Put simply, facts that expose a defendant to a punishment greater than that otherwise legally prescribed were by definition `elements\\' of a separate legal offense.\" 530 U. S., at 483, n. 10.\\n\\n\\n42\\nThe grand and petit juries thus form a \"`strong and two-fold barrier ... between the liberties of the people and the prerogative of the [government].\\'\" Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S., at 151 (quoting W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 349 (T. Cooley ed. 1899)). Absent authorization from the trial jury — in the form of a finding, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, of the facts warranting the extended sentence under the New Jersey statute — the State had no power to sentence the defendant to more than 10 years, the maximum \"authorized by the jury\\'s guilty verdict.\" Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 494. \"[T]hose facts that determine the maximum sentence the law allows,\" then, are necessarily elements of the crime. Id., at 499 (SCALIA, J., concurring).\\n\\n\\n43\\nYet once the jury finds all those facts, Apprendi says that the defendant has been convicted of the crime; the Fifth and Sixth Amendments have been observed; and the Government has been authorized to impose any sentence below the maximum. That is why, as Apprendi noted, \"nothing in this history suggests that it is impermissible for judges to exercise discretion — taking into consideration various factors relating both to offense and offender — in imposing a judgment within the range.\" Id., at 481. That is also why, as McMillan noted, nothing in this history suggests that it is impermissible for judges to find facts that give rise to a mandatory the maximum penalty for the\"minimum sentence below crime committed.\" 477 U. S., at 87-88. In both instances the judicial factfinding does not \"expose a defendant to a punishment greater than that otherwise legally prescribed.\" Apprendi, supra, at 483, n. 10. Whether chosen by the judge or the legislature, the facts guiding judicial discretion below the statutory maximum need not be alleged in the indictment, submitted to the jury, or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. When a judge sentences the defendant to a mandatory minimum, no less than when the judge chooses a sentence within the range, the grand and petit juries already have found all the facts necessary to authorize the Government to impose the sentence. The judge may impose the minimum, the maximum, or any other sentence within the range without seeking further authorization from those juries — and without contradicting Apprendi.\\n\\n\\n44\\nPetitioner argues, however, that the concerns underlying Apprendi apply with equal or more force to facts increasing the defendant\\'s minimum sentence. Those factual findings, he contends, often have a greater impact on the defendant than the findings at issue in Apprendi. This is so because when a fact increasing the statutory maximum is found, the judge may still impose a sentence far below that maximum; but when a fact increasing the minimum is found, the judge has no choice but to impose that minimum, even if he or she otherwise would have chosen a lower sentence. Cf. Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S., at 244-245. Why, petitioner asks, would fairness not also require the latter sort of fact to be alleged in the indictment and found by the jury under a reasonable-doubt standard? The answer is that because it is beyond dispute that the judge\\'s choice of sentences within the authorized range may be influenced by facts not considered by the jury, a factual finding\\'s practical effect cannot by itself control the constitutional analysis. The Fifth and Sixth Amendments ensure that the defendant \"will never get more punishment than he bargained for when he did the crime,\" but they do not promise that he will receive \"anything less\" than that. Apprendi, supra, at 498 (SCALIA, J., concurring). If the grand jury has alleged, and the trial jury has found, all the facts necessary to impose the maximum, the barriers between government and defendant fall. The judge may select any sentence within the range, based on facts not alleged in the indictment or proved to the jury — even if those facts are specified by the legislature, and even if they persuade the judge to choose a much higher sentence than he or she otherwise would have imposed. That a fact affects the defendant\\'s sentence, even dramatically so, does not by itself make it an element.\\n\\n\\n45\\nIn light of the foregoing, it is not surprising that the decisions for the Court in both Apprendi and Jones insisted that they were consistent with McMillan — and that a distinction could be drawn between facts increasing the defendant\\'s minimum sentence and facts extending the sentence beyond the statutory maximum. See, e. g., Apprendi, supra, at 494, n. 19 (\"The term [sentencing factor] appropriately describes a circumstance, which may be either aggravating or mitigating in character, that supports a specific sentence within the range authorized by the jury\\'s finding that the defendant is guilty of a particular offense\"); Jones, 526 U. S., at 242 (\"McMillan, then, recognizes a question under both the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the jury guarantee of the Sixth: ... [M]ay judicial factfinding by a preponderance support the application of a provision that increases the potential severity of the penalty for a variant of a given crime?\"); see also Almendarez-Torres, supra, at 256 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (\"[N]o one can read McMillan ... without perceiving that the determinative element in our validation of the Pennsylvania statute was the fact that it merely limited the sentencing judge\\'s discretion within the range of penalty already available, rather than substantially increasing the available sentence\"). That distinction may continue to stand. The factual finding in Apprendi extended the power of the judge, allowing him or her to impose a punishment exceeding what was authorized by the jury. The finding in McMillan restrained the judge\\'s power, limiting his or her choices within the authorized range. It is quite consistent to maintain that the former type of fact must be submitted to the jury while the latter need not be.\\n\\n\\n46\\nRead together, McMillan and Apprendi mean that those facts setting the outer limits of a sentence, and of the judicial power to impose it, are the elements of the crime for the purposes of the constitutional analysis. Within the range authorized by the jury\\'s verdict, however, the political system may channel judicial discretion — and rely upon judicial expertise — by requiring defendants to serve minimum terms after judges make certain factual findings. It is critical not to abandon that understanding at this late date. Legislatures and their constituents have relied upon McMillan to exercise control over sentencing through dozens of statutes like the one the Court approved in that case. Congress and the States have conditioned mandatory minimum sentences upon judicial findings that, as here, a firearm was possessed, brandished, or discharged, Ala. Code § 13A-5-6(a)(4) (1994); Kan. Stat. Ann. § 21-4618 (1995); Minn. Stat. Ann. § 609.11 (Supp. 2002); N. J. Stat. Ann. §§ 2C:43-6(c), 6(d) (1998); or among other examples, that the victim was over 60 years of age, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 9717(a) (1998); that the defendant possessed a certain quantity of drugs, Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 730, § 5/5-5-3(c)(2)(D) (2000); that the victim was related to the defendant, Alaska Stat. § 12.55.125(b) (2000); and that the defendant was a repeat offender, Md. Ann. Code, Art. 27, § 286 (Supp. 2000). We see no reason to overturn those statutes or cast uncertainty upon the sentences imposed under them.\\n\\nIV\\n\\n47\\nReaffirming McMillan and employing the approach outlined in that case, we conclude that the federal provision at issue, 18 U. S. C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii), is constitutional. Basing a 2-year increase in the defendant\\'s minimum sentence on a judicial finding of brandishing does not evade the requirements of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Congress \"simply took one factor that has always been considered by sentencing courts to bear on punishment ... and dictated the precise weight to be given that factor.\" McMillan, 477 U. S., at 89-90. That factor need not be alleged in the indictment, submitted to the jury, or proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\\n\\n\\n48\\nThe Court is well aware that many question the wisdom of mandatory minimum sentencing. Mandatory minimums, it is often said, fail to account for the unique circumstances of offenders who warrant a lesser penalty. See, e. g., Brief for Families Against Mandatory Minimums Foundation as Amicus Curiae 25, n. 16; cf. Almendarez-Torres, supra, at 245 (citing United States Sentencing Commission, Mandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System 26-34 (Aug. 1991)). These criticisms may be sound, but they would persist whether the judge or the jury found the facts giving rise to the minimum. We hold only that the Constitution permits the judge to do so, and we leave the other questions to Congress, the States, and the democratic processes.\\n\\n\\n49\\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\\n\\n\\n50\\n\\nIt is so ordered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\n\\n*\\n Briefs ofamici curiae urging reversal were filed for the Cato Institute et al. by Stephen P. Halbrook; and for Families Against Mandatory Minimums Foundation by Peter Goldberger and Mary Price.\\nBriefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed for the State of New Jersey et al. by David Samson, Attorney General of New Jersey, and Lisa Sarnoff Gochman, Deputy Attorney General, and by the Attorneys General for their respective jurisdictions as follows: Bruce M.

Hobson.\\n\\n\\n\\n51\\nJUSTICE O\\'CONNOR, concurring.\\n\\n\\n52\\nPetitioner bases his statutory argument that brandishing must be interpreted as an offense element on Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227 (1999). He bases his constitutional argument that regardless of how the statute is interpreted, brandishing must be charged in the indictment and found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt on Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000). As I dissented in Jones and Apprendi and still believe both were wrongly decided, I find it easy to reject petitioner\\'s arguments. Even assuming the validity of Jones and Apprendi, however, I agree that petitioner\\'s arguments that brandishing must be charged in the indictment and found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt are unavailing. I therefore join JUSTICE KENNEDY\\'s opinion in its entirety.\\n\\n\\n53\\nJUSTICE BREYER, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.\\n\\n\\n54\\nI cannot easily distinguish Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), from this case in terms of logic. For that reason, I cannot agree with the plurality\\'s opinion insofar as it finds such a distinction. At the same time, I continue to believe that the Sixth Amendment permits judges to apply sentencing factors — whether those factors lead to a sentence beyond the statutory maximum (as in Apprendi) or the application of a mandatory minimum (as here). And because I believe that extending Apprendi to mandatory minimums would have adverse practical, as well as legal, consequences, I cannot yet accept its rule. I therefore join the Court\\'s judgment, and I join its opinion to the extent that it holds that Apprendi does not apply to mandatory minimums.\\n\\n\\n55\\nIn saying this, I do not mean to suggest my approval of mandatory minimum sentences as a matter of policy. During the past two decades, as mandatory minimum sentencing statutes have proliferated in number and importance, judges, legislators, lawyers, and commentators have criticized those statutes, arguing that they negatively affect the fair administration of the criminal law, a matter of concern to judges and to legislators alike. See, e. g., Remarks of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, Nat. Symposium on Drugs and Violence in America 9-11 (June 18, 1993); Kennedy, Hearings before a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations, 103d Cong., 2d Sess., 29 (Mar. 9, 1994) (mandatory minimums are \"imprudent, unwise and often an unjust mechanism for sentencing\"); Breyer, Federal Sentencing Guidelines Revisited, 14 Crim. Justice 28 (Spring 1999); Hatch, The Role of Congress in Sentencing: The United States Sentencing Commission, Mandatory Minimum Sentences, and the Search for a Certain and Effective Sentencing System, 28 Wake Forest L. Rev. 185, 192-196 (1993); Schulhofer, Rethinking Mandatory Minimums, 28 Wake Forest L. Rev. 199 (1993); Raeder, Rethinking Sentencing and Correctional Policy for Nonviolent Drug Offenders, 14 Crim. Justice 1, 53 (Summer 1999) (noting that the American Bar Association has opposed mandatory minimum sentences since 1974).\\n\\n\\n56\\nMandatory minimum statutes are fundamentally inconsistent with Congress\\' simultaneous effort to create a fair, honest, and rational sentencing system through the use of Sentencing Guidelines. Unlike Guideline sentences, statutory mandatory minimums generally deny the judge the legal power to depart downward, no matter how unusual the special circumstances that call for leniency. See Melendez v. United States, 518 U. S. 120, 132-133 (1996) (BREYER, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); cf. Koon v. United States, 518 U. S. 81, 95-96 (1996). They rarely reflect an effort to achieve sentencing proportionality — a key element of sentencing fairness that demands that the law punish a drug \"kingpin\" and a \"mule\" differently. They transfer sentencing power to prosecutors, who can determine sentences through the charges they decide to bring, and who thereby have reintroduced much of the sentencing disparity that Congress created Guidelines to eliminate. U. S. Sentencing Comm\\'n, Special Report to Congress: Mandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System i-iv, 31-33 (1991) (Sentencing Report); see also Schulhofer, supra, at 214-220. They rarely are based upon empirical study. See Rehnquist, supra, at 9-10; Hatch, supra, at 198. And there is evidence that they encourage subterfuge, leading to more frequent downward departures (on a random basis), thereby making them a comparatively ineffective means of guaranteeing tough sentences. See Sentencing Report 53.\\n\\n\\n57\\nApplying Apprendi in this case would not, however, lead Congress to abolish, or to modify, mandatory minimum sentencing statutes. Rather, it would simply require the prosecutor to charge, and the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of the \"factor,\" say, the amount of unlawful drugs, that triggers the mandatory minimum. In many cases, a defendant, claiming innocence and arguing, say, mistaken identity, will find it impossible simultaneously to argue to the jury that the prosecutor has overstated the drug amount. How, the jury might ask, could this \"innocent\" defendant know anything about that matter? The upshot is that in many such cases defendant and prosecutor will enter into a stipulation before trial as to drug amounts to be used at sentencing (if the jury finds the defendant guilty). To that extent, application of Apprendi would take from the judge the power to make a factual determination, while giving that power not to juries, but to prosecutors. And such consequences, when viewed through the prism of an open, fair sentencing system, are seriously adverse.\\n\\n\\n58\\nThe legal consequences of extending Apprendi to the mandatory minimum sentencing context are also seriously adverse. Doing so would diminish further Congress\\' otherwise broad constitutional authority to define crimes through the specification of elements, to shape criminal sentences through the specification of sentencing factors, and to limit judicial discretion in applying those factors in particular cases. I have discussed these matters fully in my Apprendi dissent. See 530 U. S., at 555. For the reasons set forth there, and in other opinions, see Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 254 (1999) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting); Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998), I would not apply Apprendi in this case.\\n\\n\\n59\\nI consequently join Parts I, II, and IV of the Court\\'s opinion and concur in its judgment.\\n\\n\\n60\\nJUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE SOUTER, and JUSTICE GINSBURG join, dissenting.\\n\\n\\n61\\nThe range of punishment to which petitioner William J. Harris was exposed turned on the fact that he brandished a firearm, a fact that was neither charged in his indictment nor proved at trial beyond a reasonable doubt. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit nonetheless held, in reliance on McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986), that the fact that Harris brandished a firearm was a mere sentencing factor to which no constitutional protections attach. 243 F. 3d 806, 808-812 (2001).\\n\\n\\n62\\nMcMillan, however, conflicts with the Court\\'s later decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), as the dissenting opinion in Apprendi recognized. See id., at 533 (O\\'CONNOR, J., dissenting). The Court\\'s holding today therefore rests on either a misunderstanding or a rejection of the very principles that animated Apprendi just two years ago. Given that considerations of stare decisis are at their nadir in cases involving procedural rules implicating fundamental constitutional protections afforded criminal defendants, I would reaffirm Apprendi, overrule McMillan, and reverse the Court of Appeals.\\n\\n\\n63\\n* Harris was indicted for distributing marijuana in violation of 21 U. S. C. § 841 and for carrying a firearm \"in relation to\" a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U. S. C. § 924(c)(1)(A). Harris pleaded guilty to distributing marijuana but disputed that he had carried a firearm \"in relation to\" a drug trafficking crime. The District Court disagreed,1 and he was convicted by the judge, having waived his right to trial by jury. Although the mandatory minimum prison sentence under § 924(c)(1)(A)(i) is five years in prison, the presentence report relied on § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii), which increases the mandatory minimum prison sentence to seven years when the firearm is brandished.2 At sentencing, the District Court acknowledged that it was a \"close question\" whether Harris \"brandished\" a firearm, and noted that \"[t]he only thing that happened here is [that] he had [a gun] during the drug transaction.\" App. 231-232, 244-247. The District Court nonetheless found by a preponderance of the evidence that Harris had brandished a firearm and as a result sentenced him to the minimum mandatory sentence of seven years\\' imprisonment for the violation of § 924(c)(1)(A).\\n\\n\\n64\\nRelying on McMillan, the Court of Appeals affirmed the sentence and held as a matter of statutory interpretation that brandishing is a sentencing factor, not an element of the § 924(c)(1)(A) offense. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals concluded that the allegation of brandishing a firearm did not need to be charged in the indictment or proved beyond a reasonable doubt in order for the 7-year mandatory minimum to be triggered.\\n\\nII\\n\\n65\\nThe Court construes § 924(c)(1)(A) to \"defin[e] a single offense,\" ante, at 556, rather than the multiple offenses the Court found in a similarly structured statute in Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227 (1999).3 In reliance on McMillan, it then discounts the increasing mandatory minimum sentences set forth in the statutory provision as constitutionally irrelevant. In the plurality\\'s view, any punishment less than the statutory maximum of life imprisonment for any violation of § 924(c)(1)(A) avoids the single principle the Court now gleans from Apprendi: \"`Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum,\\' whether the statute calls it an element or a sentencing factor, `must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\\'\" Ante, at 550 (quoting Apprendi, supra, at 490). According to the plurality, the historical practices underlying the Court\\'s decision in Apprendi with respect to penalties that exceed the statutory maximum do not support extension of Apprendi\\'s rule to facts that increase a defendant\\'s mandatory minimum sentence. Such fine distinctions with regard to vital constitutional liberties cannot withstand close scrutiny.\\n\\n\\n66\\n* The Federal Constitution provides those \"accused\" in federal courts with specific rights, such as the right \"to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation,\" the right to be \"held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime\" only on an indictment or presentment of a grand jury, and the right to be tried by \"an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.\" Amdts. 5 and 6. Also, no Member of this Court disputes that due process requires that every fact necessary to constitute a crime must be found beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury if that right is not waived. See In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970). As with Apprendi, this case thus turns on the seemingly simple question of what constitutes a \"crime.\"\\n\\n\\n67\\nThis question cannot be answered by reference to statutory construction alone solely because the sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum. As I discussed at great length in Apprendi, the original understanding of what facts are elements of a crime was expansive:\\n\\n\\n68\\n\"[I]f the legislature defines some core crime and then provides for increasing the punishment of that crime upon a finding of some aggravating fact — of whatever sort, including the fact of a prior conviction — the core crime and the aggravating fact together constitute an aggravated crime, just as much as grand larceny is an aggravated form of petit larceny. The aggravating fact is an element of the aggravated crime. Similarly, if the legislature, rather than creating grades of crimes, has provided for setting the punishment of a crime based on some fact ... that fact is also an element. No multifactor parsing of statutes, of the sort that we have attempted since McMillan, is necessary. One need only look to the kind, degree, or range of punishment to which the prosecution is by law entitled for a given set of facts. Each fact for that entitlement is an element.\" 530 U. S., at 501 (concurring opinion).\\n\\n\\n69\\nThe fact that a defendant brandished a firearm indisputably alters the prescribed range of penalties to which he is exposed under 18 U. S. C. § 924(c)(1)(A). Without a finding that a defendant brandished or discharged a firearm, the penalty range for a conviction under § 924(c)(1)(A)(i) is five years to life in prison. But with a finding that a defendant brandished a firearm, the penalty range becomes harsher, seven years to life imprisonment. § 924(c)(1)(A)(ii). And if the court finds that a defendant discharged a firearm, the range becomes even more severe, 10 years to life. § 924(c)(1)(A)(iii). Thus, it is ultimately beside the point whether as a matter of statutory interpretation brandishing is a sentencing factor, because as a constitutional matter brandishing must be deemed an element of an aggravated offense. See Apprendi, supra, at 483, n. 10 (\"[F]acts that expose a defendant to a punishment greater than that otherwise legally prescribed were by definition `elements\\' of a separate legal offense\").\\n\\n\\n70\\nI agree with the Court that a legislature is free to decree, within constitutional limits, which facts are elements that constitute a crime. See ante, at 550. But when the legislature provides that a particular fact shall give rise \"`both to a special stigma and to a special punishment,\\'\" ante, at 560 (plurality opinion) (quoting McMillan, 477 U. S., at 103 (STEVENS, J., dissenting)), the constitutional consequences are clear. As the Court acknowledged in Apprendi, society has long recognized a necessary link between punishment and crime, 530 U. S., at 478 (\"The defendant\\'s ability to predict with certainty the judgment from the face of the felony indictment flowed from the invariable linkage of punishment with crime\"). This link makes a great deal of sense: Why, after all, would anyone care if they were convicted of murder, as opposed to manslaughter, but for the increased penalties for the former offense, which in turn reflect the greater moral opprobrium society attaches to the act? We made clear in Apprendi that if a statute \"`annexes a higher degree of punishment\\'\" based on certain circumstances, exposing a defendant to that higher degree of punishment requires that those circumstances be charged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., at 480 (quoting J. Archbold, Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases 51 (15th ed. 1862)).\\n\\n\\n71\\nThis constitutional limitation neither interferes with the legislature\\'s ability to define statutory ranges of punishment nor calls into question judicial discretion to impose \"judgment within the range prescribed by statute.\" Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 481. But it does protect the criminal defendant\\'s constitutional right to know, ex ante, those circumstances that will determine the applicable range of punishment and to have those circumstances proved beyond a reasonable doubt:\\n\\n\\n72\\n\"If a defendant faces punishment beyond that provided by statute when an offense is committed under certain circumstances but not others, it is obvious that both the loss of liberty and the stigma attaching to the offense are heightened; it necessarily follows that the defendant should not — at the moment the State is put to proof of those circumstances — be deprived of protections that have, until that point, unquestionably attached.\" Id., at 484.\\n\\nB\\n\\n73\\nThe Court truncates this protection and holds that \"facts, sometimes referred to as sentencing factors,\" do not need to be \"alleged in the indictment, submitted to the jury, or established beyond a reasonable doubt,\" ante, at 550, so long as they do not increase the penalty for the crime beyond the statutory maximum. This is so even if the fact alters the statutorily mandated sentencing range, by increasing the mandatory minimum sentence. But to say that is in effect to claim that the imposition of a 7-year, rather than a 5-year, mandatory minimum does not change the constitutionally relevant sentence range because, regardless, either sentence falls between five years and the statutory maximum of life, the longest sentence range available under the statute. This analysis is flawed precisely because the statute provides incremental sentencing ranges, in which the mandatory minimum sentence varies upward if a defendant \"brandished\" or \"discharged\" a weapon. As a matter of common sense, an increased mandatory minimum heightens the loss of liberty and represents the increased stigma society attaches to the offense. Consequently, facts that trigger an increased mandatory minimum sentence warrant constitutional safeguards.\\n\\n\\n74\\nActual sentencing practices appear to bolster this conclusion. The suggestion that a 7-year sentence could be imposed even without a finding that a defendant brandished a firearm ignores the fact that the sentence imposed when a defendant is found only to have \"carried\" a firearm \"in relation to\" a drug trafficking offense appears to be, almost uniformly, if not invariably, five years. Similarly, those found to have brandished a firearm typically, if not always, are sentenced only to 7 years in prison while those found to have discharged a firearm are sentenced only to 10 years. Cf. United States Sentencing Commission, 2001 Datafile, USSCFY01, Table 1 (illustrating that almost all persons sentenced for violations of 18 U. S. C. § 924(c)(1)(A) are sentenced to 5, 7, or 10 years\\' imprisonment). This is true even though anyone convicted of violating § 924(c)(1)(A) is theoretically eligible to receive a sentence as severe as life imprisonment.4 Yet under the decision today, those key facts actually responsible for fixing a defendant\\'s punishment need not be charged in an indictment or proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\\n\\n\\n75\\nThe incremental increase between five and seven years in prison may not seem so great in the abstract (of course it must seem quite different to a defendant actually being incarcerated). However, the constitutional analysis adopted by the plurality would hold equally true if the mandatory minimum for a violation of § 924(c)(1) without brandishing was five years, but the mandatory minimum with brandishing was life imprisonment. The result must be the same because surely our fundamental constitutional principles cannot alter depending on degrees of sentencing severity. So long as it was clear that Congress intended for \"brandishing\" to be a sentencing factor, that fact would still neither have to be charged in the indictment nor proved beyond a reasonable doubt. But if this is the case, then Apprendi can easily be avoided by clever statutory drafting.\\n\\n\\n76\\nIt is true that Apprendi concerned a fact that increased the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum, but the principles upon which it relied apply with equal force to those facts that expose the defendant to a higher mandatory minimum: When a fact exposes a defendant to greater punishment than what is otherwise legally prescribed, that fact is \"by definition [an] `elemen[t]\\' of a separate legal offense.\" 530 U. S., at 483, n. 10. Whether one raises the floor or raises the ceiling it is impossible to dispute that the defendant is exposed to greater punishment than is otherwise prescribed.\\n\\n\\n77\\nThis is no less true because mandatory minimum sentences are a 20th-century phenomena. As the Government acknowledged at oral argument, this fact means only that historical practice is not directly dispositive of the question whether facts triggering mandatory minimums must be treated like elements. Tr. of Oral Arg. 47. The Court has not previously suggested that constitutional protection ends where legislative innovation or ingenuity begins. Looking to the principles that animated the decision in Apprendi and the bases for the historical practice upon which Apprendi rested (rather than to the historical pedigree of mandatory minimums), there are no logical grounds for treating facts triggering mandatory minimums any differently than facts that increase the statutory maximum. In either case the defendant cannot predict the judgment from the face of the felony, see 530 U. S., at 478-479, and the absolute statutory limits of his punishment change, constituting an increased penalty. In either case the defendant must be afforded the procedural protections of notice, a jury trial, and a heightened standard of proof with respect to the facts warranting exposure to a greater penalty. See id., at 490; Jones, 526 U. S., at 253 (SCALIA, J., concurring).\\n\\nIII\\n\\n78\\nMcMillan rested on the premise that the \"`applicability of the reasonable-doubt standard ... has always been dependent on how a State defines the offense that is charged in any given case.\\'\" 477 U. S., at 85 (quoting Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 211, n. 12 (1977)). Thus, it cannot withstand the logic of Apprendi, at least with respect to facts for which the legislature has prescribed a new statutory sentencing range. McMillan broke from the \"traditional understanding\" of crime definition, a tradition that \"continued well into the 20th century, at least until the middle of the century.\" Apprendi, supra, at 518 (THOMAS, J., concurring). The Court in McMillan did not, therefore, acknowledge that the change in the prescribed sentence range upon the finding of particular facts changed the prescribed range of penalties in a constitutionally significant way. Rather, while recognizing applicable due process limits, it concluded that the mandatory minimum at issue did not increase the prescribed range of penalties but merely required the judge to impose a specific penalty \"within the range already available to it.\" 477 U. S., at 87-88. As discussed, supra, at 577-579, this analysis is inherently flawed.\\n\\n\\n79\\nJones called into question, and Apprendi firmly limited, a related precept underlying McMillan: namely, the State\\'s authority to treat aggravated behavior as a factor increasing the sentence, rather than as an element of the crime. Although the plurality resurrects this principle, see ante, at 559-560, 565, it must do so in the face of the Court\\'s contrary conclusion in Apprendi, which adopts the position taken by the dissent in McMillan: \"[I]f a State provides that a specific component of a prohibited transaction shall give rise both to a special stigma and to a special punishment, that component must be treated as a `fact necessary to constitute the crime\\' within the meaning of our holding in In re Winship.\" 477 U. S., at 103 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). See Apprendi, supra, at 483-484.\\n\\n\\n80\\nNor should stare decisis dictate the outcome in this case; the stare decisis effect of McMillan is considerably weakened for a variety of reasons. As an initial matter, where the Court has wrongly decided a constitutional question, the force of stare decisis is at its weakest. See Ring v. Arizona, post, at 608; Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 235 (1997). And while the relationship between punishment and the constitutional protections attached to the elements of a crime traces its roots back to the common law, McMillan was decided only 16 years ago.5 No Court of Appeals, let alone this Court, has held that Apprendi has retroactive effect. The United States concedes, with respect to prospective application, that it can charge facts upon which a mandatory minimum sentence is based in the indictment and prove them to a jury. Tr. of Oral Arg. 42. Consequently, one is hard pressed to give credence to the plurality\\'s suggestion that \"[i]t is critical not to abandon\" McMillan \"at this late date.\" Ante, at 567. Rather, it is imperative that the Court maintain absolute fidelity to the protections of the individual afforded by the notice, trial by jury, and beyond-a-reasonable-doubt requirements.\\n\\n\\n81\\nFinally, before today, no one seriously believed that the Court\\'s earlier decision in McMillan could coexist with the logical implications of the Court\\'s later decisions in Apprendi and Jones. In both cases, the dissent said as much:\\n\\n\\n82\\n\"The essential holding of McMillan conflicts with at least two of the several formulations the Court gives to the rule it announces today. First, the Court endorses the following principle: `[I]t is unconstitutional for a legislature to remove from the jury the assessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed. It is equally clear that such facts must be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\\' Ante, at 490 (emphasis added) (quoting Jones, supra, at 252-253 (STEVENS, J., concurring)). Second, the Court endorses the rule as restated in JUSTICE SCALIA\\'s concurring opinion in Jones. See ante, at 490. There, JUSTICE SCALIA wrote: `[I]t is unconstitutional to remove from the jury the assessment of facts that alter the congressionally prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed.\\' Jones, supra, at 253 (emphasis added). Thus, the Court appears to hold that any fact that increases or alters the range of penalties to which a defendant is exposed — which, by definition, must include increases or alterations to either the minimum or maximum penalties — must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. In McMillan, however, we rejected such a rule to the extent it concerned those facts that increase or alter the minimum penalty to which a defendant is exposed. Accordingly, it is incumbent on the Court not only to admit that it is overruling McMillan, but also to explain why such a course of action is appropriate under normal principles of stare decisis.\" Apprendi, 530 U.

HUDDLESTON, Petitioner,v.UNITED STATES.\\nNo. 72-1076.\\nArgued Nov. 7, 1973.\\nDecided March 26, 1974.\\n\\n\\nSyllabus\\n\\nPetitioner, a previously convicted felon, was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. § 922(a)(6), a part of the Gun Control Act of 1968, by falsely stating, in connection with the redemption from a pawnbroker of three guns petitioner had pawned, that he had not been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than a year. The pawnbroker was a federally licensed firearms dealer. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Section 922(a)(6) makes it an offense knowingly to make a false statement 'in connection with the acquisition . . . of any firearm . . . from a . . . licensed dealer' and 'intended or likely to deceive such . . . dealer . . . with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale or other disposition of such firearm . . ..' Held: Section 922(a)(6) applies to the redemption of a firearm from a pawnshop. Pp. 819-833.\\n(a) Petitioner's contention that the statute covers only a sale-like transaction is without merit, since 'acquisition' as used in § 922(a)(6) clearly includes any person, by definition, who 'comes into possession, control, or power of disposal' of a firearm. Moreover, the statutory terms 'acquisition' and 'sale or other disposition' are correlatives. It is reasonable to conclude that a pawnbroker might 'dispose' of a firearm through a redemptive transaction. Finally, Congress explicitly included pawnbrokers in the Gun Control Act, specifically mentioned pledge and pawn transactions involving firearms, and did not include them in the statutory exemptions. Pp. 819-823.\\n(b) That pawnshop firearms redemptions are covered by the challenged provision comports with the legislative history of Title IV of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 and the Gun Control Act of 1968, which are aimed at controlling access to weapons by those whose possession thereof is contrary to the public interest, through a regulatory scheme focusing on the federally licensed firearms dealer. Pp. 824-829.\\n(c) Section 922(a)(6) contains no ambiguity warranting a narrow construction in petitioner's favor, and application of the statute to the pawn redemptions here raises no issue of constitutional dimension. Pp. 830-833.\\n472 F.2d 592, affirmed.\\nHarvey I. Saferstein, Los Angeles, Cal., for the petitioner.\\nDanny Julian Boggs, Bowling Green, Ky., for respondent.\\nMr. Justice BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n\\n\\n1\\nThis case presents the issue whether 18 U.S.C. § 922(a)(6),1 declaring that it is unlawful knowingly to make a false statement 'in connection with the acquisition . . . of any firearm . . . from a . . . licensed dealer,' covers the redemption of a firearm from a pawnshop.\\n\\n\\n2\\n* On October 6, 1971, petitioner, William C. Huddleston, Jr., pawned his wife's Winchester 30-30-caliber rifle for $25 at a pawnshop in Oxnard, California. On the following October 15 and on December 28, he pawned at the same shop two other firearms, a Russian 7.62-caliber rifle and a Remington .22-caliber rifle, belonging to his wife. For these he received loans of $10 and $15, respectively. The owner of the pawnshop was a federally licensed firearms dealer.\\n\\n\\n3\\nSome weeks later, on February 1, 1972, and on March 10, Huddleston redeemed the weapons. In connection with each of the redemptions, the pawnbroker required petitioner to complete Treasury Form 4473, entitled 'Firearms Transaction Record.' This is a form used in the enforcement of the gun control provision of Title IV of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Pub.L. 90-351, 82 Stat. 225, as amended by the Gun Control Act of 1968, Pub.L. 90-618, 82 Stat. 1213, of which the above-cited 18 U.S.C. § 922(a)(6) is a part. Question 8b of the form is:\\n\\n\\n4\\n'Have you been convicted in any court of a crime punishable      by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year? (Note: The      actual sentence given by the judge does not matter—a yes      answer is necessary if the judge could have given a sentence      of more than one year.)'\\n\\n\\n5\\nThe question is derived from the statutory prohibition against a dealer's selling or otherwise disposing of a firearm to any person who 'has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.' 18 U.S.C. § 922(d)(1).2 Petitioner answered 'no' to Question 8b on each of the three Forms 4473. He then affixed his signature to each form's certification that the answers were true and correct, that he understood that a person who answers any of the questions in the affirmative is prohibited by federal law from 'purchasing and/or possessing a firearm,' and that he also understood that the making of any false statement with respect to the transaction is a crime punishable as a felony.\\n\\n\\n6\\nIn fact, Huddleston, six years earlier, had been convicted in a California state court for writing checks without sufficient funds, an offense punishable under California law by a maximum term of 14 years.3 This fact, if revealed to the pawnshop proprietor, would have precluded the proprietor from selling or otherwise disposing of any of the rifles to the petitioner because of the proscription in 18 U.S.C. § 922(d)(1).\\n\\n\\n7\\nHuddleston was charged in a three-count indictment with violating 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(a)(6) and 924(a).4 He moved to dismiss the indictment, in part on the ground that § 922(a)(6) was never intended to apply, and should not apply, to a pawnor's redemption of a weapon he had pawned. This motion was denied. Petitioner then pleaded not guilty and waived a jury trial.\\n\\n\\n8\\nThe Government's evidence consisted primarily of the three Treasury Forms 4473 Huddleston had signed; the record of his earlier California felony conviction; and the pawnbroker's federal license. A Government agent also testified that petitioner, after being arrested and advised of his rights, made statements admitting that he had known, when filling out the forms, that he was a felon and that he had lied each time when he answered Question 8b in the negative.\\n\\n\\n9\\nHuddleston testified in his own defense. He stated that he did not knowingly make a false statement; that he did not read the form and simply answered 'no' upon prompting from the pawnbroker; and that he was unaware that his California conviction was punishable by a term exceeding one year.5\\n\\n\\n10\\nThe District Judge found the petitioner guilty on all counts. He sentenced Huddleston to three concurrent three-year terms. The sentences were suspended, however, except for 20 days to be served on weekends. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, by a divided vote, affirmed the conviction. 472 F.2d 592 (1973). The dissenting judge agreed that the statute was constitutional as applied, but concluded that what Huddleston did was to 'reacquire' the rifles, and that 'reacquire' is not necessarily included within the statute's term 'acquire.' Id., at 593. We granted certiorari, 411 U.S. 930, 93 S.Ct. 1898, 36 L.Ed.2d 389 (1973), to resolve an existing conflict among the circuits on the issue whether the prohibition against making false statements in connection with the acquisition of a firearm covers a firearm's redemption from a pawnshop.6\\n\\nII\\n\\n11\\nPetitioner's assault on the statute under which he was convicted is two pronged. First, it is argued that both the statute's language and its legislative history indicate that Congress did not intend a pawnshop redemption of a firearm to be an 'acquisition' covered by the statute. Second, it is said that even if Congress did intend a pawnshop redemption to be a covered 'acquisition,' the statute is so ambiguous that its construction is controlled by the maxim that ambiguity in a criminal statute is to be resolved in favor of the defendant.\\n\\n\\n12\\nWe turn first to the language and structure of the Act. Reduced to a minimum, § 922(a)(6) relates to any false statement made 'in connection with the acquisition . . . of any firearm' from a licensed dealer and intended or likely to deceive the dealer 'with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale or other disposition of such firearm.'\\n\\n\\n13\\nPetitioner attaches great significance to the word 'acquisition.' He urges that it suggests only a sale-like transaction. Since Congress in § 922(a)(6) did not use words of transfer or delivery, as it did in other sections of the Act, he argues that 'acquisition' must have a narrower meaning than those terms. Moreover, since a pawn transaction is only a temporary bailment of personal property, with the pawnshop having merely a security interest in the pledged property, title or ownership is constant in the pawnor, and the pawnplus-redemption transaction is no more than an interruption in the pawnor's possession. The pawnor simply repossesses his own property, and he does not 'acquire' any new title or interest in the object pawned. At most, he 'reacquires' the object, and reacquisition, as the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals noted, is not necessarily included in the statutory term 'acquisition.'\\n\\n\\n14\\nOn its face, this argument might be said to have some force. A careful look at the statutory language and at complementary provisions of the Act, however, convinces us that the asserted ambiguity is contrived. Petitioner is mistaken in focusing solely on the term 'acquisition' and in enshrouding it with an extra-statutory 'legal title' or 'ownership' analysis. The word 'acquire' is defined to mean simply 'to come into possession, control, or power of disposal of.' Webster's New International Dictionary (3d ed., 1966, unabridged); United States v. Laisure, 460 F.2d 709, 712 n. 3 (CA5 1972). There is no intimation here that title or ownership would be necessary for possession, or control, or disposal power, and there is nothing else in the statute that justifies the imposition of that gloss. Moreover, a full reading of § 922(a)(6) clearly demonstrates that the false statements that are prohibited are those made with respect to the lawfulness of the sale 'or other disposition' of a firearm by a licensed dealer. The word 'acquisition,' therefore, cannot be considered apart from the phrase 'sale or other disposition.' As the Government suggests, and indeed as the petitioner implicitly reasoned at oral argument, Tr. of Oral Arg. 11, if the pawnbroker 'sells' or 'disposes' under § 922(a)(6), the transferee necessarily 'acquires.' These words, as used in the statute, are correlatives. The focus of our inquiry, therefore, should be to determine whether a 'sale or other disposition' of a firearm by a pawnbroker encompasses the redemption of the firearm by a pawnor.\\n\\n\\n15\\nClearly, a redemption is not a 'sale' for the simple reason that a sale has definite connotations of ownership and title. Some 'other disposition' of a firearm, however, could easily encompass a pawnshop redemption. We believe that it does.\\n\\n\\n16\\nIt is the dealer who sells or disposes of the firearm. The statute defines the dealer to be:\\n\\n\\n17\\n'(A) any person engaged in the business of selling firearms      or ammunition at wholesale or retail, (B) any person engaged      in the business of repairing firearms or of making or fitting      special barrels, stocks, or trigger mechanisms to firearms,      or (C) any person who is a pawnbroker.' 18 U.S.C. §      921(a)(11) (emphasis supplied).\\n\\n\\n18\\nIt defines a 'pawnbroker' as 'any person whose business or occupation includes the taking or receiving, by way of pledge or pawn, of any firearm or ammunition as security for the payment or repayment of money.' 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(12) (emphasis supplied).\\n\\n\\n19\\nThese definitions surely suggest that a 'sale or other disposition' of a firearm in a pawnshop is covered by the statute. This, of course, does not of itself resolve the question as to exactly what 'other disposition' by a pawnbroker is included. It should be apparent, however, that if Congress had intended to include only a pawnbroker's default sales of pledged or pawned goods, or his wholesale and retail sales of nonpawned goods, and to exclude the redemption of pawned articles, then the explicit inclusion of the pawnbroker in the definition of 'dealer' would serve no purpose, since part (A) of the definition, covering wholesale and retail sales, would otherwise reach all such sales. United States v. Rosen, 352 F.Supp. 727, 729 (D.C. Idaho 1973). At oral argument counsel suggested that the specific reference to a pawnbroker might have been intended to include 'disposition' by barter, swap, trade, or gift. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5-7. This interpretation strains belief. Trades or gifts are not peculiar to pawnbrokers. Wholesalers and retailers may indulge in such dispositions. There is nothing in the legislative history to indicate that this interpretation prompted the specific mention of a pawnbroker in part (C) of the definition. To the contrary, the committee reports indicate that part (C) 'specifically provides that a pawnbroker dealing in firearms shall be considered a dealer.' H.R.Rep.No.1577, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., (1968) (emphasis supplied). See also S.Rep.No.1501, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 30 (1968), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1968, p. 4417.\\n\\n\\n20\\nWe also cannot ignore the explicit reference to a firearm transaction 'by way of pledge or pawn' in the statutory definition of 'pawnbroker' in § 921(a)(12). Had Congress' desire been to exempt a transaction of this kind, it would have artfully worded the definition so as to exclude it. We are equally impressed by Congress' failure to exempt redemptive transactions from the prohibitions of the Act when it so carefully carved out exceptions for a dealer 'returning a firearm' and for an individual mailing a firearm to a dealer 'for the sole purpose of repair or customizing.' § 922(a)(2)(A). Petitioner contends that a redemptive transaction is no different from the return of a gun left for repair. His argument is that the pawned weapon is simply 'returned' to the individual who left it and represents a mere restoration to its original status. We believe, however, that it was not unreasonable for Congress to choose to view the pawn transaction as something more than the mere interruption in possession typical of repair. The fact that Congress thought it necessary specifically to exempt the repair transaction indicates that it otherwise would have been covered and, if this were so, clearly a pawn transaction likewise would be covered.\\n\\n\\n21\\nOther provisions of the Act also make it clear that the statute generally covers all transfers of firearms by dealers to recipients. Section 922(a)(1) makes it unlawful for any person, except a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer, to engage in the business of 'dealing' in firearms, or in the course of such business 'to ship, transport, or receive any firearm.' Section 922(b)(1) makes it unlawful for a dealer 'to sell or deliver' firearms of specified types to persons under 18 or 21 years of age. Section 922(b)(2) makes it unlawful for a dealer to 'sell or deliver' a weapon to a person in any State where 'at the place of sale, delivery or other disposition,' the transfer would violate local law. Section 922(d) makes it unlawful for a dealer 'to sell or otherwise dispose of' a firearm to a person under a felony indictment, a felon, a fugitive, a narcotic addict, or a mental defective. Section 923(g) requires that each licensed dealer maintain 'records of importation, production, shipment, receipt, sale, or other disposition, of firearms.'\\n\\n\\n22\\nIn sum, the word 'acquisition,' as used in § 922(a)(6), is not ambiguous, but clearly includes any person, by definition, who 'come[s] into possession, control, or power of disposal' of a firearm. As noted above, 'acquisition' and 'sale or other disposition' are correlatives. It is reasonable to conclude that a pawnbroker might 'dispose' of a firearm through a redemptive transaction. And because Congress explicitly included pawnbrokers in the Act, explicitly mentioned pledge and pawn transactions involving firearms, and clearly failed to include them among the statutory exceptions, we are not at liberty to tamper with the obvious reach of the statute in proscribing the conduct in which the petitioner engaged.\\n\\nIII\\n\\n23\\nThe legislative history, too, supports this reading of the statute. This is apparent from the aims and purposes of the Act and from the method Congress adopted to achieve those objectives. When Congress enacted the provisions under which petitioner was convicted, it was concerned with the widespread traffic in firearms and with their general availability to those whose possession thereof was contrary to the public interest. Pub.L. 90-351, § 1201, 82 Stat. 236, as amended by Pub.L. 90-618, § 301(a)(1), 82 Stat. 1236, 18 U.S.C.App. § 1201. Congress determined that the ease with which firearms could be obtained contributed significantly to the prevalence of lawlessness and violent crime in the United States. S.Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 108 (1968) U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1968, p. 2112. The principal purpose of the federal gun control legislation, therefore, was to crub crime by keeping 'firearms out of the hands of those not legally entitled to possess them because of age, criminal background, or incompetency.' S.Rep. No. 1501, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 22 (1968). U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1968, p. 4410.\\n\\n\\n24\\nTitle IV of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 and the Gun Control Act of 1968 are thus aimed at restricting public access to firearms. Commerce in firearms is channeled through federally licensed importers, manufacturers, and dealers in an attempt to halt mail-order and interstate consumer traffic in these weapons. The principal agent of federal enforcement is the dealer. He is licensed, §§ 922(a)(1) and 923(a); he is required to keep records of 'sale . . . or other disposition,' § 923(g); and he is subject to a criminal penalty for disposing of a weapon contrary to the provisions of the Act, § 924.\\n\\n\\n25\\nSection 922(a)(6), the provision under which petitioner was convicted, was enacted as a means of providing adequate and truthful information about firearms transactions. Information drawn from records kept by dealers was a prime guarantee of the Act's effectiveness in keeping 'these lethal weapons out of the hands of criminals, drug addicts, mentally disordered persons, juveniles, and other persons whose possession of them is too high a price in danger to us all to allow.' 114 Cong.Rec. 13219 (1968) (remarks of Sen. Tydings). Thus, any false statement with respect to the eligibility of a person to obtain a firearm from a licensed dealer was made subject to a criminal penalty.\\n\\n\\n26\\nFrom this outline of the Act, it is apparent that the focus of the federal scheme is the federally licensed firearms dealer, at least insofar as the Act directly controls access to weapons by users. Firearms are channeled through dealers to eliminate the mail order and the generally widespread commerce in them, and to insure that, in the course of sales or other dispositions by these dealers, weapons could not be obtained by individuals whose possession of them would be contrary to the public interest. Thus, the conclusion we reached above with respect to the language and structure of the Act, that firearms redemptions in pawnshops are covered, is entirely consonant with the achievement of this congressional objective and method of enforcing the Act.\\n\\n\\n27\\nMoreover, as was said in United States v. Bramblett, 348 U.S. 503, 507, 75 S.Ct. 504, 507, 99 L.Ed. 594 (1955), 'There is no indication in either the committee reports or in the congressional debates that the scope of the statute was to be in any way restricted' (footnotes omitted). Indeed, the committee reports indicate that the proscription under § 922(d) on the sale or other disposition of a firearm to a felon 'goes to all types of sales or dispositions— over-the-counter as well as mail order.'7 S.Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 115 (1968). See S.Rep. No. 1501, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 34 (1968), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1968, p. 4410. As far as the parties have informed us, and as far as our independent research has revealed, there is no discussion of the actual meaning of 'acquisition' or of 'sale or other disposition' in the legislative history. Previous legislation relating to the particular term 'other disposition' sheds some light, however, and prudence calls on us to look to it in ascertaining the legislative purpose. United States v. Katz, 271 U.S. 354, 357, 46 S.Ct. 513, 514, 70 L.Ed. 986 (1926). The term apparently had its origin in § 1(k) of the National Firearms Act, Pub.L. 474, 48 Stat. 1236 (1934). That Act set certain conditions on the 'transfer' of machine guns and other dangerous weapons. As defined by the Act, 'transfer' meant 'to sell, assign, pledge, lease, loan, give away, or otherwise dispose of.' The term 'otherwise dispose of' in that context was aimed at providing maximum coverage. The interpretation we adopt here accomplishes the same objective.8\\n\\n\\n28\\nThere also can be no doubt of Congress' intention to deprive the juvenile, the mentally incompetent, the criminal, and the fugitive of the use of firearms. Senator Tydings stated:\\n\\n\\n29\\n'Title IV, the concealed weapons amendment, is a very      limited, stripped-down, bare-minimum guntraffic control bill,      primarily designed to reduce access to handguns for      criminals, juveniles, and fugitives . . .. I can fairly say      that this concealed weapons amendment does not significantly      inconvenience hunters and sportsmen in any way. The people it      does frustrate are the juveniles, felons, and fugitives who      today can, with total anonymity and impunity, obtain guns by      mail or by crossing into neighboring States with lax or no      gun laws at all, regardless of the law of their own State.'      114 Cong.Rec. 13647 (1968).\\n\\n\\n30\\nCongressman Celler, the House Manager, stated:\\n\\n\\n31\\n'Mr. Chairman, none of us who support Federal firearms      controls believe that any bill or any system of control can      guarantee that society will be safe from firearms misuse. But      we are convinced that a strengthened system can significantly      contribute to reducting the danger of crime in the United      States. No one can dispute the need to prevent drug addicts,      mental incompetents, persons with a history of mental      disturbances, and persons convicted of certain offenses, from      buying, owning, or possessing firearms. This bill seeks to      maximize the possibility of keeping firearms out of the hands      of such persons.' Id., at Rec. 21784.\\n\\n\\n32\\nCongressman McCulloch, a senior member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, in referring specifically to § 922(a)(6), stated, '[The bill] makes it unlawful . . . [f]or any person, in connection with obtaining a firearm or ammunition from a licensee, to make a false representation material to such acquisition.' Id., at 21789.9 Given these statements of congressional purpose, it would be unwarranted to except pawnshop redemptions when, by virtue of the statutory language itself, such redemptions would be covered. Otherwise, every evil Congress hoped to cure would continue unabated.10\\n\\nIV\\n\\n33\\nPetitioner urges that the intention to include pawn redemptions is so ambiguous and uncertain that the statute should be narrowly construed in his favor. Reliance is placed upon the maxim that an 'ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.' Rewis v. United States, 401 U.S. 808, 812, 91 S.Ct. 1056, 1059, 28 L.Ed.2d 493 (1971); United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 347, 92 S.Ct. 515, 522, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971). This rule of narrow construction is rooted in the concern of the law for individual rights, and in the belief that fair warning should be accorded as to what conduct is criminal and punishable by deprivation of liberty or property. United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95, 5 L.Ed. 37 (1820); United States v. Bass, supra, 404 U.S., at 348, 92 S.Ct., at 522-523. The rule is also the product of an awareness that legislators and not the courts should define criminal activity. Zeal in forwarding these laudable policies, however, must not be permitted to shadow the understanding that '[s]ound rules of statutory interpretation exist to discover and not to direct the Congressional will.' United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U.S. 537, 542, 63 S.Ct. 379, 383, 87 L.Ed. 443 (1943). Although penal laws are to be construed strictly, they 'ought not to be construed so strictly as to defeat the obvious intention of the legislature.' American Fur Co. v. United States, 2 Pet. 358, 367, 7 L.Ed. 450 (1829); United States v. Wiltberger, supra; United States v. Morris, 14 Pet. 464, 475, 10 L.Ed. 543 (1840); United States v. Lacher, 134 U.S. 624, 10 S.Ct. 625, 33 L.Ed. 1080 (1890); United States v. Bramblett, 348 U.S., at 510, 75 S.Ct. at 508; United States v. Bass, 404 U.S., at 351, 92 S.Ct., at 524.\\n\\n\\n34\\nWe perceive no grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the language and structure of the Act. The statute in question clearly proscribes petitioner's conduct and accorded him fair warning of the sanctions the law placed on that conduct. Huddleston was not short of notice that his actions were unlawful. The question he answered untruthfully was preceded by a warning in boldface type that 'an untruthful answer may subject you to criminal prosecution.' The question itself was forthright and direct, stating that it was concerned with conviction of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and that this meant the term which could have been imposed and not the sentence actually given. Finally, petitioner was required to certify by his signature that his answers were true and correct and that he understood that 'the making of any false oral or written statement . . . with respect to this transaction is a crime punishable as a felony.' This warning also was in boldface type. Clearly, petitioner had adequate notice and warning of the consequences of his action.\\n\\n\\n35\\nOur reading of the statute cannot be viewed as judicial usurpation of the legislative function. The statute's language reveals an unmistakable attempt to include pawnshop transactions, by pledge or pawn, among the transactions covered by the Act. And Congress unquestionably made it unlawful for dealers, including pawnbrokers, 'to sell or otherwise dispose of any firearm' to a convicted felon, a juvenile, a drug addict, or a mental defective. § 922(d). Under these circumstances we will not blindly incant the rule of lenity to 'destroy the spirit and force of the law which the legislature intended to [and did] enact.' American Tobacco Co. v. Werckmeister, 207 U.S. 284, 293, 28 S.Ct. 72, 75, 52 L.Ed.2d 208 (1907); United States v. Katz, 271 U.S., at 357, 46 S.Ct., at 514.11\\n\\nV\\n\\n36\\nThe petitioner suggests, lastly, that the application of § 922(a)(6) to a pawn redemption would raise constitutional questions of some moment, and that these would not arise if the statute were narrowly construed. We fail to see the presence of issues of that import. There was no taking of Huddleston's property without just compensation. The rifles, in fact, were not his but his wife's. Moreover, Congress has determined that a convicted felon may not lawfully obtain weapons of that kind. Nor were petitioner's false answers in any way coerced. United States v. Knox, 396 U.S. 77, 79, 90 S.Ct. 363, 364-365, 24 L.Ed.2d 275 (1969); Bryson v. United States, 396 U.S. 64, 72, 90 S.Ct. 355, 360, 24 L.Ed.2d 264 (1969). Finally, no interstate commerce nexus need be demonstrated. Congress intended, and properly so, that §§ 922(a)(6) and (d)(1), in contrast to 18 U.S.C.App. § 1202(a)(1), see United States v. Bass, supra, were to reach transactions that are wholly intrastate, as the Court of Appeals correctly reasoned, 'on the theory that such transactions affect interstate commerce.' 472 F.2d, at 593.

United States, 346 U.S. 273, 73 S.Ct. 1152, 97 L.Ed. 1607. That case involved an ambiguity in a criminal law, an ambiguity that normally would be resolved in favor of life. A split Court in a tense period of American history unhappily resolved the ambiguity against life—a break with history which the conscience of our people will sometime rectify.\\n\\n\\n42\\nThe present case is a minor species of the same genus. A person who took his gun to a pawnshop for a loan undoubtedly had 'acquired' the gun prior to that time. It is therefore odd to think of the 'acquisition' occurring when he redeemed his own gun from the pawnshop. I agree with the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, United States v. Laisure, 460 F.2d 709, that the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of the accused. That is what we have quite consistently done, except in Rosenberg, in the past. See United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 347-348, 92 S.Ct. 515, 522-523, 30 L.Ed.2d 488, and cases cited.*\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n '§ 922.

The California complaint against Huddleston was in six counts and contained an allegation that he had been convicted previously in the State of Iowa of an offense which, if committed in California, would have been a violation of § 476 of the California Penal Code. He was eventually sentenced on the check charge to 30 days in jail.\\n\\n\\n4\\n '§ 924.

App. 37, 39. Upon inquiry by the court, he testified that when he was arraigned he thought he 'could get more than one year' and was so informed.

Laisure, 460 F.2d 709 (CA5 1972).\\n\\n\\n7\\n James V. Bennett, then Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, in Senate testimony offered a 'case study' vividly illustrating nonsale situations that would qualify as a firearms 'disposition' or 'acquisition.' One of his illustrations was the following:\\n'On September 26, 1958, a 20-year-old youth shot and seriously wounded a teller during the course of a bank robbery in St. Paul; only a week previously he had bought the revolver, a .357 Smith & Wesson, in a Minneapolis sporting goods store, pawned it the same day, and on the day of the robbery redeemed it with money obtained from check forgeries.'\\nMr. Bennett concluded his testimony with the observation, 'No responsible and thoughtful citizen can, in my opinion, seriously object to measures which would discourage youngsters, the mentally ill, and criminals from coming into possession of handguns.' Hearings before the Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 14, pp. 3369, 3377 (1963).\\n\\n\\n8\\n Testimony by then Attorney General Ramsey Clark also supports the rejection of petitioner's suggestion that the language of the statute be given a restrictive meaning:\\n'Mr. Donohue. Do you not think, Mr. Attorney General, to attain the real objective and purpose of this bill, it should not only deal with the sale, but whoever sells or delivers?\\n'Mr. Clark. It covers delivery, too.'\\n'Mr. Donohue. Where?\\n'Mr. Clark. Well, generally through the bill when you talk about—well, it would be unlawful for any licensed importer to sell or deliver. Any licensed dealer to sell or deliver.\\n'Mr. Donohue. It is not restricted to just sale for consideration?\\n'Mr. Clark. No. The delivery, too.' Hearings on an Anti-Crime Program before Subcommittee No. 5 of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 260 (1967).\\n\\n\\n9\\n It should be apparent from these statements that Congress was not so much concerned with guaranteeing no interference with the ownership of weapons as it was in distinguishing between law-abiding citizens and those whose possession of weapons would be contrary to the public interest. Hunting, target practice, gun collecting, and the legitimate use of guns for individual protection are not proscribed by the Act. Ownership of a weapon, however, may be interfered with by seizure and forfeiture under the Act for any violation of its provisions. Section 924(d) incorporates the seizure and forfeiture provisions of the Internal Revenue Code when there is no violation of the provisions of the chapter or any rule or regulation thereunder. The Act itself thus contemplates interference with the ownership of weapons when those weapons fall into the hands of juveniles, criminals, drug addicts, and mental incompetents.\\n\\n\\n10\\n What few references there are to pawnbrokers in the debates indicate that Congress was definitely interested in curbing firearms traffic between pawnbrokers and convicted felons. Senator Tydings, a strong proponent of the bill which became the Act, expressed his concern when he compared the bill to a proposal that was offered as an alternative:\\n'[O]ne reading through the amendment for the first time would assume that pawnbrokers are covered by the critically important provisions of the affidavit-waiting period procedure. But, if a pawnbroker only receives secondhand weapons as security for the repayment of a loan and does not deal in new firearms, he is not transporting, shipping, or receiving a firearm in interstate or foreign commerce. Used weapons presumably will have come to rest in the hands of the borrower, and the transaction will be wholly intrastate. Such a pawnbroker would not need a Federal firearms license to conduct over-the-counter transactions in firearms. And, accordingly, he would not be a 'licensed dealer' required to comply with the affidavit-waiting period procedure for his over-the-counter sales in handguns. Now, if this analysis is correct, and I believe it is, this is no small omission. Surely the great bulk of criminally irresponsible purchasers of pistols and revolvers buy their weapons secondhand, and many of them from pawnshops. We all have seen the virtual arsenals displayed in the windows of pawnshop dealers in all of the major cities of the country. To say that we have effectively regulated traffic in firearms when we will not have touched the great bulk of these pawnbroker operations is a complete and utter hypocrisy.' 114 Cong.Rec. 13222 (1968).\\nSee also Memorandum placed in the record by Senator Dodd. Id., at 13320. Senator Tydings made this further comparison:\\n'[I]t is obvious that many persons with criminal records purchase from pawnbrokers, and there are many occasions when the pawnbroker known the criminal background of the client. Under Amendment No. 708, many of these pawnbrokers will not be required to be licensed. They would not need to comply with the affidavit procedure. And even if they were licensed, there would be no prohibition on their selling firearms to known criminals. Under\\ntitle IV, on the other hand, all of these pawnbrokers would be required to be licensed—because all dealers and manufacturers must be licensed whether or not they ship, receive, or transport in commerce—and all of them would be under direct Federal sanction not to sell firearms to known criminals. I ask you, which bill is likely to be more effective?'  Id., at 13223.\\nIt must be conceded that these remarks refer to 'selling' firearms, but we do not credit this fact as significant for purposes of determining whether a pawnshop redemption is covered by the Act. The plain language of the statute as enacted prohibits a dealer from 'selling or disposing of' firearms to felons, and petitioner's counsel at oral argument intimated that a pawnbroker, under this language, could dispose of a firearm other than by sale and be covered by the Act. Tr. of Oral Arg. 4-5. References in the legislative debate, moreover, are replete with shorthand language and this is merely an instance of its use. Had the legislators been engaged in a colloquy on the actual meaning of 'sale or other disposition of,' we might be more receptive to the interpretation proffered by the petitioner.\\nWe also note that the President of the Pawnbrokers' Association of the City of New York testified during congressional hearings that almost all firearm transactions by pawnshops are by pledge and redemption, and contended, therefore, that pawnbrokers should not be included as dealers under the Act. Hearings on a Federal Firearms Act before the Subcommittee to Investigate Juvenile Delinquency of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 1062-1065 (1967). Thus, informed of the fact that almost all firearms transactions by pawnbrokers were through pledge and redemption, and faced with the argument that pawnbrokers should not be considered as 'dealers,' Congress clearly chose to retain pawnbrokers as firearms dealers.\\nFinally, the language of the committee reports indicates that a 'sale or disposition' includes 'all types of sales or dispositions.' S.Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 115 (1968), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1968, p. 2112.\\n\\n\\n11\\n The decision today does not ignore the admonition of the Court in United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 349, 92 S.Ct. 515, 523, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971), that '[i]n traditionally sensitive areas, such as legislation affecting the federal balance, the requirement of clear statement assures that the legislature has in fact faced, and intended to bring into issue, the critical matters involved in the judicial decision.' This statute did affect the federal balance and it did so intentionally. As Senator Tydings explained:\\n'This concealed weapons amendment does not violate any State's right to make its own gun laws. Quite the contrary, title IV provides the controls on interstate gun traffic which only the Federal Government can apply, and without which no State gun law is worth the paper it is written on. . . . Without such Federal assistance, any State gun law can be subverted by any child, fugitive, or felon who orders a gun by mail or buys one in a neighboring State which has law gun laws.' 114 Cong.Rec. 13647 (1968).\\n\\n\\n*\\n Civil cases cited by the Court, e. g. American Tobacco Co. v. Werckmeister, 207 U.S. 284, 293, 28 S.Ct. 72, 74-75, 52 L.Ed. 208, are wide of the mark. For application of a law that sends people to prison for years where Congress has not made it clear they should be there, United States v. Bass, supra, 404 U.S. at 346, 92 S.Ct., at 521-522, is only another device as lacking in due process as Caligula's practice of printing the laws in small print and placing them so high on a wall that the ordinary man did not receive fair warning.\\n'When taxes of this kind had been proclaimed, but not published in writing, inasmuch as many offenses were committed through ignorance of the letter of the law, he at last, on the urgent demand of the people, had the law posted up, but in a very narrow place and in excessively small letters, to prevent the making of a copy.'

Sand, Washington, D.C., for the respondent.\\nMr. Justice BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n\\n\\n1\\nThe petitioner was convicted in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi of assaulting two federal officers with a deadly weapon in violation of former 18 U.S.C. § 254.1 The court sentenced the petitioner to the maximum punishment of 10 years' imprisonment on each conviction of assault, the sentences to run consecutively.2 Upon completion of the first 10-year sentence, the petitioner made a motion in the District Court, under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, 28 U.S.C.A. § 2255, to correct the second, and consecutive, sentence. He supported his motion by allegations that the evidence at his trial showed that he fired a single discharge from a shotgun into the front seat of an automobile and that the pellets wounded the two federal officers, who were transporting an arrested prisoner. He contended that in this circumstance he was guilty of but one 'assault' within the meaning of former § 254 and accordingly was subject to only one punishment. The District Court denied his motion and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 230 F.2d 726. Both courts held that the wounding of two federal officers by the single discharge of a shotgun would constitute a separate offense against each officer under the statute. We granted certiorari, 352 U.S. 907, 77 S.Ct. 151, 1 L.Ed.2d 116, to consider the construction of § 254 in light of principles applied to construe the federal criminal statutes involved in Bell v. United States, 349 U.S. 81, 75 S.Ct. 620, 99 L.Ed. 905; United States v. Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp., 344 U.S. 218, 73 S.Ct. 227, 97 L.Ed. 260, and Prince v. United States, 352 U.S. 322, 77 S.Ct. 403, 1 L.Ed.2d 370. We affirmed the Court of Appeals by an equally divided Court, 355 U.S. 282, 78 S.Ct. 336, 2 L.Ed.2d 270, but vacated our judgment, and set the case for reargument, when a petition for rehearing was granted. 356 U.S. 969, 78 S.Ct. 1004, 2 L.Ed.2d 1075. Reargument was had this Term.\\n\\n\\n2\\nIt is suggested that the remedy under § 2255 is not available to the petitioner in the circumstances of this case. The record does not disclose that the Government raised this question in the District Court or in the Court of Appeals, and the Government does not tender it as a Question Presented for Decision in its brief in this Court. This court has often reached the merits of a case involving questions of statutory construction similar to that presented in this case under former 18 U.S.C. § 254 in proceedings by way of collateral attack upon consecutive sentences. In In re Snow, 120 U.S. 274, 7 S.Ct. 556, 30 L.Ed. 658, the petitioner brought a habeas corpus proceeding after serving seven months of three consecutive six-month sentences. He claimed that the sentencing court had misinterpreted the applicable statute and that he had committed but a single offense punishable by a single six-month sentence. This Court held that 'the objection may be taken on habeas corpus when the sentence on more than one of the convictions is sought to be enforced.' Id., 120 U.S. at page 285, 7 S.Ct. at page 561. In Bell v. United States, supra, a case on all fours with the present case, the Court reached the question of statutory construction over objection in the Government's brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari that the question could not be raised on motion under § 2255. Other cases in which the Court reached and decided questions of statutory construction, although the questions were raised by collateral attack on consecutive sentences, include: Tinder v. United States, 345 U.S. 565, 73 S.Ct. 911, 97 L.Ed. 1250 (§ 2255); Gore v. United States, 357 U.S. 386, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405 (§ 2255); Prince v. United States, supra (Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35, 18 U.S.C.A.); Ebeling v. Morgan, 237 U.S. 625, 35 S.Ct. 710, 59 L.Ed. 1151 (habeas corpus); Morgan v. Devine, 237 U.S. 632, 35 S.Ct. 712, 59 L.Ed. 1153 (habeas corpus). The fact that the Court has so often reached the merits of the statutory construction issues in such proceedings suggests that the availability of a collateral remedy is not a jurisdictional question in the sense that, if not properly raised, this Court should nevertheless determine it sua sponte. Moreover, there was only meagre argument of the question of the availability of the remedy in this case. The Government submitted only a short discussion of the question in the body of its brief and made only a passing reference to it toward the close of the oral argument. The question of the scope of collateral attack upon criminal sentences is an important and complex one, judging from the number of decisions discussing it in the District Courts and the Courts of Appeals. We think that we should have the benefit of a full argument before dealing with the question. We, therefore, proceed to construe former 18 U.S.C. § 254 without, however, intimating any view as to the availability of a collateral remedy in another case where that question is properly raised, and is adequately briefed and argued in this Court.\\n\\n\\n3\\nThere is no constitutional issue presented. The question for decision is as to the construction to be given former § 254 in the circumstances alleged by the petitioner. Did Congress mean that the single discharge of a shotgun would constitute one assault, and thus only one offense, regardless of the number of officers affected, or did Congress define a separate offense for each federal officer affected by the doing of the act? The congressional meaning is plainly open to question on the face of the statute, which originated as § 2 of the Act of May 18, 1934. 48 Stat. 780. The Government does not seriously contend otherwise, but emphasizes that the legislative history shows that the statute was designed to protect federal officers from personal harm, or the threat of personal harm, in the performance of their duties, or on account of the performance of their duties. From this premise, the Government argues that there must be an offense for each officer who is put in immediate apprehension of personal injury, i.e., assaulted, and that each officer thus defines the unit of prosecution. The position is summed up in the Government's brief as follows: 'The legislation was aimed at protecting federal officers, not only to promote the orderly functioning of the federal government (whose efficiency would diminish in proportion to the number of individual officers affected), but also to protect the individual officers, as 'wards' of the federal government, from personal harm. Both of these legislative objectives make the individual officers a separate unit of protection.'\\n\\n\\n4\\nHowever, we are unable to read the legislative history as clearly illumining the statute with this meaning. The history is scant, consisting largely of an Attorney General's letter recommending the passage of the legislation,3 and sheds no real light on what Congress intended to be the unit of prosecution. Although the letter mentions the need for legislation for the protection of federal officers, it also speaks of the need for legislation 'to further the legitimate purposes of the Federal government.' From what appears, an argument at least as plausible as the Government's may be made that the congressional aim was to prevent hindrance to the execution of official duty, and thus to assure the carrying out of federal purposes and interests, and was not to protect federal officers except as incident to that aim. Support for this meaning may be found in the fact that § 254 makes it unlawful not only to assault federal officers engaged on official duty but also forcibly to resist, oppose, impede, intimidate or interfere with such officers. Clearly one may resist, oppose, or impede the officers or interfere with the performance of their duties without placing them in personal danger. Such a congressional aim would, of course, be served by considering the act of hindrance as the unit of prosecution without regard to the number of federal officers affected by the act. For example, the locking of the door of a building to prevent the entry of officers intending to arrest a person within would be an act of hindrance denounced by the statute. We cannot find clearly from the statute, even when read in the light of its legislative history, that the Congress intended that the person locking the door might commit as many crimes as there are officers denied entry. And if we cannot find this meaning in the supposed case, we cannot find that Congress intended that a single act of assault affecting two officers constitutes two offenses under the statute. The Government frankly conceded on the oral argument that assault can be treated no differently from the other outlawed activities,4 and that if a single act of hindrance which has an impact on two officers is only one offense when the act is not an assault, an act of assault can be only one offense even though it has an impact on two officers.\\n\\n\\n5\\nMoreover, an interpretation that there are as many assaults committed as there are officers affected would produce incongruous results. Punishments totally disproportionate to the act of assault could be imposed because it will often be the case that the number of officers affected will have little bearing upon the seriousness of the criminal act. For an assault is ordinarily held to be committed merely by putting another in apprehension of harm whether or not the actor actually intends to inflict or is capable of inflicting that harm.5 Thus under the meaning for which the Government contends, one who shoots and seriously wounds an officer would commit one offense punishable by 10 years' imprisonment, but if he points a gun at five officers, putting all of them in apprehension of harm, he would commit five offenses punishable by 50 years' imprisonment, even though he does not fire the gun and no officer actually suffers injury. It is difficult, without a clear indication than the materials before us provide, to find that Congress intended this result.\\n\\n\\n6\\nIt is therefore apparent that § 254 may as reasonably be read to mean that the single discharge of the shotgun would constitute an 'assault' without regard to the number of federal officers affected, as it may be read to mean that as many 'assaults' would be committed as there were officers affected. Neither the wording of the statute nor its legislative history points clearly to either meaning. In that circumstance the Court applies a policy of lenity and adopts the less harsh meaning. '(W)hen choice has to be made between two readings of what conduct Congress has made a crime, it is appropriate, before we choose the harsher alternative, to require that Congress should have spoken in language that is clear and definite. We should not derive criminal outlawry from some ambiguous implication.' United States v. Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp., 344 U.S. 218, 221—222, 73 S.Ct. 227, 229, 97 L.Ed. 260. And in Bell v. United States, 349 U.S. 81, 83, 75 S.Ct. 620, 622, 99 L.Ed. 905, the Court expressed this policy as follows: 'When Congress leaves to the Judiciary the task of imputing to Congress an undeclared will, the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of lenity.' See also Prince v. United States, supra; Gore v. United States, 357 U.S. 386, 391, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 1283, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405. This policy of lenity means that the Court will not interpret a federal criminal statute so as to increase the penalty that it places on an individual when such an interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what Congress intended. If Congress desires to create multiple offenses from a single act affecting more than one federal officer, Congress can make that meaning clear. We thus hold that the single discharge of a shotgun alleged by the petitioner in this case would constitute only a single violation of § 254.\\n\\n\\n7\\nIt follows that the petitioner is entitled to an opportunity to sustain his allegation that his conviction of two assaults rested upon evidence that the wounding of the two officers resulted from a single discharge of the gun.6 The District Court did not hold a hearing on his motion because of its view that the single discharge admitted by him resulted in two assaults. But the Court of Appeals, in affirming on the same ground, correctly acknowledged that if this were an erroneous view of the law, 'there is a necessity for the determination of such a factual question (and) there must be a hearing (at which) the (petitioner) is entitled to be present.' 230 F.2d at page 726, 728. See United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 205, 219—220, 72 S.Ct. 263, 272, 96 L.Ed. 232; Walker v. Johnston, 312 U.S. 275, 61 S.Ct. 574, 85 L.Ed. 830. Because the proceedings at the petitioner's trial were not transcribed7 it will be necessary at the hearing on the motion to reconstruct the trial record. We decide only the issue tendered by the parties and intimate no view as to whether the petitioner may be entitled to correction of the consecutive sentence under any different fact situation which the reconstructed trial record may disclose.\\n\\n\\n8\\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n\\n\\n9\\nIt is so ordered.\\n\\n\\n10\\nJudgment of Court of Appeals reversed and case remanded with directions.\\n\\n\\n11\\nMr. Justice CLARK (dissenting).\\n\\n\\n12\\nBy what to me is a dubious route, permitting a collateral attack to be made on this old judgment under § 22551 proceedings, the Court reaches the merits only to agree fully with Ladner's contentions. As I see it, this enlargement of jurisdiction under § 2255 will subject the trial court dockets to a rash of applications by prisoners and completely overturn the purpose of the Congress in adopting the § 2255 procedure in lieu of habeas corpus. Moreover, it appears that by adopting Ladner's view on the merits the Court clearly informs the criminal, if I might be permitted to borrow a phrase, that assaults on the lives of federal officers come just 'as cheap by the dozen.'\\n\\n\\n13\\nNearly fourteen years ago, two federal officers were ambushed and seriously wounded by Ladner when he shot them point-blank with a shotgun as they sat in the front seat of a vehicle transporting some prisoners arrested in a raid on an illicit distillery. He was convicted of an assault on each of the officers. Ladner contends that he fired only a single charge from the shotgun and is, therefore, guilty of only one offense, regardless of the number of officers assaulted.\\n\\n\\n14\\nThe principal issue, as I see the case, is the procedural one under § 2255, namely whether the Court should allow this collateral attack on Ladner's sentence. This important question, both argued and briefed by the Government, is, I think, wrongly decided by the Court. These proceedings are by motion under § 2255 to correct the consecutive sentences of ten years imposed on each of Counts 2 and 3 of the indictment. Count 2 charges an assault on Officer James Buford Reed, while Count 3 charges one on Officer W. W. Frost. The record is unclear, as the Court points out, as to how many discharges of the shotgun Ladner fired into the vehicle. Hence a determination of that issue must be made by the trial court on remand of the case.\\n\\n\\n15\\nClearly this is an error that should have been raised by appeal. It did not undermine the jurisdiction of the original trial court, for under the allegations of the indictment these counts clearly state separate offenses. It raises no constitutional issue. The history of § 2255 clearly reveals that such an attack was not authorized. Reference to United States v. Hayman, 1952, 342 U.S. 205, 72 S.Ct. 263, 96 L.Ed. 232, gives us a complete picture. The Judicial Conference of the United States proposed § 2255 to remedy the 'practical problems that had arisen in the administration of the federal courts' habeas corpus jurisdiction.' The Conference in submitting the measure to the Congress noted that\\n\\n\\n16\\n'The motion remedy broadly covers all situations where the      sentence is 'open to collateral attack.' As a remedy, it is      intended to be as broad as habeas corpus.' Hayman, supra, 342      U.S. at page 217, 72 S.Ct. at page 271.\\n\\n\\n17\\nIt is clear that in enacting § 2255, Congress did not intend to enlarge the available grounds for collateral attack, but rather sought only to correct serious administrative problems that had developed in the exercise over the years of habeas corpus jurisdiction.\\n\\n\\n18\\nThe Court today holds that the trial court may have committed an error of law which will require the reconstruction of the evidence as to the number of shots fired by Ladner. As I have indicated, this may require a retrial of this fourteen-year-old case. Here the indictment and judgment are admittedly regular on their faces. The dispute is entirely with the facts of the incident. The issue, therefore, is squarely governed by the principles of Sunal v. Large, 1947, 332 U.S. 174, 67 S.Ct. 1588, 91 L.Ed. 1982. That was a habeas corpus proceeding attacking a conviction admittedly obtained as a result of error of the trial court. As here, neither the jurisdiction of the trial court nor claimed constitutional violations were at issue. The Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Douglas, said:\\n\\n\\n19\\n'Congress * * * has provided a regular, orderly method for      correction of all such errors by granting an appeal to the      Circuit Courts of Appeals and by vesting us with certiorari      jurisdiction. * * * Every error is potentially reversible      error; and many rulings of the trial court spell the      difference between conviction and acquittal. If defendants      who accept the judgment of conviction and do not appeal can      later renew their attack on the judgment by habeas corpus, litigation in these criminal cases will be interminable. Wise      judicial administration of the federal courts counsels      against such course, at least where the error does not trench      on any constitutional rights of defendants nor involve the      jurisdiction of the trial court.' 332 U.S. at pages 181—182,      67 S.Ct. at page 1592.\\n\\n\\n20\\nThe history and language of § 2255 show that the same limitations are present in such proceedings and that they are equally jurisdictional. What was enacted by Congress to solve the practical problems created by the 'great increases' in habeas corpus applications today becomes the tool by which prisoners can pry open their convictions on even broader grounds than were ever permitted theretofore. It appears entirely probable that a much greater administrative problem will result than confronted the courts before the enactment of § 2255.\\n\\n\\n21\\nThe Court cites seven cases in which we decided 'questions of statutory construction' although the questions were raised by 'collateral attack upon consecutive sentences. * * *' But those cases only point up my position the more, i.e., that a collateral attack can be made only where the error in the sentence is apparent from the facts alleged in the four corners of the indictment or admitted by the parties. In five of the cases, i.e., In re Snow, 1887, 120 U.S. 274, 7 S.Ct. 556, 30 L.Ed. 658; Tinder v. United States, 1953, 345 U.S. 565, 73 S.Ct. 911, 97 L.Ed. 1250; Gore v. United States, 1958, 357 U.S. 386, 78 S.Ct. 1280, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405; Prince v. United States, 1957, 352 U.S. 322, 77 S.Ct. 403, 1 L.Ed.2d 370, and Ebeling v. Morgan, 1915, 237 U.S. 625, 35 S.Ct. 710, 59 L.Ed. 1151, the error in sentencing is apparent from the face of the indictment. In the remaining two cases, Bell v. United States, 1955, 349 U.S. 81, 75 S.Ct. 620, 99 L.Ed. 905;2 and Morgan v. Devine, 1915, 237 U.S. 632, 35 S.Ct. 712, 59 L.Ed. 1153, the facts were admitted. The importance of this distinction is indicated by the Court in Prince where it goes out of its way to point out that it was admitted by respondent that the robbery charged in Count 1 was performed immediately after the entry into the bank, charged in Count 2. The majority cannot point to a single case in this Court where collateral attack on consecutive sentences has been permitted under § 2255 when the facts were in dispute. There is none. The law has long been settled, formerly under habeas corpus and now under § 2255, to the contrary.\\n\\n\\n22\\nHowever, even more surprising to me, as it runs counter to my understanding of efficient judicial administration, is the Court's statement that its holding today should not be considered as 'intimating any view as to the availability of a collateral remedy in another case where that question is properly raised, and is adequately briefed and argued in this Court.' I find no counterpart for such a handling in our precedents. Implicit therein is the suggestion that come another case where the point is 'properly raised (and) adequately briefed and argued in this Court'3 then the conclusion will be different. Meanwhile, the Court says, Ladner is no precedent on the question of 'the availability of a collateral remedy.' Despite this, the Court permits its use here. This ad hoc disposition is not in keeping with good business conduct so necessary in court administration.\\n\\n\\n23\\nI do not reach the merits. The Congress, however, may correct that error of the Court. But the ad hoc manner in which it has today disposed of the case we shall have with us always—a precedent for others to follow.\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n That statute provides:\\n'Whoever shall forcibly resist, oppose, impede, intimidate, or interfere with any person * * * (if he is a federal officer designated in § 253) while engaged in the performance of his official duties, or shall assault him on account of the performance of his official duties, shall be * * * imprisoned not more than three years * * *; and whoever, in the commission of any of the acts described in this section, shall use a deadly or dangerous weapon shall be * * * imprisoned not more than ten years * * *.' 18 U.S.C. (1940 ed.) § 254.\\n\\n\\n2\\n Ladner was convicted by a jury on three separate counts; one for conspiring to assault the officers, a second for assaulting one of the officers, and a third for assaulting the other officer. He was sentenced for two years on the conspiracy count, which sentence was to run concurrently with a 10-year sentence for assaulting one of the officers. A 10-year sentence imposed for the assault on the second officer was to run from and after the expiration of the first two sentences. Thus Ladner was sentenced to a total jail term of 20 years. The proceedings instituted by Ladner's co-conspirator, one Cameron, for post-conviction relief are reported in United States v. Cameron, D.C., 84 F.Supp. 289.\\n\\n\\n3\\n The letter, of January 3, 1934, to Senator Ashurst, Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, is as follows:\\n'My dear Senator:\\n'I wish again to renew the recommendation of this Department that legislation be enacted making it a Federal offense forcibly to resist, impede, or interfere with, or to assault or kill, any official or employee of the United States while engaged in, or on account of, the performance of his official duties. Congress has already made it a Federal offense to assault, resist, etc., officers or employees of the Bureau of Animal Industry of the Department of Agriculture while engaged in or on account of the execution of their duties (sec. 62, C.C., sec. 118, title 18, U.S.C.); to assault, resist, etc., officers and others of the Customs and Internal Revenue, while engaged in the execution of their duties (sec. 65, C.C., sec. 121, title 18, U.S.C.); to assault, resist, beat, wound, etc., any officer of the United States, or other person duly authorized while serving or attempting to serve the process of any court of the United States (sec. 140, C.C., sec. 245, title 18, U.S.C.); and to assault, resist, etc., immigration officials or employees while engaged in the performance of their duties (sec. 16, Immigration Act of Feb. 5, 1917, c. 29, 39 Stat. 885, sec. 152, title 8, U.S.C.). Three of the statutes just cited impose an increased penalty when a deadly or dangerous weapon is used in resisting the officer or employee.\\n'The need for general legislation of the same character, for the protection of Federal officers and employees other than those specifically embraced in the statutes above cited, becomes increasingly apparent every day. The Federal Government should not be com-\\npelled to rely upon the courts of the States, however respectable and well disposed, for the protection of its investigative and law-enforcement personnel; and Congress has recognized this fact at least to the extent indicated by the special acts above cited. This Department has found need for similar legislation for the adequate protection of the special agents of its division of investigation, several of whom have been assaulted in the course of a year, while in the performance of their official duties.\\n'In these cases resort must usually be had to the local police court, which affords but little relief to us, under the circumstances, in our effort to further the legitimate purposes of the Federal Government. It would seem to be preferable, however, instead of further extending the piecemeal legislation now on the statute books, to enact a broad general statute to embrace all proper cases, both within and outside the scope of existing legislation. Other cases in point are assaults on letter carriers, to cover which the Post Office Department has for several years past sought legislation; and the serious wounding, a couple of years ago, of the warden of the Federal Penitentiary at Leavenworth by escaped convicts outside the Federal jurisdiction. In the latter case it was possible to punish the escaped convicts under Federal law for their escape; but they could not be punished under any Federal law for the shooting of the warden.\\n'I have the honor, therefore, to enclose herewith a copy of S. 3184, which was introduced at the request of this Department in the Seventy-second Congress and to urge its reintroduction in the present Congress; and to express the hope that it may receive the prompt and serious consideration of your committee.\\n'Respectfully,\\n'Homer Cummings,\\n'Attorney General.'\\nSee, for the legislative history, S.Rep. No. 535, 73d Cong., 2d Sess.; H.R.Rep. No. 1455, 73d Cong., 2d Sess.; 78 Cong.Rec. 8126—8127.\\n\\n\\n4\\n This concession by the Government seems necessary in view of the lack of any indication that assault was to be treated differently, and in light of 18 U.S.C. § 111, 18 U.S.C.A. § 111, the present recodification of § 254, which lumps assault in with the rest of the offensive actions. The statute now provides that 'Whoever forcibly assaults, resists, opposes, impedes, intimidates, or interferes with' any designated federal officer 'while engaged in or on account of the performance of his official duties' is committing a crime. The Reviser's Note indicates that this change in wording was not intended to be a substantive one.\\n\\n\\n5\\n See Burdick, Law of Crime (1946), § 342; Clark and Marshall, Law of Crimes (1958), § 10.16; Miller on Criminal Law (1934) § 99.\\n\\n\\n6\\n In view of the trial judge's recollection that 'more than one shot was fired into the car in which the officers were riding * * *' we cannot say that it is impossible that petitioner was properly convicted of more than one offense, even under the principles which govern here.\\n\\n\\n7\\n Although 58 Stat. 5, now 28 U.S.C. § 753, 28 U.S.C.A. § 753, which provides for the recording of all proceedings in criminal cases, was enacted on January 20, 1944, Congress had not appropriated funds for the payment of court reporters at the time of the trial in June 1944. See Richard v. United States, 5 Cir., 148 F.2d 895; Vickers v. United States, 8 Cir., 157 F.2d 285.\\n\\n\\n1\\n 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (1952), 28 U.S.C.A. § 2255.\\n\\n\\n2\\n Though the § 2255 issue was mentioned in the Government's reply to the petition for certiorari in Bell, the question was not briefed nor argued on the merits.\\n\\n\\n3\\n The point was raised in this Court. The Government devoted four and one-half pages of its 29-page brief to it, discussing 18 separate cases. My research of the question indicates there would be little to add to the Government's discussion.\\n\\n\\n\"}]\n",

Based on his criminal history, the district court1 enhanced\\nLevering’s sentence pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C.\\n§ 924(e), and USSG § 4B1.4. The court later vacated Levering’s sentence under 28\\nU.S.C. § 2255 in light of intervening precedent, but again applied the ACCA\\nenhancement at a resentencing. Levering appeals the new sentence, and we affirm.\\n\\n       Following a three-day jury trial, Levering was found guilty of possession of a\\nfirearm as a previously convicted felon (Count I), see 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g), 924(e),\\nand possession of a stolen firearm (Count II), see 18 U.S.C. § 922(j). The ACCA\\nestablishes a mandatory minimum term of fifteen years’ imprisonment and a\\nmaximum of life imprisonment if a defendant is convicted under § 922(g) and has\\nsustained at least three previous convictions for a “violent felony . . . committed on\\noccasions different from one another.” 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). At sentencing, the\\ndistrict court determined that Levering had sustained at least three such convictions\\nso that he was subject to an enhanced statutory penalty under § 924(e) and an\\nincreased sentencing guideline range under USSG § 4B1.4(b)(3)(A). The court\\nimposed concurrent sentences of 262 months on Count I (at the bottom of the\\nadvisory guideline range) and 120 months on Count II.\\n\\n       The district court vacated Levering’s sentences in 2015 after the decision in\\nJohnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015), which declared unconstitutional the\\n“residual clause” of § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). 135 S. Ct. at 2563. In light of Johnson, the\\ncourt concluded that one of Levering’s prior convictions on which the court had\\nrelied at sentencing—a 2000 Nebraska conviction for escape from official\\ndetention—no longer qualified as a violent felony. At resentencing, however, the\\ncourt determined that without considering the escape conviction, Levering was still\\nan armed career criminal based on three other prior convictions: a 1989 Nebraska\\n\\n\\n      1\\n        The Honorable Laurie Smith Camp, Chief Judge, United States District Court\\nfor the District of Nebraska.\\n\\n                                         -2-\\n\\x0cconviction for first-degree assault and two 1994 Iowa convictions for assault while\\nparticipating in a felony. The court then varied downward from the advisory\\nguideline range and sentenced Levering to 240 months on Count I and 120 months\\non Count II, to be served concurrently.\\n\\n       The principal dispute on appeal concerns whether the two Iowa assault\\nconvictions were for violent felonies “committed on occasions different from one\\nanother” within the meaning of the ACCA. The convictions arose from Levering’s\\nhigh-speed flight from law enforcement officers in a stolen automobile on June 13,\\n1994. On that date, Levering drove a vehicle through Polk, Dallas, and Adair\\ncounties in Iowa, weaved in and out of traffic, ran his vehicle into a pursuing police\\ncar, and forced other vehicles off the road. Levering was charged and convicted of\\nassaults in all three counties. The district court concluded that the convictions from\\nDallas County and Adair County were for violent felonies that were committed on\\ndifferent occasions, and counted them both as predicate offenses for purposes of the\\nACCA.\\n\\n      Levering argues that the district court erred in making that determination. He\\ncontends that all of his assaults on June 13, 1994, occurred on a single “occasion”\\nwhile he fled from law enforcement officers in a high-speed chase across three Iowa\\ncounties. We must determine, therefore, whether Levering committed the two Iowa\\nassaults in Dallas County and Adair County on “occasions different from one\\nanother.”\\n\\n       As we explained in United States v. Davidson, 527 F.3d 703 (8th Cir. 2008),\\nvacated in part on other grounds by 551 F.3d 807 (8th Cir. 2008), and repeat here,\\nthe statutory provision at issue has its genesis in a decision of this court. Id. at 707-\\n08. In United States v. Petty, 798 F.2d 1157 (8th Cir. 1986), vacated, 481 U.S. 1034\\n(1987), this court held that a defendant was subject to an enhanced sentence under 18\\nU.S.C. § 1202(a)(1) (Supp. 1984), based on “three previous convictions . . . for\\n\\n                                          -3-\\n\\x0crobbery or burglary,” when he was “convicted in a single indictment of six counts of\\nrobbery stemming from an incident during which he robbed six different people in a\\nrestaurant simultaneously.” 798 F.2d at 1159-60. When Petty petitioned for a writ\\nof certiorari, the Solicitor General confessed error, noting that “the legislative history\\nstrongly supports the conclusion that the statute was intended to reach multiple\\ncriminal episodes that were distinct in time, not multiple felony convictions arising\\nout of a single criminal episode.” United States v. Petty, 828 F.2d 2, 3 (8th Cir.\\n1987). The Supreme Court remanded the case to this court for reconsideration in\\nlight of the Solicitor General’s position, Petty, 481 U.S. at 1034, and this court\\nremanded the case for resentencing. Petty, 828 F.2d at 3.\\n\\n      The following year, Congress amended the statute to add the requirement that\\na defendant must have sustained three convictions “on occasions different from one\\nanother” to qualify as an armed career criminal. Senator Biden, then the chair of the\\nSenate Judiciary Committee, explained his view that “a single multi-count conviction\\ncould still qualify where the counts related to crimes committed on different\\noccasions, but a robbery of multiple victims simultaneously (as in Petty) would count\\nas only one conviction.” 134 Cong. Rec. S17360-02 (Nov. 10, 1988).\\n\\n       Since then, courts presented with multiple convictions for felonies committed\\non a single day have striven to determine what is a separate “occasion.” We have said\\nthat offenses occur on different occasions if they are “separate and distinct criminal\\nepisodes that did not result from a continuous course of conduct.” United States v.\\nHamell, 3 F.3d 1187, 1191 (8th Cir. 1993); see also United States v. Deroo, 304 F.3d\\n824, 828 (8th Cir. 2002). But this rephrasing raises more questions: What is an\\n“episode,” and what is a “continuous course of conduct?”\\n\\n      We know that the Petty situation—six robberies in a restaurant at the same\\ntime—is one episode, a continuous course of conduct, and a single “occasion.” We\\nhave also concluded that two convictions for drug sales to two customers in the same\\n\\n                                           -4-\\n\\x0croom seconds apart counted as only one prior conviction under the ACCA, because\\nthe offenses were “committed, in essence, simultaneously.” United States v.\\nWilloughby, 653 F.3d 738, 742 (8th Cir. 2011). But even when an offender sets out\\nto commit multiple violent felonies on a single day, he can sustain more than one\\nqualifying conviction. In Deroo, we held that three burglaries on one night were\\ndistinct occasions where the defendant burglarized three cabins with different owners\\non different lakes. 304 F.3d at 828. We observed that the burglaries occurred in\\nthree separate places and involved three separate victims. Id. United States v. Gray,\\n85 F.3d 380 (8th Cir. 1996), similarly held that burglaries of two homes located very\\nclose to each other within twenty-five minutes were committed on separate occasions.\\nId. at 381.\\n\\n       In Hamell, we held that two assaults were committed on different occasions\\nwhere the defendant stabbed one victim with a knife inside a tavern, and shot at\\nanother victim twenty-five minutes later after that victim called the police and\\napproached the defendant’s girlfriend. 3 F.3d at 1191. We explained that the\\n“assaults happened at different times and places and had different motivations.” Id.\\nUnited States v. Humphrey, 759 F.3d 909 (8th Cir. 2014), likewise concluded that a\\ndefendant’s convictions for first-degree assault and first-degree robbery were separate\\npredicate offenses where the two offenses were committed fifteen minutes and three\\nblocks apart against different victims. Id. at 911-12. Synthesizing our decisions, the\\ncourt in Willoughby observed that important considerations in the inquiry include “the\\ntime lapse between offenses,” “the physical distance between their occurrence,” and\\n“their lack of overall substantive continuity, a factor that is often demonstrated in the\\nviolent-felony context by different victims or different aggressions.” 653 F.3d at 743.\\n\\n       In Levering’s case, the charging documents from the Iowa criminal cases\\nestablish that he committed the assaults in two different counties at different times\\nagainst different victims. One assault occurred in Dallas County, “just west of the\\nWest Des Moines city limits,” and the other in Adair County, “[a]s the vehicle\\n\\n                                          -5-\\n\\x0ctraveled west [on Interstate 80] in the eastbound lane.” In Dallas County, Levering\\ndrove his vehicle into a car driven by a pursuing police officer and ran him off the\\nroad; in Adair County, Levering forced numerous vehicles, including semi-trucks, off\\nthe road.2\\n\\n      Levering acknowledges all of this, but he maintains that the two assaults should\\ncount as only one predicate offense because they were part of a “continuous course\\nof conduct”—namely, his flight from police. Levering argues that his assaults, like\\nthe drug sales in Willoughby, were not “separate and distinct criminal episodes”\\nbecause they shared the same motivation—evading arrest—and were committed\\nwithout any intervening period of repose that might have provided Levering an\\nopportunity to cease his criminal activity.\\n\\n      We reject Levering’s argument as inconsistent with the thrust of our precedent.\\nAlthough the phrase “continuous course of conduct” appears in our cases on this\\n\\n\\n      2\\n        Several circuits have concluded that a sentencing court deciding the occasions-\\ndifferent question is limited to consulting judicial records of the type described in\\nShepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 26 (2005). See United States v. King, 853\\nF.3d 267, 270-75 (6th Cir. 2017); United States v. Dantzler, 771 F.3d 137, 143-46 (2d\\nCir. 2014); Kirkland v. United States, 687 F.3d 878, 883-87 (7th Cir. 2012); United\\nStates v. Sneed, 600 F.3d 1326, 1330-33 (11th Cir. 2010); United States v. Taylor,\\n413 F.3d 1146, 1156-58 (10th Cir. 2005); United States v. Thompson, 421 F.3d 278,\\n281-86 (4th Cir. 2005). This court in United States v. Boyles, 235 F.3d 1057 (8th Cir.\\n2000) (per curiam), said that Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575 (1990), did not\\nlimit the evidence that a sentencing court may consider, but Boyles relied on decisions\\nfrom the Sixth and Seventh Circuits that were later abrogated by Shepard. 235 F.3d\\nat 1057. We have not addressed the question directly in a published opinion since\\nShepard. See United States v. Melbie, 751 F.3d 586, 588 n.4 (8th Cir. 2014) (parties\\nwaived any objection); United States v. Keith, 638 F.3d 851, 853 (8th Cir. 2011)\\n(Shepard-approved materials sufficient to resolve dispute). Limiting our review to\\nthe Shepard materials would not affect the outcome here, so we take the conservative\\napproach by consulting only the charging documents and judgments.\\n\\n                                         -6-\\n\\x0csubject, it has proved unhelpful to the analysis. A burglar on a one-night crime spree\\nengages in a “continuous course of conduct,” in the ordinary sense of the phrase, as\\nhe moves from home to home stealing property within a short period. Yet we have\\nheld that multiple burglaries within an hour as part of a single plan are committed on\\ndifferent occasions because they involve different times, locations, and victims.\\nDeroo, 304 F.3d at 827-28; Gray, 85 F.3d at 381.\\n\\n       Levering is correct that a finding of “different motivations” for multiple\\noffenses can support a determination of different occasions, Hamell, 3 F.3d at 1191,\\nbut a change in purpose is not a necessary condition. A serial burglar presumably\\nacts with a single motivation to gather stolen property, but his multiple burglaries on\\na single night occur on different occasions. And while we have relied on “a\\ndiscernable pause in activity” between offenses to support a determination of\\ndifferent occasions, Davidson, 527 F.3d at 710, the primary significance of the pause\\nis the chance to discontinue criminal activity—an opportunity that is not present in\\nthe case of simultaneous offenses like the restaurant robbery in Petty or the dual drug\\nsale in Willoughby. Levering’s high-speed flight might not have facilitated calm\\nreflection, but the length of the pursuit undoubtedly gave him an opportunity “to\\ncease and desist from further criminal activity,” id., by discontinuing the chase or\\nmaking a conscious choice to avoid assaulting other drivers whom he encountered on\\nthe road. See United States v. Williams, 187 F.3d 429, 431 (4th Cir. 1999).\\n\\n       We respectfully differ with the broad statement in two unpublished opinions\\nfrom the Sixth Circuit that “[g]enerally when a person is evading or resisting arrest\\nimmediately following the actions giving rise to the arrest, subsequent offenses\\narising out of the evasion or resistance are part of the same criminal episode.” United\\nStates v. Clark, 591 F. App’x 367, 376 (6th Cir. 2014); see United States v. Mann,\\n552 F. App’x 464, 470 (6th Cir. 2014). These nonprecedential decisions purported\\nto derive the quoted proposition from United States v. Graves, 60 F.3d 1183 (6th Cir.\\n1995), see Mann, 552 F. App’x at 470, but they extended Graves in a significant way\\n\\n                                         -7-\\n\\x0cwithout convincing explanation. Graves involved a burglary and an assault that was\\ncommitted while resisting arrest for the burglary. The perpetrator “was still at the\\nlocation of the burglary when he was chased by the police and pointed the gun at the\\nofficer.” 60 F.3d at 1187. The common location for both offenses led the Graves\\ncourt to find the situation “more closely analogous to Petty where the defendant\\nsimultaneously robbed multiple victims.” Id. But Graves itself was rejected by the\\nFourth Circuit in United States v. Leeson, 453 F.3d 631, 643 n.5 (4th Cir. 2006), so\\nClark and Mann rise from a shaky foundation. And whatever the merit of Graves and\\nits conclusion about offenses committed in a single location, its rationale does not\\ndictate that all activity undertaken while resisting or evading arrest at different places\\nand at different times occurs on a single “occasion.”\\n\\n       Levering committed two assaults on the same date but at different times in\\ndifferent counties against different victims. We conclude that Levering’s assaults in\\nDallas and Adair counties were “committed on occasions different from one another”\\nand qualify as separate predicate offenses under § 924(e). The district court thus\\nproperly enhanced Levering’s sentence under the ACCA and the corresponding\\nsentencing guideline.\\n\\n       Levering also argues that the district court imposed a substantively\\nunreasonable sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). He contends that even if the court\\ncorrectly determined that Levering was an armed career criminal, the court abused its\\ndiscretion by giving too little weight to mitigating factors, such as Levering’s age and\\nsupportive family. The district court, however, has wide latitude in deciding how to\\nweigh the relevant factors under § 3553(a). In pronouncing Levering’s sentence, the\\ncourt stressed Levering’s lengthy criminal history and disciplinary violations while\\nin prison. The court observed that at the original sentencing, it “didn’t appear that\\n[Levering] had any intention to be a law-abiding, productive citizen.” Ultimately,\\nafter recognizing that Levering had accepted responsibility and was “no longer in\\ndenial,” the court varied downward from the advisory guideline range by 22 months\\n\\n                                           -8-\\n\\x0cand imposed concurrent sentences of 240 months on Count I and 120 months on\\nCount II. “[I]t is nearly inconceivable that the court abused its discretion in not\\nvarying downward still further.” United States v. Lazarski, 560 F.3d 731, 733 (8th\\nCir. 2009). We conclude that there was no abuse of discretion.\\n\\n      The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\\n                     ______________________________\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        -9-\\n\\x0c'}]\n",

Petitioner was indicted for violation of § 2024(b)(1).  At a jury trial in Federal District Court, the Government proved that petitioner on three occasions had purchased food stamps from an undercover Department of Agriculture agent for substantially less than their face value. The court refused petitioner\\'s proposed jury instruction that the Government must prove that petitioner knowingly did an act that the law forbids, purposely intending to violate the law.  Rather, over petitioner\\'s objection, the court instructed the jury that the Government had to prove that petitioner acquired and possessed the food stamps in a manner not authorized by statute or regulations and that he knowingly and willfully acquired the stamps.  Petitioner was convicted.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.\\nHeld:  Absent any indication of a contrary purpose in the statute\\'s language or legislative history, the Government in a prosecution for violation of § 2024(b)(1) must prove that the defendant knew that his acquisition or possession of food stamps was in a manner unauthorized by statute or regulations.  Pp. 423-434.\\n(a) Criminal offenses requiring no mens rea have a generally disfavored status.  The failure of Congress explicitly and unambiguously to indicate whether mens rea is required does not signal a departure from this background assumption of our criminal law.  Moreover, to interpret the statute to dispense with mens rea would be to criminalize a broad range of apparently innocent conduct.  In addition, requiring mens rea in this case is in keeping with the established principle that ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.  Pp. 425-428.\\n(b) The fact that § 2024(c), which is directed primarily at stores authorized to accept food stamps from program participants, differs in wording and structure from § 2024(b)(1) and provides that \"[w]hoever presents, or causes to be presented, coupons for payment or redemption . . . knowing the same to have been received, transferred, or used in any manner in violation of [the statute] or the regulations,\" fails to show a congressional purpose not to require proof of the defendant\\'s knowledge of illegality in a § 2024(b)(1) prosecution. Nor has it been shown that requiring knowledge of illegality in a § 2024(c), but not a § 2024(b)(1), prosecution is supported by such obvious and compelling policy reasons that it should be assumed that Congress intended to make such a distinction.  Pp. 428-430.\\n(c) United States v. Yermian, 468 U.S. 63, 104 S.Ct. 2936, 82 L.Ed.2d 53, does not support an interpretation of § 2024(b)(1) dispensing with the requirement that the Government prove the defendant\\'s knowledge of illegality.  Nor is the § 2024(b)(1) offense a \"public welfare\" offense that depends on no mental element but consists only of forbidden acts or omissions.

Rothfeld, Washington, D.C., for respondent, pro hac vice, by special leave of Court.\\nJustice BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n\\n\\n1\\nThe federal statute governing food stamp fraud provides that \"whoever knowingly uses, transfers, acquires, alters, or possesses coupons or authorization cards in any manner not authorized by [the statute] or the regulations\" is subject to a fine and imprisonment.  78 Stat. 708, as amended, 7 U.S.C. § 2024(b)(1).1 The question presented is whether in a prosecution under this provision the Government must prove that the defendant knew that he was acting in a manner not authorized by statute or regulations.\\n\\n\\n2\\n* Petitioner Frank Liparota was the co-owner with his brother of Moon\\'s Sandwich Shop in Chicago, Illinois.  He was indicted for acquiring and possessing food stamps in violation of § 2024(b)(1). The Department of Agriculture had not authorized petitioner\\'s restaurant to accept food stamps.  App. 6-7.2  At trial, the Government proved that petitioner on three occasions purchased food stamps from an undercover Department of Agriculture agent for substantially less than their face value.  On the first occasion, the agent informed petitioner that she had $195 worth of food stamps to sell.  The agent then accepted petitioner\\'s offer of $150 and consummated the transaction in a back room of the restaurant with petitioner\\'s brother.  A similar transaction occurred one week later, in which the agent sold $500 worth of coupons for $350.  Approximately one month later, petitioner bought $500 worth of food stamps from the agent for $300.\\n\\n\\n3\\nIn submitting the case to the jury, the District Court rejected petitioner\\'s proposed \"specific intent\" instruction, which would have instructed the jury that the Government must prove that \"the defendant knowingly did an act which the law forbids, purposely intending to violate the law.\"  Id., at 34.3 Concluding that \"[t]his is not a specific intent crime\" but rather a \"knowledge case,\" id., at 31, the District Court instead instructed the jury as follows:\\n\\n\\n4\\n\"When the word \\'knowingly\\' is used in these instructions, it      means that the Defendant realized what he was doing, and was      aware of the nature of his conduct, and did not act through      ignorance, mistake, or accident.  Knowledge may be proved by      defendant\\'s conduct and by all of the facts and circumstances      surrounding the case.\"  Id., at 33.\\n\\n\\n5\\nThe District Court also instructed that the Government had to prove that \"the Defendant acquired and possessed food stamp coupons for cash in a manner not authorized by federal statute or regulations\" and that \"the Defendant knowingly and wilfully acquired the food stamps.\"  3 Tr. 251.  Petitioner objected that this instruction required the jury to find merely that he knew that he was acquiring or possessing food stamps;  he argued that the statute should be construed instead to reach only \"people who knew that they were acting unlawfully.\"  App. 31.  The judge did not alter or supplement his instructions, and the jury returned a verdict of guilty.\\n\\n\\n6\\nPetitioner appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, arguing that the District Court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that \"specific intent\" is required in a prosecution under 7 U.S.C. § 2024(b)(1).  The Court of Appeals rejected petitioner\\'s arguments.  735 F.2d 1044 (1984). Because this decision conflicted with recent decisions of three other Courts of Appeals,4 we granted certiorari.  469 U.S. 930, 105 S.Ct. 322, 83 L.Ed.2d 260 (1984).  We reverse.\\n\\nII\\n\\n7\\nThe controversy between the parties concerns the mental state, if any, that the Government must show in proving that petitioner acted \"in any manner not authorized by [the statute] or the regulations.\"  The Government argues that petitioner violated the statute if he knew that he acquired or possessed food stamps and if in fact that acquisition or possession was in a manner not authorized by statute or regulations.  According to the Government, no mens rea, or \"evil-meaning mind,\" Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 251, 72 S.Ct. 240, 244, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952), is necessary for conviction.  Petitioner claims that the Government\\'s interpretation, by dispensing with mens rea, dispenses with the only morally blameworthy element in the definition of the crime.  To avoid this allegedly untoward result, he claims that an individual violates the statute if he knows that he has acquired or possessed food stamps and if he also knows that he has done so in an unauthorized manner.5  Our task is to determine which meaning Congress intended.\\n\\n\\n8\\nThe definition of the elements of a criminal offense is entrusted to the legislature, particularly in the case of federal crimes, which are solely creatures of statute.  United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 32, 3 L.Ed. 259 (1812).6  With respect to the element at issue in this case, however, Congress has not explicitly spelled out the mental state required.  Although Congress certainly intended by use of the word \"knowingly\" to require some mental state with respect to some element of the crime defined in § 2024(b)(1), the interpretations proffered by both parties accord with congressional intent to this extent. Beyond this, the words themselves provide little guidance.  Either interpretation would accord with ordinary usage.7  The legislative history of the statute contains nothing that would clarify the congressional purpose on this point.8\\n\\n\\n9\\nAbsent indication of contrary purpose in the language or legislative history of the statute, we believe that § 2024(b)(1) requires a showing that the defendant knew his conduct to be unauthorized by statute or regulations.9  \"The contention that an injury can amount to a crime only when inflicted by intention is no provincial or transient notion.  It is as universal and persistent in mature systems of law as belief in freedom of the human will and a consequent ability and duty of the normal individual to choose between good and evil.\" Morissette v. United States, supra, 342 U.S., at 250, 72 S.Ct., at 243.  Thus, in United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 438, 98 S.Ct. 2864, 2874, 57 L.Ed.2d 854 (1978), we noted that \"[c]ertainly far more than the simple omission of the appropriate phrase from the statutory definition is necessary to justify dispensing with an intent requirement\" and that criminal offenses requiring no mens rea have a \"generally disfavored status.\"  Similarly, in this case, the failure of Congress explicitly and unambiguously to indicate whether mens rea is required does not signal a departure from this background assumption of our criminal law.\\n\\n\\n10\\nThis construction is particularly appropriate where, as here, to interpret the statute otherwise would be to criminalize a broad range of apparently innocent conduct.  For instance, § 2024(b)(1) declares it criminal to use, transfer, acquire, alter, or possess food stamps in any manner not authorized by statute or regulations.  The statute provides further that \"[c]oupons issued to eligible households shall be used by them only to purchase food in retail food stores which have been approved for participation in the food stamp program at prices prevailing in such stores.\"  7 U.S.C. § 2016(b) (emphasis added);  see also 7 CFR § 274.10(a) (1985).10  This seems to be the only authorized use.  A strict reading of the statute with no knowledge-of-illegality requirement would thus render criminal a food stamp recipient who, for example, used stamps to purchase food from a store that, unknown to him, charged higher than normal prices to food stamp program participants.  Such a reading would also render criminal a nonrecipient of food stamps who \"possessed\" stamps because he was mistakenly sent them through the mail11 due to administrative error, \"altered\" them by tearing them up, and \"transferred\" them by throwing them away.  Of course, Congress could have intended that this broad range of conduct be made illegal, perhaps with the understanding that prosecutors would exercise their discretion to avoid such harsh results. However, given the paucity of material suggesting that Congress did so intend, we are reluctant to adopt such a sweeping interpretation.\\n\\n\\n11\\nIn addition, requiring mens rea is in keeping with our longstanding recognition of the principle that \"ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.\"  Rewis v. United States, 401 U.S. 808, 812, 91 S.Ct. 1056, 1059, 28 L.Ed.2d 493 (1971).  See also United States v. United States Gypsum Co., supra, 438 U.S., at 437, 98 S.Ct., at 2873;  United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 347-348, 92 S.Ct. 515, 522-523, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971);  Bell v. United States, 349 U.S. 81, 83, 75 S.Ct. 620, 622, 99 L.Ed. 905 (1955);  United States v. Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp., 344 U.S. 218, 221-222, 73 S.Ct. 227, 229-230, 97 L.Ed. 260 (1952).  Application of the rule of lenity ensures that criminal statutes will provide fair warning concerning conduct rendered illegal and strikes the appropriate balance between the legislature, the prosecutor, and the court in defining criminal liability.  See United States v. Bass, supra, 404 U.S., at 348, 92 S.Ct., at 523 (\"[B]ecause of the seriousness of criminal penalties, and because criminal punishment usually represents the moral condemnation of the community, legislatures and not courts should define criminal activity\").  Although the rule of lenity is not to be applied where to do so would conflict with the implied or expressed intent of Congress, it provides a time-honored interpretive guideline when the congressional purpose is unclear.  In the instant case, the rule directly supports petitioner\\'s contention that the Government must prove knowledge of illegality to convict him under § 2024(b)(1).\\n\\n\\n12\\nThe Government argues, however, that a comparison between § 2024(b)(1) and its companion, § 2024(c), demonstrates a congressional purpose not to require proof of the defendant\\'s knowledge of illegality in a § 2024(b)(1) prosecution.  Section 2024(c) is directed primarily at stores authorized to accept food stamps from program participants.  It provides that \"[w]hoever presents, or causes to be presented, coupons for payment or redemption . . . knowing the same to have been received, transferred, or used in any manner in violation of [the statute] or the regulations\" is subject to fine and imprisonment (emphasis added).12  The Government contrasts this language with that of § 2024(b)(1), in which the word \"knowingly\" is placed differently: \"whoever knowingly uses, transfers . . .\"  (emphasis added). Since § 2024(c) undeniably requires a knowledge of illegality, the suggested inference is that the difference in wording and structure between the two sections indicates that § 2024(b)(1) does not.\\n\\n\\n13\\nThe Government urges that this distinction between the mental state required for a § 2024(c) violation and that required for a § 2024(b)(1) violation is a sensible one.  Absent a requirement of mens rea, a grocer presenting food stamps for payment might be criminally liable under § 2024(c) even if his customer or employees have illegally procured or transferred the stamps without the grocer\\'s knowledge.  Requiring knowledge of illegality in a § 2024(c) prosecution is allegedly necessary to avoid this kind of vicarious, and non-fault-based, criminal liability.  Since the offense defined in § 2024(b)(1)—using, transferring, acquiring, altering, or possessing food stamps in an unauthorized manner—does not involve this possibility of vicarious liability, argues the Government, Congress had no reason to impose a similar knowledge of illegality requirement in that section.\\n\\n\\n14\\nWe do not find this argument persuasive.  The difference in wording between § 2024(b)(1) and § 2024(c) is too slender a reed to support the attempted distinction, for if the Government\\'s argument were accepted, it would lead to the demise of the very distinction that Congress is said to have desired.  According to the Government, Congress did intend a knowledge of illegality requirement in § 2024(c), while it did not intend such a requirement in § 2024(b)(1).  Anyone who has violated § 2024(c) has \"present[ed], or caus[ed] to be presented, coupons for payment or redemption\" in an unauthorized manner.  Such a person would seemingly have also \"use[d], transfer[red], acquir[ed], alter[ed], or possess[ed]\" the coupons in a similarly unauthorized manner, and thus to have violated § 2024(b)(1).  It follows that the Government will be able to prosecute any violator of § 2024(c) under § 2024(b)(1) as well.  If only § 2024(c)—and not § 2024(b)(1)—required the Government to prove knowledge of illegality, the result would be that the Government could always avoid proving knowledge of illegality in food stamp fraud cases, simply by bringing its prosecutions under § 2024(b)(1).  If Congress wanted to require the Government to prove knowledge of illegality in some, but not all, food stamp fraud cases, it thus chose a peculiar way to do so.\\n\\n\\n15\\nFor similar reasons, the Government\\'s arguments that Congress could have had a plausible reason to require knowledge of illegality in prosecutions under § 2024(c), but not § 2024(b)(1), are equally unpersuasive.  Grocers are participants in the food stamp program who have had the benefit of an extensive informational campaign concerning the authorized use and handling of food stamps.  App. 7-8.  Yet the Government would have to prove knowledge of illegality when prosecuting such grocers, while it would have no such burden when prosecuting third parties who may well have had no opportunity to acquaint themselves with the rules governing food stamps.  It is not immediately obvious that Congress would have been so concerned about imposing strict liability on grocers, while it had no similar concerns about imposing strict liability on nonparticipants in the program.  Our point once again is not that Congress could not have chosen to enact a statute along these lines, for there are no doubt policy arguments on both sides of the question as to whether such a statute would have been desirable.  Rather, we conclude that the policy underlying such a construction is neither so obvious nor so compelling that we must assume, in the absence of any discussion of this issue in the legislative history, that Congress did enact such a statute.13\\n\\n\\n16\\nThe Government advances two additional arguments in support of its reading of the statute.  First, the Government contends that this Court\\'s decision last Term in United States v. Yermian, 468 U.S. 63, 104 S.Ct. 2936, 82 L.Ed.2d 53 (1984), supports its interpretation.  Yermian involved a prosecution for violation of the federal false statement statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1001.14  All parties agreed that the statute required proof at least that the defendant \"knowingly and willfully\" made a false statement.  Thus, unlike the instant case, all parties in Yermian agreed that the Government had to prove the defendant\\'s mens rea.15  The controversy in Yermian centered on whether the Government also had to prove that the defendant knew that the false statement was made in a matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency.  With respect to this element, although the Court held that the Government did not have to prove actual knowledge of federal agency jurisdiction, the Court explicitly reserved the question whether some culpability was necessary with respect even to the jurisdictional element.  468 U.S., at 75, n. 14, 104 S.Ct., at 2943, n. 14. In contrast, the Government in the instant case argues that no mens rea is required with respect to any element of the crime.  Finally, Yermian found that the statutory language was unambiguous and that the legislative history supported its interpretation.  The statute at issue in this case differs in both respects.\\n\\n\\n17\\nSecond, the Government contends that the § 2024(b)(1) offense is a \"public welfare\" offense, which the Court defined in Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S., at 252-253, 72 S.Ct., at 244-245, to \"depend on no mental element but consist only of forbidden acts or omissions.\"  Yet the offense at issue here differs substantially from those \"public welfare offenses\" we have previously recognized.  In most previous instances, Congress has rendered criminal a type of conduct that a reasonable person should know is subject to stringent public regulation and may seriously threaten the community\\'s health or safety.  Thus, in United States v. Freed, 401 U.S. 601, 91 S.Ct. 1112, 28 L.Ed.2d 356 (1971), we examined the federal statute making it illegal to receive or possess an unregistered firearm.  In holding that the Government did not have to prove that the recipient of unregistered hand grenades knew that they were unregistered, we noted that \"one would hardly be surprised to learn that possession of hand grenades is not an innocent act.\"  Id., at 609, 91 S.Ct., at 1118. See also United States v. International Minerals & Chemical Corp., 402 U.S. 558, 564-565, 91 S.Ct. 1697, 1701-1702, 29 L.Ed.2d 178 (1971).  Similarly, in United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277, 284, 64 S.Ct. 134, 138, 88 L.Ed. 48 (1943), the Court held that a corporate officer could violate the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act when his firm shipped adulterated and misbranded drugs, even \"though consciousness of wrongdoing be totally wanting.\"  See also United States v. Balint, 258 U.S. 250, 42 S.Ct. 301, 66 L.Ed. 604 (1922).  The distinctions between these cases and the instant case are clear.  A food stamp can hardly be compared to a hand grenade, see Freed, nor can the unauthorized acquisition or possession of food stamps be compared to the selling of adulterated drugs, as in Dotterweich.\\n\\nIII\\n\\n18\\nWe hold that in a prosecution for violation of § 2024(b)(1), the Government must prove that the defendant knew that his acquisition or possession of food stamps was in a manner unauthorized by statute or regulations.16  This holding does not put an unduly heavy burden on the Government in prosecuting violators of § 2024(b)(1).  To prove that petitioner knew that his acquisition or possession of food stamps was unauthorized, for example, the Government need not show that he had knowledge of specific regulations governing food stamp acquisition or possession.  Nor must the Government introduce any extraordinary evidence that would conclusively demonstrate petitioner\\'s state of mind.  Rather, as in any other criminal prosecution requiring mens rea, the Government may prove by reference to facts and circumstances surrounding the case that petitioner knew that his conduct was unauthorized or illegal.17\\n\\n\\n19\\n\\nReversed.\\n\\n\\n\\n20\\nJustice POWELL took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\\n\\n\\n21\\nJustice WHITE, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting.\\n\\n\\n22\\nForsaking reliance on either the language or the history of § 2024(b)(1), the majority bases its result on the absence of an explicit rejection of the general principle that criminal liability requires not only an actus reus, but a mens rea.  In my view, the result below is in fact supported by the statute\\'s language and its history, and it is the majority that has ignored general principles of criminal liability.\\n\\n\\n23\\n* The Court views the statutory problem here as being how far down the sentence the term \"knowingly\" travels.  See ante, at 424-425, n. 7.  Accepting for the moment that if \"knowingly\" does extend to the \"in any manner\" language today\\'s holding would be correct—a position with which I take issue below I doubt that it gets that far.  The \"in any manner\" language is separated from the litany of verbs to which \"knowingly\" is directly connected by the intervening nouns.  We considered an identically phrased statute last Term in United States v. Yermian, 468 U.S. 63, 104 S.Ct. 2936, 82 L.Ed.2d 53 (1984).  The predecessor to the statute at issue in that case provided:  \" \\'[W]hoever shall knowingly and willfully . . . make . . . any false or fraudulent statements or representations . . . in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States . . . shall be fined.\\' \"  Id., at 69, n. 6, 104 S.Ct., at 2940, n. 6 (quoting Act of June 18, 1934, ch. 587, 48 Stat. 996).  We found that under the \"most natural reading\" of the statute, \"knowingly and willfully\" applied only to the making of false or fraudulent statements and not to the fact of jurisdiction.  468 U.S., at 69, n. 6, 104 S.Ct., at 2940, n. 6. By the same token, the \"most natural reading\" of § 2024(b)(1) is that \"knowingly\" modifies only the verbs to which it is attached.1\\n\\n\\n24\\nIn any event, I think that the premise of this approach is mistaken.  Even accepting that \"knowingly\" does extend through the sentence, or at least that we should read § 2024(b)(1) as if it does, the statute does not mean what the Court says it does.  Rather, it requires only that the defendant be aware of the relevant aspects of his conduct.  A requirement that the defendant know that he is acting in a particular manner, coupled with the fact that that manner is forbidden, does not establish a defense of ignorance of the law.  It creates only a defense of ignorance or mistake of fact.  Knowingly to do something that is unauthorized by law is not the same as doing something knowing that it is unauthorized by law.\\n\\n\\n25\\nThis point is demonstrated by the hypothetical statute referred to by the majority, which punishes one who \"knowingly sells a security without a permit.\"  See ante, at 424-425, n. 7. Even if \"knowingly\" does reach \"without a permit,\" I would think that a defendant who knew that he did not have a permit, though not that a permit was required, could be convicted.\\n\\n\\n26\\nSection 2024(b)(1) is an identical statute, except that instead of detailing the various legal requirements, it incorporates them by proscribing use of coupons \"in any manner not authorized\" by law.  This shorthand approach to drafting does not transform knowledge of illegality into an element of the crime. As written, § 2024(b)(1) is substantively no different than if it had been broken down into a collection of specific provisions making crimes of particular improper uses.  For example, food stamps cannot be used to purchase tobacco.  7 CFR §§ 271.2, 274.10(a), 278.2(a) (1985).  The statute might have said, inter alia, that anyone \"who knowingly uses coupons to purchase cigarettes\" commits a crime.  Under no plausible reading could a defendant then be acquitted because he did not know cigarettes are not \"eligible food.\"  But in fact, that is exactly what § 2024(b)(1) does say;  it just does not write it out longhand.\\n\\n\\n27\\nThe Court\\'s opinion provides another illustration of the general point:  someone who used food stamps to purchase groceries at inflated prices without realizing he was overcharged.2  I agree that such a person may not be convicted, but not for the reason given by the majority.  The purchaser did not \"knowingly\" use the stamps in the proscribed manner, for he was unaware of the circumstances of the transaction that made it illegal.\\n\\n\\n28\\nThe majority and I would part company in result as well as rationale if the purchaser knew he was charged higher than normal prices but not that overcharging is prohibited.  In such a case, he would have been aware of the nature of his actions, and therefore the purchase would have been \"knowing.\"  I would hold that such a mental state satisfies the statute.  Under the Court\\'s holding, as I understand it, that person could not be convicted because he did not know that his conduct was illegal.3\\n\\n\\n29\\nMuch has been made of the comparison between § 2024(b)(1) and § 2024(c).  The Government, like the court below, see 735 F.2d 1044, 1047-1048 (1984), argues that the express requirement of knowing illegality in subsection (c) supports an inference that the absence of such a provision in subsection (b)(1) was intentional.  While I disagree with the majority\\'s refutation of this argument,4 I view most of this discussion as beside the point.  The Government\\'s premise seems to me mistaken.  Subsection (c) does not impose a requirement of knowing illegality.  The provision is much like statutes that forbid the receipt or sale of stolen goods.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 641, 2313.  Just as those statutes generally require knowledge that the goods were stolen, so § 2024(c) requires knowledge of the past impropriety.  But receipt-of-stolen-goods statutes do not require that the defendant know that receipt itself is illegal, and similarly § 2024(c) plainly does not require that the defendant know that it is illegal to present coupons that have been improperly used in the past.  It is not inconceivable that someone presenting such coupons—again, like someone buying stolen goods—would think that his conduct was above-board despite the preceding illegality.  But that belief, however sincere, would not be a defense.  In short, because § 2024(c) does not require that the defendant know that the conduct for which he is being prosecuted was illegal, it does not create an ignorance-of-the-law defense.5\\n\\n\\n30\\nI therefore cannot draw the Government\\'s suggested inference. The two provisions are nonetheless fruitfully compared.  What matters is not their difference, but their similarity.  Neither contains any indication that \"knowledge of the law defining the offense [is] an element of the offense.\"  See ALI, Model Penal Code § 2.02, Comment 11, p. 131 (Tent.Draft No. 4, 1955).  A requirement of knowing illegality should not be read into either provision.\\n\\n\\n31\\nI do agree with the Government that when Congress wants to include a knowledge-of-illegality requirement in a statute it knows how to do so, even though I do not consider subsection (c) an example.  Other provisions of the United States Code explicitly include a requirement of familiarity with the law defining the offense—indeed, in places where, under the majority\\'s analysis, it is entirely superfluous.  E.g., 15 U.S.C. §§ 79z-3, 80a-48.  See also Model Penal Code, supra, at 139.  Congress could easily have included a similar provision in § 2024(b)(1), but did not.  Cf. United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 580-581, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2527-2528, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981).\\n\\n\\n32\\nFinally, the lower court\\'s reading of the statute is consistent with the legislative history.  As the majority points out, the history provides little to go on.  Significantly, however, the brief discussions of this provision in the relevant congressional Reports do not mention any requirement of knowing illegality.  To the contrary, when the Food Stamp Act was rewritten in 1977, the House Report noted that \"[a]ny unauthorized use, transfer, acquisition, alteration, or possession of food stamps . . . may be prosecuted under\" § 2024(b)(1).  H.R.Rep. No. 95-464, p. 376 (1977), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News p. 2305 (emphasis added).\\n\\nII\\n\\n33\\nThe broad principles of the Court\\'s opinion are easy to live with in a case such as this.  But the application of its reasoning might not always be so benign.  For example, § 2024(b)(1) is little different from the basic federal prohibition on the manufacture and distribution of controlled substances.  Title 21 U.S.C. § 841(a) provides:\\n\\n\\n34\\n\"Except as authorized by this subchapter, it shall be      unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally—\\n\\n\\n35\\n\"(1) to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess      with intent to manufacture, distribute or dispense, a      controlled substance. . . .\"\\n\\n\\n36\\nI am sure that the Members of the majority would agree that a defendant charged under this provision could not defend on the ground that he did not realize his manufacture was unauthorized or that the particular substance was controlled.  See United States v. Balint, 258 U.S. 250, 42 S.Ct. 301, 66 L.Ed. 604 (1922).  On the other hand, it would be a defense if he could prove he thought the substance was something other than what it was.  By the same token, I think, someone in petitioner\\'s position should not be heard to say that he did not know his purchase of food stamps was unauthorized, though he may certainly argue that he did not know he was buying food stamps.  I would not stretch the term \"knowingly\" to require awareness of the absence of statutory authority in either of these provisions.\\n\\n\\n37\\nThese provisions might be distinguished because of the different placements of the \"except as authorized\" and the \"in any manner not authorized\" clauses in the sentences.  But see United States v. Yermian, 468 U.S., at 69, and n. 6, 104 S.Ct., at 2940, and n. 6.  However, nothing in the majority\\'s opinion indicates that this difference is relevant.  Indeed, the logic of the Court\\'s opinion would require knowledge of illegality for conviction under any statute making it a crime to do something \"in any manner not authorized by law\" or \"unlawfully.\"  I suspect that if a case arises in the future where such a result is unacceptable, the Court will manage to distinguish today\\'s decision.  But I will be interested to see how it does so.\\n\\nIII\\n\\n38\\nIn relying on the \"background assumption of our criminal law\" that mens rea is required, ante, at 426, the Court ignores the equally well founded assumption that ignorance of the law is no excuse.  It is \"the conventional position that knowledge of the existence, meaning or application of the law determining the elements of an offense is not an element of that offense. . . .\" Model Penal Code, supra, at 130.\\n\\n\\n39\\nThis Court\\'s prior cases indicate that a statutory requirement of a \"knowing violation\" does not supersede this principle.  For example, under the statute at issue in United States v. International Minerals & Chemical Corp., 402 U.S. 558, 91 S.Ct. 1697, 29 L.Ed.2d 178 (1971), the Interstate Commerce Commission was authorized to promulgate regulations regarding the transportation of corrosive liquids, and it was a crime to \"knowingly violat[e] any such regulation.\"  18 U.S.C. § 834(f) (1970 ed.).  Viewing the word \"regulations\" as \"a shorthand designation for specific acts or omissions which violate the Act,\" 402 U.S., at 562, 91 S.Ct., at 1700, we adhered to the traditional rule that ignorance of the law is not a defense.  The violation had to be \"knowing\" in that the defendant had to know that he was transporting corrosive liquids and not, for example, merely water. Id., at 563-564, 91 S.Ct., at 1700-1701.  But there was no requirement that he be aware that he was violating a particular regulation. Similarly, in this case the phrase \"in any manner not authorized by\" the statute or regulations is a shorthand incorporation of a variety of legal requirements.  To be convicted, a defendant must have been aware of what he was doing, but not that it was illegal.\\n\\n\\n40\\nIn Boyce Motor Lines, Inc. v. United States, 342 U.S. 337, 72 S.Ct. 329, 96 L.Ed. 367 (1952), the Court considered a statute that punished anyone who \"knowingly violates\" a regulation requiring trucks transporting dangerous items to avoid congested areas where possible.  In rejecting a vagueness challenge, the Court read \"knowingly\" to mean not that the driver had to be aware of the regulation, see id., at 345, 72 S.Ct., at 333 (Jackson, J., dissenting), but that he had to know a safer alternative route was available.  Likewise, in construing 18 U.S.C. § 1461, which punishes \"[w]hoever knowingly uses the mails for the mailing . . . of anything declared by this section or section 3001(e) of Title 39 to be nonmailable,\" we held that the defendant need not have known that the materials were nonmailable.  Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 120-124, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 2909-2911, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974).  \"To require proof of a defendant\\'s knowledge of the legal status of the materials would permit the defendant to avoid prosecution by simply claiming that he had not brushed up on the law,\" and was not required by the statute.  Id., at 123-124, 94 S.Ct., at 2910-2911.  Accord, Rosen v. United States, 161 U.S. 29, 16 S.Ct. 434, 40 L.Ed. 606 (1896).  See also United States v. Freed, 401 U.S. 601, 91 S.Ct. 1112, 28 L.Ed.2d 356 (1971);  id., at 612-615, 91 S.Ct., at 1119-1121 (BRENNAN, J., concurring in judgment).\\n\\n\\n41\\nIn each of these cases, the statutory language lent itself to the approach adopted today if anything more readily than does § 2024(b)(1).6  I would read § 2024(b)(1) like those statutes, to require awareness of only the relevant aspects of one\\'s conduct rendering it illegal, not the fact of illegality.  This reading does not abandon the \"background assumption\" of mens rea by creating a strict-liability offense,7 and is consistent with the equally important background assumption that ignorance of the law is not a defense.\\n\\nIV\\n\\n42\\nI wholly agree that \"[t]he contention that an injury can amount to a crime only when inflicted by intention is no provincial or transient notion.\"   Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 250, 72 S.Ct. 240, 243, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952);  ante, at 425.  But the holding of the court below is not at all inconsistent with that longstanding and important principle. Petitioner\\'s conduct was intentional;  the jury found that petitioner \"realized what he was doing, and was aware of the nature of his conduct, and did not act through ignorance, mistake, or accident.\"  App. 33 (trial court\\'s instructions).  Whether he knew which regulation he violated is beside the point.\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n The statute provides in relevant part:\\n\"[W]hoever knowingly uses, transfers, acquires, alters, or possesses coupons or authorization cards in any manner not authorized by this chapter or the regulations issued pursuant to this chapter shall, if such coupons or authorization cards are of a value of $100 or more, be guilty of a felony and shall, upon the first conviction thereof, be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both, and, upon the second and any subsequent conviction thereof, shall be imprisoned for not less than six months nor more than five years and may also be fined not more than $10,000 or, if such coupons or authorization cards are of a value of less than $100, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon the first conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both, and upon the second and any subsequent conviction thereof, shall be imprisoned for not more than one year and may also be fined not more than $1,000.  In addition to such penalties, any person convicted of a felony or misdemeanor violation under this subsection may be suspended by the court from participation in the food stamp program for an additional period of up to eighteen months consecutive to that period of suspension mandated by section 2015(b)(1) of this title.\"\\n\\n\\n2\\n Food stamps are provided by the Government to those who meet certain need-related criteria.  See 7 U.S.C. §§ 2014(a), 2014(c).  They generally may be used only to purchase food in retail food stores.  7 U.S.C. § 2016(b).  If a restaurant receives proper authorization from the Department of Agriculture, it may receive food stamps as payment for meals under certain special circumstances not relevant here.  App. 6-7.\\n\\n\\n3\\n The instruction proffered by petitioner was drawn from 1 E. Devitt & C. Blackmar, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions § 14.03 (1977).  The instruction reads in its entirety:\\n\"The crime charged in this case is a serious crime which requires proof of specific intent before the defendant can be convicted.  Specific intent, as the term implies, means more than the general intent to commit the act.  To establish specific intent the government must prove that the defendant knowingly did an act which the law forbids, purposely intending to violate the law.  Such intent may be determined from all the facts and circumstances surrounding the case.\"\\n\\n\\n4\\n See United States v. Pollard, 724 F.2d 1438 (CA6 1984); United States v. Marvin, 687 F.2d 1221 (CA8 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1081, 103 S.Ct. 1768, 76 L.Ed.2d 342 (1983);  United States v. Faltico, 687 F.2d 273 (CA8 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1088, 103 S.Ct. 1783, 76 L.Ed.2d 353 (1983);  United States v. O\\'Brien, 686 F.2d 850 (CA10 1982).\\n\\n\\n5\\n The required mental state may of course be different for different elements of a crime.  United States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394, 405-406, 100 S.Ct. 624, 631-633, 62 L.Ed.2d 575 (1980); United States v. Freed, 401 U.S. 601, 612-614, 91 S.Ct. 1112, 1119-1121, 28 L.Ed.2d 356 (1971) (BRENNAN, J., concurring in judgment).  See generally Robinson & Grall, Element Analysis in Defining Criminal Liability:  The Model Penal Code and Beyond, 35 Stan.L.Rev. 681 (1983).  In this case, for instance, both parties agree that petitioner must have known that he acquired and possessed food stamps.  They disagree over whether any mental element at all is required with respect to the unauthorized nature of that acquisition or possession.\\nWe have also recognized that the mental element in criminal law encompasses more than the two possibilities of \"specific\" and \"general\" intent.  See United States v. Bailey, supra, 444 U.S., at 403-407, 100 S.Ct., at 631-633;  United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 444-445, 98 S.Ct. 2864, 2877-2878, 57 L.Ed.2d 854 (1978);  United States v. Freed, supra, 401 U.S., at 613, 91 S.Ct., at 1120 (BRENNAN, J., concurring in judgment).  The Model Penal Code, for instance, recognizes four mental states purpose, knowledge, recklessness, and negligence.  ALI, Model Penal Code § 2.02 (Prop.Off.Draft 1962).  In this case, petitioner argues that with respect to the element at issue, knowledge is required.  The Government contends that no mental state is required with respect to that element.\\n\\n\\n6\\n Of course, Congress must act within any applicable constitutional constraints in defining criminal offenses.  In this case, there is no allegation that the statute would be unconstitutional under either interpretation.\\n\\n\\n7\\n One treatise has aptly summed up the ambiguity in an analogous situation:\\n\"Still further difficulty arises from the ambiguity which frequently exists concerning what the words or phrases in question modify.  What, for instance, does \\'knowingly\\' modify in a sentence from a \\'blue sky\\' law criminal statute punishing one who \\'knowingly sells a security without a permit\\' from the securities commissioner?  To be guilty must the seller of a security without a permit know only that what he is doing constitutes a sale, or must he also know that the thing he sells is a security, or must he also know that he has no permit to sell the security he sells? As a matter of grammar the statute is ambiguous;  it is not at all clear how far down the sentence the word \\'knowingly\\' is intended to travel—whether it modifies \\'sells,\\' or \\'sells a security,\\' or \\'sells a security without a permit.\\' \"  W. LaFave & A. Scott, Criminal Law § 27 (1972).\\n\\n\\n8\\n See n. 12, infra.\\n\\n\\n9\\n The dissent repeatedly claims that our holding today creates a defense of \"mistake of law.\"  Post, at 436, 439, 441. Our holding today no more creates a \"mistake of law\" defense than does a statute making knowing receipt of stolen goods unlawful. See post, at 436.  In both cases, there is a legal element in the definition of the offense.  In the case of a receipt-of-stolen-goods statute, the legal element is that the goods were stolen;  in this case, the legal element is that the \"use, transfer, acquisition,\" etc. were in a manner not authorized by statute or regulations.  It is not a defense to a charge of receipt of stolen goods that one did not know that such receipt was illegal, and it is not a defense to a charge of a § 2024(b)(1) violation that one did not know that possessing food stamps in a manner unauthorized by statute or regulations was illegal.  It is, however, a defense to a charge of knowing receipt of stolen goods that one did not know that the goods were stolen, just as it is a defense to a charge of a § 2024(b)(1) violation that one did not know that one\\'s possession was unauthorized.  See ALI, Model Penal Code § 2.02, Comment 11, p. 131 (Tent. Draft No. 4, 1955);  United States v. Freed, supra, at 614-615, 91 S.Ct., at 1120-1121 (BRENNAN, J., concurring in judgment).  Cf. Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952) (holding that it is a defense to a charge of \"knowingly converting\" federal property that one did not know that what one was doing was a conversion).\\n\\n\\n10\\n As the Committee Report in the House of Representatives noted when this provision in essentially its current form was first enacted, the provision \"makes it clear that participants shall be charged the regular price prevailing in the retail store when they purchase food with stamps.\"  H.R.Rep. No. 1228, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 14 (1964).  See also S.Rep. No. 1124, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 15 (1964), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1964, pp. 3275, 3289.\\n\\n\\n11\\n The Department of Agriculture\\'s regulations permit state agencies administering the food stamp program to mail the coupons directly to program participants.  The regulations provide that \"[t]he State agency may issue some or all of the coupon allotments through the mail.\"  7 CFR § 274.3(a) (1985).\\n\\n\\n12\\n The statute provides in full:\\n\"Whoever presents, or causes to be presented, coupons for payment or redemption of the value of $100 or more, knowing the same to have been received, transferred, or used in any manner in violation of the provisions of this chapter or the regulations issued pursuant to this chapter, shall be guilty of a felony and, upon the first conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both, and, upon the second and any subsequent conviction thereof, shall be imprisoned for not less than one year nor more than five years and may also be fined not more than $10,000, or, if such coupons are of a value of less than $100, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon the first conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both, and, upon the second and any subsequent conviction thereof, shall be imprisoned for not more than one year and may also be fined not more than $1,000.  In addition to such penalties, any person convicted of a felony or misdemeanor violation under this subsection may be suspended by the court from participation in the food stamp program for an additional period of up to eighteen months consecutive to that period of suspension mandated by section 2015(b)(1) of this title.\"\\nIt is worth noting that the penalties under this section are virtually identical to those provided in § 2024(b)(1).  See n. 1, supra.\\n\\n\\n13\\n Notwithstanding the absence of any explicit discussion of this issue in the legislative history, the Government argues that certain statements in the Committee Reports support its position. The statute originally was enacted as part of the Food Stamp Act of 1964, Pub.L. 88-525, § 14, 78 Stat. 708.  The Committee Report accompanying the bill in the House of Representatives described both sections together:  \"This section makes it a violation of Federal law to knowingly use, transfer, acquire, or possess coupons in any manner not authorized by this act or to present, or cause to be presented, such coupons for redemption knowing them to have been received, transferred or used in any manner in violation of the provisions of the act.\"  H.R.Rep. No. 1228, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 16 (1964).  See also S.Rep. No. 1124, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 18 (1964), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News p. 3291.  The Government believes that the description of both sections in this single sentence emphasizes the difference in meaning between them.  We fail to see how this sentence, which merely parrots the terms of the statute, offers any enlightenment as to what those terms mean.\\nThe Government similarly points to the legislative history of the 1977 Act that substantially revised the previous food stamp program.  The House Report explained that \"[a]ny unauthorized use, transfer, acquisition, alteration, or possession of food stamps . . . by any individual . . . may be prosecuted under the provisions of\" § 2024(b)(1).  H.R.Rep. No. 95-464, p. 376 (1977), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News pp. 1704, 2305.  The Report continued that \"under [§ 2024(c) ] . . . the same penalties are prescribed for whoever presents or causes to be presented food stamps (for payment or redemption) knowing that they have been received, transferred or used in any manner violating the provisions of the Act or regulations implementing the Act.\"  Ibid.\\nPresumably relying on the omission of the word \"knowingly\" in its description of § 2024(b)(1), the Government argues that this language indicates that \"the difference between Sections 2024(b) and 2024(c) was plainly visible to Congress and that Congress was fully aware of the scope of the former provision. . . .\"  Brief for United States 20.  We do not believe that the omission of the word \"knowingly\" is evidence that Congress devoted its attention to the issue before the Court today;  it is as likely that the Committee, unaware of the problem, simply did not realize the need to discuss the mental element needed for a conviction under § 2024(b)(1).  Moreover, the omission of the word \"knowingly\" in the description of § 2024(b)(1) would indicate, if anything, an intent to dispense with any requirement of knowledge in § 2024(b)(1), an intent that is at odds with the language of the statute and the interpretation urged even by the Government today.  The omission of the word \"knowingly\" thus provides no support for the argument that Congress intended not to require knowledge of illegality in a § 2024(b)(1) prosecution.\\n\\n\\n14\\n The statute provides:\\n\"Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\"\\n\\n\\n15\\n The fact that both parties in Yermian agreed that the Government had to prove that the defendant had \"knowingly and willfully\" made a false statement does not of course indicate that the parties agreed on the mental state applicable to other elements of the offense.  See post, at 435 (WHITE, J., dissenting).  What it does mean is that in Yermian, unlike this case, all parties agreed that an \"evil-meaning mind\" was required with respect at least to one element of the crime.\\n\\n\\n16\\n Although we agree with petitioner concerning his interpretation of the statute, we express no opinion on the \"specific intent\" instruction he tendered, see n. 3, supra.  This instruction has been criticized as too general and potentially misleading, see United States v. Arambasich, 597 F.2d 609, 613 (CA7 1979).  A more useful instruction might relate specifically to the mental state required under § 2024(b)(1) and eschew use of difficult legal concepts like \"specific intent\" and \"general intent.\"\\n\\n\\n17\\n In this case, for instance, the Government introduced evidence that petitioner bought food stamps at a substantial discount from face value and that he conducted part of the transaction in a back room of his restaurant to avoid the presence of the other patrons.  Moreover, the Government asserts that food stamps themselves are stamped \"nontransferable.\"  Brief for United States 34.  A jury could have inferred from this evidence that petitioner knew that his acquisition and possession of the stamps were unauthorized.\\n\\n\\n1\\n The majority\\'s efforts to distinguish Yermian are unavailing.  First, it points out that under the statute at issue there, the prosecution had to establish some mens rea because it had to show a knowing falsehood.  Ante, at 431-432.  However, as the majority itself points out elsewhere, ante, at 423-424, n. 5, different mental states can apply to different elements of an offense.  The fact that in Yermian mens rea had to be proved as to the first element was irrelevant to the Court\\'s holding that it did not with regard to the second.  There is no reason to read this statute differently.  Second, the majority states that the language in Yermian was \"unambiguous.\"  Ante, at 432.  Since it is identical, the language at issue in this case can be no less so. Finally, the majority notes, ibid., that the Court in Yermian did not decide whether the prosecution might have to prove that the defendant \"should have known\" that his statements were within the agency\\'s jurisdiction.  468 U.S., at 75, n. 14, 104 S.Ct., at 2943, n. 14.  However, that passing statement was irrelevant to the interpretation of the statute\\'s language the Court did undertake.\\n\\n\\n2\\n Under the agency\\'s interpretation of the statute, as evidenced in the regulations, it is not at all clear that such a person would in fact be violating the statute.  The regulation referred to by the majority, 7 CFR § 274.10(a) (1985), states that \"coupons may be used only by the household . . . to purchase eligible food for the household.\"  The prevailing price requirement is mentioned only in a section that applies to participating stores:  \"Coupons shall be accepted for eligible foods at the same prices and on the same terms and conditions applicable to cash purchases of the same foods at the same store.\" § 278.2(b).  For purposes of illustration, however, I will accept that not only overcharging, but also being overcharged, violates the statute.\\n\\n\\n3\\n The appropriate prosecutorial target in such a situation would of course be the seller rather than the purchaser.  I have no doubt that every prosecutor in the country would agree.  The discussion of this hypothetical is wholly academic.\\nFor similar reasons, I am unmoved by the specter of criminal liability for someone who is mistakenly mailed food stamps and throws them out, see ante, at 426-427, and do not think the hypothetical offers much of a guide to congressional intent.  We should proceed on the assumption that Congress had in mind the run-of-the-mill situation, not its most bizarre mutation. Arguments that presume wildly unreasonable conduct by Government officials are by their nature unconvincing, and reliance on them is likely to do more harm than good.  United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277, 284-285, 64 S.Ct. 134, 138-139, 88 L.Ed. 48 (1943).  No rule, including that adopted by the Court today, is immune from such contrived defects.\\n\\n\\n4\\n The Court asserts that the distinction would be meaningless because anyone who has violated subsection (c) will necessarily have violated subsection (b)(1) as well by \"present[ing], or caus[ing] to be presented, coupons for payment or redemption\" in an unauthorized manner.  Ante, at 429.  However, subsection (c) forbids presenting coupons knowing that they have been improperly used or acquired in the past.  The manner of acquisition and presentation by the offender may be perfectly proper;  the point is that the coupons are in a sense tainted by the prior transaction.  Thus, if a check-out clerk accepts stamps for ineligible items, thereby violating § 2024(b)(1), and his employer collects the stamps and presents them for redemption in the normal course of business, it would not seem that the latter has violated § 2024(b)(1).  He has done nothing in a manner not authorized by law.  He has violated subsection (c) if, but only if, he knew of the clerk\\'s wrongdoing.  It may be that merely by violating subsection (c) a grocer also violates subsection (b)(1); but absent the violation of subsection (c), I do not see how the grocer would violate subsection (b)(1) in such a case.\\n\\n\\n5\\n Similarly, it is a valid defense to a charge of theft that the defendant thought the property legally belonged to him, even if that belief is incorrect.  But this is not because ignorance of the law is an excuse.  Rather, \"the legal element involved is simply an aspect of the attendant circumstances, with respect to which knowledge . . . is required for culpability. . . .  The law involved is not the law defining the offense;  it is some other legal rule that characterizes the attendant circumstances that are material to the offense.\"  ALI, Model Penal Code § 2.02, Comment 11, p. 131 (Tent. Draft No. 4, 1955).  Accord, United States v. Freed, 401 U.S. 601, 614-615, 91 S.Ct. 1112, 1120-1121, 28 L.Ed.2d 356 (1971) (BRENNAN, J., concurring in judgment).  Cf. Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952).\\n\\n\\n6\\n The Court distinguishes these as \"public welfare offense\" cases involving inherently dangerous articles of commerce whose users should have assumed were subject to regulation.  Ante, at 432-433.  But see United States v. Freed, 401 U.S., at 612, 91 S.Ct., at 1119 (BRENNAN, J., concurring in judgment).  Apart from the fact that a reasonable person would also assume food stamps are heavily regulated and not subject to sale and exchange, this distinction is not related to the actual holdings in those cases. The Court\\'s opinion in Boyce and the concurrence in Freed do not discuss this consideration.  And the Court\\'s references to the dangerousness of the goods in International Minerals were directed to possible due process challenges to convictions without notice of criminality.  402 U.S., at 564-565, 91 S.Ct., at 1701-1702.  As today\\'s majority acknowledges, ante, at 424, n. 6, there is no constitutional defect with the holding of the court below.  The only issue here is one of congressional intent.\\n\\n\\n7\\n Under a strict-liability statute, a defendant can be convicted even though he was unaware of the circumstances of his conduct that made it illegal.  To take the example of a statute recently before the Court, a regulation forbidding hunting birds in a \"baited\" field can be read to have a scienter requirement, in which case it would be a defense to prove that one did not know the field was baited, or not, in which case someone hunting in such a field is guilty even if he did not know and could not have known that it was baited.  See Catlett v. United States, 471 U.S. 1074, 105 S.Ct. 2153, 85 L.Ed.2d 509 (1985) (WHITE, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).  I do not argue that the latter approach should be taken to this statute, nor would the statutory language allow it.\\n\\n\\n'}]\n",

UNITED STATES\\n\\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\\n                 THE SECOND CIRCUIT\\n\\n   No. 16–1144. Argued December 6, 2017—Decided March 21, 2018\\nBetween 2004 and 2009, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intermit-\\n  tently investigated petitioner Marinello’s tax activities. In 2012, the\\n  Government indicted Marinello for violating, among other criminal\\n  tax statutes, a provision in 26 U. S. C. §7212(a) known as the Omni-\\n  bus Clause, which forbids “corruptly or by force or threats of force . . .\\n  obstruct[ing] or imped[ing], or endeavor[ing] to obstruct or impede,\\n  the due administration of [the Internal Revenue Code].” The judge\\n  instructed the jury that, to convict Marinello of an Omnibus Clause\\n  violation, it must find that he “corruptly” engaged in at least one of\\n  eight specified activities, but the jury was not told that it needed to\\n  find that Marinello knew he was under investigation and intended\\n  corruptly to interfere with that investigation. Marinello was convict-\\n  ed. The Second Circuit affirmed, rejecting his claim that an Omnibus\\n  Clause violation requires the Government to show the defendant\\n  tried to interfere with a pending IRS proceeding, such as a particular\\n  investigation.\\nHeld: To convict a defendant under the Omnibus Clause, the Govern-\\n  ment must prove the defendant was aware of a pending tax-related\\n  proceeding, such as a particular investigation or audit, or could rea-\\n  sonably foresee that such a proceeding would commence. Pp. 3–11.\\n     (a) In United States v. Aguilar, 515 U. S. 593, this Court interpret-\\n  ed a similarly worded criminal statute—which made it a felony “cor-\\n  ruptly or by threats or force . . . [to] influenc[e], obstruc[t], or\\n  imped[e], or endeavo[r] to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due ad-\\n  ministration of justice,” 18 U. S. C. §1503(a). There, the Court re-\\n  quired the Government to show there was a “nexus” between the de-\\n  fendant’s obstructive conduct and a particular judicial proceeding.\\n  The Court said that the defendant’s “act must have a relationship in\\n\\x0c2                   MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                                  Syllabus\\n\\n    time, causation, or logic with the judicial proceedings.” 515 U. S., at\\n    599. In reaching this conclusion, the Court emphasized that it has\\n    “traditionally exercised restraint in assessing the reach of a federal\\n    criminal statute, both out of deference to the prerogatives of Congress\\n    and out of concern that ‘a fair warning should be given to the world\\n    in language that the common world will understand, of what the law\\n    intends to do if a certain line is passed.’ ” Id., at 600. That reasoning\\n    applies here with similar strength. The verbs “obstruct” and “im-\\n    pede” require an object. The taxpayer must hinder a particular per-\\n    son or thing. The object in §7212(a) is the “due administration of [the\\n    Tax Code].” That phrase is best viewed, like the “due administration\\n    of justice” in Aguilar, as referring to discrete targeted administrative\\n    acts rather than every conceivable task involved in the Tax Code’s\\n    administration. Statutory context confirms this reading. The Omni-\\n    bus Clause appears in the middle of a sentence that refers to efforts\\n    to “intimidate or impede any officer or employee of the United States\\n    acting in an official capacity.” §7212(a). The first part of the sen-\\n    tence also refers to “force or threats of force,” which the statute else-\\n    where defines as “threats of bodily harm to the officer or employee of\\n    the United States or to a member of his family.” Ibid. And §7212(b)\\n    refers to the “forcibl[e] rescu[e]” of “any property after it shall have\\n    been seized under” the Internal Revenue Code. Subsections (a) and\\n    (b) thus refer to corrupt or forceful actions taken against individual\\n    identifiable persons or property. In context, the Omnibus Clause log-\\n    ically serves as a “catchall” for the obstructive conduct the subsection\\n    sets forth, not for every violation that interferes with routine admin-\\n    istrative procedures such as the processing of tax returns, receipt of\\n    tax payments, or issuance of tax refunds. The statute’s legislative\\n    history does not suggest otherwise. The broader context of the full\\n    Internal Revenue Code also counsels against a broad reading. Inter-\\n    preting the Omnibus Clause to apply to all Code administration could\\n    transform the Code’s numerous misdemeanor provisions into felonies,\\n    making them redundant or perhaps the subject matter of plea bar-\\n    gaining. It could also result in a similar lack of fair warning and re-\\n    lated kinds of unfairness that led this Court to “exercise” interpretive\\n    “restraint” in Aguilar. See 515 U. S., at 600. The Government claims\\n    that the “corrupt state of mind” requirement will cure any over-\\n    breadth problem, but it is difficult to imagine a scenario when that\\n    requirement will make a practical difference in the context of federal\\n    tax prosecutions. And to rely on prosecutorial discretion to narrow\\n    the otherwise wide-ranging scope of a criminal statute’s general lan-\\n    guage places too much power in the prosecutor’s hands. Pp. 3–9.\\n       (b) Following the same approach taken in similar cases, the Gov-\\n    ernment here must show that there is a “nexus” between the defend-\\n\\x0c                     Cite as: 584 U.

See\\n  Aguilar, supra, at 599. The term “particular administrative proceed-\\n  ing” does not mean every act carried out by IRS employees in the\\n  course of their administration of the Tax Code. Just because a tax-\\n  payer knows that the IRS will review her tax return annually does\\n  not transform every Tax Code violation into an obstruction charge.\\n  In addition to satisfying the nexus requirement, the Government\\n  must show that the proceeding was pending at the time the defend-\\n  ant engaged in the obstructive conduct or, at the least, was then rea-\\n  sonably foreseeable by the defendant.

S. C. §7212(a). The question here concerns the\\nbreadth of that statutory phrase. Does it cover virtually\\nall governmental efforts to collect taxes? Or does it have a\\nnarrower scope? In our view, “due administration of [the\\nTax Code]” does not cover routine administrative proce-\\ndures that are near-universally applied to all taxpayers,\\nsuch as the ordinary processing of income tax returns.\\nRather, the clause as a whole refers to specific interference\\nwith targeted governmental tax-related proceedings, such\\nas a particular investigation or audit.\\n                               I\\n  The Internal Revenue Code provision at issue, §7212(a),\\nhas two substantive clauses. The first clause, which we\\nshall call the “Officer Clause,” forbids\\n    “corruptly or by force or threats of force (including any\\n    threatening letter or communication) endeavor[ing] to\\n    intimidate or impede any officer or employee of the\\n\\x0c2              MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                      Opinion of the Court\\n\\n    United States acting in an official capacity under [the\\n    Internal Revenue Code].” Ibid. (emphasis added).\\nThe second clause, which we shall call the “Omnibus\\nClause,” forbids\\n    “corruptly or by force or threats of force (including any\\n    threatening letter or communication) obstruct[ing] or\\n    imped[ing], or endeavor[ing] to obstruct or impede, the\\n    due administration of [the Internal Revenue Code].”\\n    Ibid. (emphasis added).\\nAs we said at the outset, we here consider the scope of the\\nOmnibus Clause. (We have placed the full text of §7212 in\\nthe Appendix, infra.)\\n    Between 2004 and 2009, the Internal Revenue Service\\n(IRS) opened, then closed, then reopened an investigation\\ninto the tax activities of Carlo Marinello, the petitioner\\nhere. In 2012 the Government indicted Marinello, charg-\\ning him with violations of several criminal tax statutes\\nincluding the Omnibus Clause. In respect to the Omnibus\\nClause the Government claimed that Marinello had en-\\ngaged in at least one of eight different specified activities,\\nincluding “failing to maintain corporate books and rec-\\nords,” “failing to provide” his tax accountant “with com-\\nplete and accurate” tax “information,” “destroying . . .\\nbusiness records,” “hiding income,” and “paying employees\\n. . . with cash.” 839 F. 3d 209, 213 (CA2 2016).\\n    Before the jury retired to consider the charges, the judge\\ninstructed it that, to convict Marinello of violating the\\nOmnibus Clause, it must find unanimously that he en-\\ngaged in at least one of the eight practices just mentioned,\\nthat the jurors need not agree on which one, and that he\\ndid so “corruptly,” meaning “with the intent to secure an\\nunlawful advantage or benefit, either for [himself] or for\\nanother.” App. in No. 15–2224 (CA2), p. 432. The judge,\\nhowever, did not instruct the jury that it must find that\\nMarinello knew he was under investigation and intended\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)            3\\n\\n                     Opinion of the Court\\n\\ncorruptly to interfere with that investigation. The jury\\nsubsequently convicted Marinello on all counts.\\n   Marinello appealed to the Court of Appeals for the\\nSecond Circuit. He argued, among other things, that a\\nviolation of the Omnibus Clause requires the Government\\nto show that the defendant had tried to interfere with a\\n“pending IRS proceeding,” such as a particular investiga-\\ntion. Brief for Appellant in No. 15–2224, pp. 23–25. The\\nappeals court disagreed. It held that a defendant need not\\npossess “ ‘an awareness of a particular [IRS] action or\\ninvestigation.’ ” 839 F. 3d, at 221 (quoting United States v.\\nWood, 384 Fed. Appx. 698, 704 (CA2 2010); alteration in\\noriginal). The full Court of Appeals rejected Marinello’s\\npetition for rehearing, two judges dissenting. 855 F. 3d\\n455 (CA2 2017).\\n   Marinello then petitioned for certiorari, asking us to\\ndecide whether the Omnibus Clause requires the Govern-\\nment to prove the defendant was aware of “a pending IRS\\naction or proceeding, such as an investigation or audit,”\\nwhen he “engaged in the purportedly obstructive conduct.”\\nPet. for Cert. i. In light of a division of opinion among the\\nCircuits on this point, we granted the petition. Compare\\nUnited States v. Kassouf, 144 F. 3d 952 (CA6 1998) (re-\\nquiring showing of a pending proceeding), with 839 F. 3d,\\nat 221 (disagreeing with Kassouf ).\\n                             II\\n  In United States v. Aguilar, 515 U. S. 593 (1995), we\\ninterpreted a similarly worded criminal statute. That\\nstatute made it a felony “corruptly or by threats or force,\\nor by any threatening letter or communication, [to] influ-\\nenc[e], obstruc[t], or imped[e], or endeavo[r] to influence,\\nobstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice.” 18\\nU. S. C. §1503(a). The statute concerned not (as here) “the\\ndue administration of ” the Internal Revenue Code but\\nrather “the due administration of justice.” (We have\\n\\x0c4              MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                     Opinion of the Court\\n\\nplaced the full text of §1503 in the Appendix, infra.)\\n   In interpreting that statute we pointed to earlier cases\\nin which courts had held that the Government must prove\\n“an intent to influence judicial or grand jury proceedings.”\\nAguilar, supra, at 599 (citing United States v. Brown, 688\\nF. 2d 596, 598 (CA9 1982)). We noted that some courts\\nhad imposed a “ ‘nexus’ requirement”: that the defendant’s\\n“act must have a relationship in time, causation, or logic\\nwith the judicial proceedings.” Aguilar, supra, at 599\\n(citing United States v. Wood, 6 F. 3d 692, 696 (CA10\\n1993), and United States v. Walasek, 527 F. 2d 676,\\n679, and n. 12 (CA3 1975)). And we adopted the same\\nrequirement.\\n   We set forth two important reasons for doing so. We\\nwrote that we “have traditionally exercised restraint in\\nassessing the reach of a federal criminal statute, both out\\nof deference to the prerogatives of Congress and out of\\nconcern that ‘a fair warning should be given to the world\\nin language that the common world will understand, of\\nwhat the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.’ ”\\nAguilar, supra, at 600 (quoting McBoyle v. United States,\\n283 U. S. 25, 27 (1931); citation omitted). Both reasons\\napply here with similar strength.\\n   As to Congress’ intent, the literal language of the stat-\\nute is neutral. The statutory words “obstruct or impede”\\nare broad. They can refer to anything that “block[s],”\\n“make[s] difficult,” or “hinder[s].” Black’s Law Dictionary\\n1246 (10th ed. 2014) (obstruct); Webster’s New Interna-\\ntional Dictionary (Webster’s) 1248 (2d ed. 1954) (impede);\\nid., at 1682 (obstruct); accord, 5 Oxford English Dictionary\\n80 (1933) (impede); 7 id., at 36 (obstruct). But the verbs\\n“obstruct” and “impede” suggest an object—the taxpayer\\nmust hinder a particular person or thing. Here, the object\\nis the “due administration of this title.” The word “admin-\\nistration” can be read literally to refer to every “[a]ct or\\nprocess of administering” including every act of “manag-\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)             5\\n\\n                      Opinion of the Court\\n\\ning” or “conduct[ing]” any “office,” or “performing the\\nexecutive duties of ” any “institution, business, or the like.”\\nWebster’s 34. But the whole phrase—the due administra-\\ntion of the Tax Code—is best viewed, like the due admin-\\nistration of justice, as referring to only some of those acts\\nor to some separable parts of an institution or business.\\nCf. Aguilar, supra, at 600–601 (concluding false state-\\nments made to an investigating agent, rather than a\\ngrand jury, do not support a conviction for obstruction of\\njustice).\\n   Here statutory context confirms that the text refers to\\nspecific, targeted acts of administration. The Omnibus\\nClause appears in the middle of a statutory sentence that\\nrefers specifically to efforts to “intimidate or impede any\\nofficer or employee of the United States acting in an official\\ncapacity.” 26 U. S. C. §7212(a) (emphasis added). The\\nfirst part of the sentence also refers to “force or threats of\\nforce,” which the statute elsewhere defines as “threats of\\nbodily harm to the officer or employee of the United States\\nor to a member of his family.” Ibid. (emphasis added).\\nThe following subsection refers to the “forcibl[e] rescu[e]”\\nof “any property after it shall have been seized under” the\\nInternal Revenue Code.          §7212(b) (emphasis added).\\nSubsections (a) and (b) thus refer to corrupt or forceful\\nactions taken against individual identifiable persons or\\nproperty. And, in that context the Omnibus Clause logi-\\ncally serves as a “catchall” in respect to the obstructive\\nconduct the subsection sets forth, not as a “catchall” for\\nevery violation that interferes with what the Government\\ndescribes as the “continuous, ubiquitous, and universally\\nknown” administration of the Internal Revenue Code.\\nBrief in Opposition 9.\\n   Those who find legislative history helpful can find con-\\nfirmation of the more limited scope of the Omnibus Clause\\nin the House and Senate Reports written when Congress\\nfirst enacted the Omnibus Clause. See H. R. Rep. No.\\n\\x0c6              MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                     Opinion of the Court\\n\\n1337, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. (1954); S. Rep. No. 1622, 83d\\nCong., 2d Sess. (1954). According to the House Report,\\n§7212 “provides for the punishment of threats or threaten-\\ning acts against agents of the Internal Revenue Service, or\\nany other officer or employee of the United States, or\\nmembers of the families of such persons, on account of the\\nperformance by such agents or officers or employees of\\ntheir official duties” and “will also punish the corrupt\\nsolicitation of an internal revenue employee.” H. R. Rep.\\nNo. 1337, at A426 (emphasis added). The Senate Report\\nalso refers to the section as aimed at targeting officers and\\nemployees. It says that §7212 “covers all cases where the\\nofficer is intimidated or injured; that is, where corruptly,\\nby force or threat of force, directly or by communication,\\nan attempt is made to impede the administration of the\\ninternal-revenue laws.” S. Rep. No. 1622, at 147 (empha-\\nsis added). We have found nothing in the statute’s history\\nsuggesting that Congress intended the Omnibus Clause as\\na catchall applicable to the entire Code including the\\nroutine processing of tax returns, receipt of tax payments,\\nand issuance of tax refunds.\\n   Viewing the Omnibus Clause in the broader statutory\\ncontext of the full Internal Revenue Code also counsels\\nagainst adopting the Government’s broad reading. That is\\nbecause the Code creates numerous misdemeanors, rang-\\ning from willful failure to furnish a required statement to\\nemployees, §7204, to failure to keep required records,\\n§7203, to misrepresenting the number of exemptions to\\nwhich an employee is entitled on IRS Form W–4, §7205, to\\nfailure to pay any tax owed, however small the amount,\\n§7203. To interpret the Omnibus Clause as applying to all\\nCode administration would potentially transform many, if\\nnot all, of these misdemeanor provisions into felonies,\\nmaking the specific provisions redundant, or perhaps the\\nsubject matter of plea bargaining. Some overlap in crimi-\\nnal provisions is, of course, inevitable. See, e.g., Sansone\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 584 U.

S. 343, 349 (1965) (affirming\\nconviction for tax evasion despite overlap with other pro-\\nvisions). Indeed, as the dissent notes, post, at 8 (opinion of\\nTHOMAS, J.), Marinello’s preferred reading of §7212 poten-\\ntially overlaps with another provision of federal law that\\ncriminalizes the obstruction of the “due and proper admin-\\nistration of the law under which any pending proceeding is\\nbeing had before any department or agency of the United\\nStates,” 18 U. S. C. §1505. But we have not found any\\ncase from this Court interpreting a statutory provision\\nthat would create overlap and redundancy to the degree\\nthat would result from the Government’s broad reading of\\n§7212—particularly when it would “ ‘render superfluous\\nother provisions in the same enactment.’ ” Freytag v.\\nCommissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 877 (1991) (quoting Pennsyl-\\nvania Dept. of Public Welfare v. Davenport, 495 U. S. 552,\\n562 (1990); see also Yates v. United States, 574 U. S. ___,\\n___ (2015) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 13).\\n   A broad interpretation would also risk the lack of fair\\nwarning and related kinds of unfairness that led this\\nCourt in Aguilar to “exercise” interpretive “restraint.” See\\n515 U.

Interpreted broadly, the provi-\\nsion could apply to a person who pays a babysitter $41 per\\nweek in cash without withholding taxes, see 26 CFR\\n§31.3102–1(a)(2017); IRS, Publication 926, pp. 5–6 (2018),\\nleaves a large cash tip in a restaurant, fails to keep dona-\\ntion receipts from every charity to which he or she con-\\ntributes, or fails to provide every record to an accountant.\\nSuch an individual may sometimes believe that, in doing\\nso, he is running the risk of having violated an IRS rule,\\nbut we sincerely doubt he would believe he is facing a\\npotential felony prosecution for tax obstruction. Had\\nCongress intended that outcome, it would have spoken\\nwith more clarity than it did in §7212(a).\\n\\x0c8              MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                      Opinion of the Court\\n\\n  The Government argues that the need to show the\\ndefendant’s obstructive conduct was done “corruptly” will\\ncure any overbreadth problem. But we do not see how.\\nThe Government asserts that “corruptly” means acting\\nwith “the specific intent to obtain an unlawful advantage”\\nfor the defendant or another. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37;\\naccord, 839 F. 3d, at 218. Yet, practically speaking, we\\nstruggle to imagine a scenario where a taxpayer would\\n“willfully” violate the Tax Code (the mens rea requirement\\nof various tax crimes, including misdemeanors, see, e.g.,\\n26 U. S. C. §§7203, 7204, 7207) without intending someone\\nto obtain an unlawful advantage. See Cheek v. United\\nStates, 498 U. S. 192, 201 (1991) (“Willfulness . . . requires\\nthe Government to prove that the law imposed a duty on\\nthe defendant, that the defendant knew of this duty, and\\nthat he voluntarily and intentionally violated that duty”)\\nA taxpayer may know with a fair degree of certainty that\\nher babysitter will not declare a cash payment as in-\\ncome—and, if so, a jury could readily find that the taxpayer\\nacted to obtain an unlawful benefit for another. For the\\nsame reason, we find unconvincing the dissent’s argument\\nthat the distinction between “willfully” and “corruptly”—at\\nleast as defined by the Government—reflects any mean-\\ningful difference in culpability. See post, at 6–7.\\n  Neither can we rely upon prosecutorial discretion to\\nnarrow the statute’s scope. True, the Government used\\nthe Omnibus Clause only sparingly during the first few\\ndecades after its enactment. But it used the clause more\\noften after the early 1990’s. Brief for Petitioner 9. And,\\nat oral argument the Government told us that, where\\nmore punitive and less punitive criminal provisions both\\napply to a defendant’s conduct, the Government will\\ncharge a violation of the more punitive provision as long\\nas it can readily prove that violation at trial.

Doing so risks\\nallowing “policemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue\\ntheir personal predilections,” Smith v. Goguen, 415 U. S.\\n566, 575 (1974), which could result in the nonuniform\\nexecution of that power across time and geographic loca-\\ntion. And insofar as the public fears arbitrary prosecution,\\nit risks undermining necessary confidence in the criminal\\njustice system. That is one reason why we have said that\\nwe “cannot construe a criminal statute on the assumption\\nthat the Government will ‘use it responsibly.’ ” McDonnell\\nv. United States, 579 U. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 23)\\n(quoting United States v. Stevens, 559 U. S. 460, 480\\n(2010)). And it is why “[w]e have traditionally exercised\\nrestraint in assessing the reach of a federal criminal stat-\\nute.” Aguilar, supra, at 600.\\n                             III\\n   In sum, we follow the approach we have taken in similar\\ncases in interpreting §7212(a)’s Omnibus Clause. To be\\nsure, the language and history of the provision at issue\\nhere differ somewhat from that of other obstruction provi-\\nsions we have considered in the past. See Aguilar, supra\\n(interpreting a statute prohibiting the obstruction of “the\\ndue administration of justice”); Arthur Andersen, supra\\n(interpreting a statute prohibiting the destruction of an\\nobject with intent to impair its integrity or availability for\\nuse in an official proceeding); Yates, supra (interpreting a\\nstatute prohibiting the destruction, concealment, or cover-\\ning up of any “record, document, or tangible object with\\nthe intent to” obstruct the “investigation or proper admin-\\nistration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any\\n\\x0c10             MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                     Opinion of the Court\\n\\ndepartment or agency of the United States”). The Gov-\\nernment and the dissent urge us to ignore these prece-\\ndents because of those differences. The dissent points out,\\nfor example, that the predecessor to the obstruction stat-\\nute we interpreted in Aguilar, 18 U. S. C. §1503, prohibited\\ninfluencing, intimidating, or impeding “any witness or\\nofficer in any court of the United States” or endeavoring\\n“to obstruct or imped[e] the due administration of justice\\ntherein.” Pettibone v. United States, 148 U. S. 197, 202\\n(1893) (citing Rev. Stat. §5399; emphasis added); see post,\\nat 9. But Congress subsequently deleted the word “there-\\nin,” leaving only a broadly worded prohibition against\\nobstruction of “the due administration of justice.” Act of\\nJune 25, 1948, §1503, 62 Stat. 769–770. Congress then\\nused that same amended formulation when it enacted\\n§7212, prohibiting the “obstruction of the due administra-\\ntion” of the Tax Code. Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 68A\\nStat. 855. Given this similarity, it is helpful to consider\\nhow we have interpreted §1503 and other obstruction\\nstatutes in considering §7212. The language of some and\\nthe underlying principles of all these cases are similar.\\nWe consequently find these precedents—though not con-\\ntrolling—highly instructive for use as a guide toward a\\nproper resolution of the issue now before us. See Smith v.\\nCity of Jackson, 544 U. S. 228, 233 (2005).\\n   We conclude that, to secure a conviction under the\\nOmnibus Clause, the Government must show (among\\nother things) that there is a “nexus” between the defend-\\nant’s conduct and a particular administrative proceeding,\\nsuch as an investigation, an audit, or other targeted ad-\\nministrative action. That nexus requires a “relationship\\nin time, causation, or logic with the [administrative] pro-\\nceeding.” Aguilar, 515 U. S., at 599 (citing Wood, 6 F. 3d,\\nat 696). By “particular administrative proceeding” we do\\nnot mean every act carried out by IRS employees in the\\ncourse of their “continuous, ubiquitous, and universally\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 584 U.

While we need not here exhaustively itemize the\\ntypes of administrative conduct that fall within the scope\\nof the statute, that conduct does not include routine, day-\\nto-day work carried out in the ordinary course by the IRS,\\nsuch as the review of tax returns. The Government con-\\ntends the processing of tax returns is part of the admin-\\nistration of the Internal Revenue Code and any corrupt\\neffort to interfere with that task can therefore serve as the\\nbasis of an obstruction conviction. But the same could\\nhave been said of the defendant’s effort to mislead the\\ninvestigating agent in Aguilar. The agent’s investigation\\nwas, at least in some broad sense, a part of the admin-\\nistration of justice. But we nevertheless held the defend-\\nant’s conduct did not support an obstruction charge. 515\\nU. S., at 600. In light of our decision in Aguilar, we find it\\nappropriate to construe §7212’s Omnibus Clause more\\nnarrowly than the Government proposes. Just because a\\ntaxpayer knows that the IRS will review her tax return\\nevery year does not transform every violation of the Tax\\nCode into an obstruction charge.\\n   In addition to satisfying this nexus requirement, the\\nGovernment must show that the proceeding was pending\\nat the time the defendant engaged in the obstructive\\nconduct or, at the least, was then reasonably foreseeable\\nby the defendant. See Arthur Andersen, 544 U. S., at 703,\\n707–708 (requiring the Government to prove a proceeding\\nwas foreseeable in order to convict a defendant for per-\\nsuading others to shred documents to prevent their “use in\\nan official proceeding”). It is not enough for the Govern-\\nment to claim that the defendant knew the IRS may catch\\non to his unlawful scheme eventually. To use a maritime\\nanalogy, the proceeding must at least be in the offing.\\n   For these reasons, the Second Circuit’s judgment is\\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\\nconsistent with this opinion.\\n                                             It is so ordered.\\n\\x0c12               MARINELLO v.

S. C. §7212(a) of the In-\\nternal Revenue Code (Tax Code) makes it a felony to\\n“corruptly . . . endeavo[r] to obstruct or imped[e] the due\\nadministration of this title.” “[T]his title” refers to Title\\n26, which contains the entire Tax Code and authorizes the\\nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) to calculate, assess, and\\ncollect taxes. I would hold that the Omnibus Clause does\\nwhat it says: forbid corrupt efforts to impede the IRS from\\nperforming any of these activities. The Court, however,\\nreads “this title” to mean “a particular [IRS] proceeding.”\\nAnte, at 10. And that proceeding must be either “pending”\\nor “in the offing.” Ante, at 11. The Court may well prefer\\na statute written that way, but that is not what Congress\\nenacted. I respectfully dissent.\\n                            I\\n  Petitioner Carlo J. Marinello, II, owned and managed a\\ncompany that provided courier services. Marinello, how-\\never, kept almost no records of the company’s earnings or\\nexpenditures. He shredded or discarded most business\\nrecords. He paid his employees in cash and did not give\\nthem tax documents. And he took tens of thousands of\\ndollars from the company each year to pay his personal\\n\\x0c2              MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                    THOMAS, J., dissenting\\n\\nexpenses.\\n   Unbeknownst to Marinello, the IRS began investigating\\nhim in 2004. The IRS learned that he had not filed a tax\\nreturn—corporate or individual—since at least 1992. But\\nthe investigation came to a standstill because the IRS did\\nnot have enough information about Marinello’s earnings.\\nThis was not surprising given his diligent efforts to avoid\\ncreating a paper trail. After the investigation ended,\\nMarinello consulted a lawyer and an accountant, both of\\nwhom advised him that he needed to file tax returns and\\nkeep business records. Despite these warnings, Marinello\\ndid neither for another four years.\\n   In 2009, the IRS decided to investigate Marinello again.\\nIn an interview with an IRS agent, Marinello initially\\nclaimed he was exempt from filing tax returns because he\\nmade less than $1,000 per year. Upon further question-\\ning, however, Marinello changed his story. He admitted\\nthat he earned more than $1,000 per year, but said he\\n“ ‘never got around’ ” to paying taxes. 839 F. 3d 209, 212\\n(CA2 2016). He also admitted that he shredded docu-\\nments, did not keep track of the company’s income or\\nexpenses, and used the company’s income for personal\\nbills. His only excuse was that he “took the easy way out.”\\nIbid. After just a few hours of deliberation, a jury con-\\nvicted Marinello of corruptly endeavoring to obstruct or\\nimpede the due administration of the Tax Code, §7212(a).\\n                             II\\n    Section 7212(a)’s Omnibus Clause prohibits “corruptly\\n. . . obstruct[ing] or imped[ing], or endeavor[ing] to ob-\\nstruct or impede, the due administration of this title.” I\\nagree with the Court’s interpretations of “obstruct or\\nimpede” and “due administration,” which together refer to\\nconduct that hinders the IRS’ performance of its official\\nduties. See ante, at 4–5. I also agree that the object of\\nthese words—the thing a person is prohibited from ob-\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)            3\\n\\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\\n\\nstructing the due administration of—is “this title,” i.e.,\\nTitle 26, which contains the entire Tax Code. See ante, at\\n4. But I part ways when the Court concludes that the\\nwhole phrase “due administration of the Tax Code” means\\n“only some of ” the Tax Code—specifically “particular [IRS]\\nproceeding[s], such as an investigation, an audit, or other\\ntargeted administrative action.” Ante, at 5, 10. That\\nlimitation has no basis in the text. In my view, the plain\\ntext of the Omnibus Clause prohibits obstructing the due\\nadministration of the Tax Code in its entirety, not just\\nparticular IRS proceedings.\\n                                A\\n   The words “this title” cannot be read to mean “only some\\nof this title.” As this Court recently reiterated, phrases\\nsuch as “this title” most naturally refer to the cited provi-\\nsion “as a whole.” Rubin v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 583\\nU. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 8). Congress used “this\\ntitle” throughout Title 26 to refer to the Tax Code in its\\nentirety. See, e.g., §7201 (“[a]ny person who willfully\\nattempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax im-\\nposed by this title”); §7203 (“[a]ny person required under\\nthis title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by\\nthis title . . . to make a return, keep any records, or supply\\nany information, who willfully fails to [do so]”). And,\\n“[w]hen Congress wanted to refer only to a particular\\nsubsection or paragraph, it said so.” NLRB v. SW General,\\nInc., 580 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 9); see, e.g.,\\n§7204 (criminalizing willfully failing to furnish a state-\\nment “required under section 6051”); §7207 (criminalizing\\nwillfully furnishing fraudulent or materially false infor-\\nmation “required pursuant to section 6047(b), section\\n6104(d), or subsection (i) or (j) of section 527”); §7210\\n(criminalizing neglecting to appear or produce documents\\n“required under section 6420(e)(2), 6421(g)(2), 6427( j)(2),\\n7602, 7603, and 7604(b)”). Thus, “this title” must refer to\\n\\x0c4               MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\\n\\nthe Tax Code as a whole.\\n   The phrase “due administration of this title” likewise\\nrefers to the due administration of the entire Tax Code.\\nAs this Court has recognized, “administration” of the Tax\\nCode includes four basic steps: information gathering,\\nassessment, levy, and collection. See Direct Marketing\\nAssn. v. Brohl, 575 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2015) (slip op., at 6–\\n7). The first “phase of tax administration procedure” is\\n“information gathering.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6); see,\\ne.g., §§6001–6096. “This step includes private reporting of\\ninformation used to determine tax liability, including\\nreports by third parties who do not owe the tax.” Id., at\\n___ (slip op., at 6) (citation omitted). The “next step in the\\nprocess” is “assessment,” which includes “the process by\\nwhich [a taxpayer’s liability] is calculated” and the “official\\nrecording of a taxpayer’s liability.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at\\n6); see, e.g., §§6201–6241. After information gathering\\nand assessment come “levy” and “collection.” See id., at\\n___ (slip op., at 7); see, e.g., §§6301–6344. Levy refers to “a\\nspecific mode of collection under which the Secretary of\\nthe Treasury distrains and seizes a recalcitrant taxpayer’s\\nproperty.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 7). Collection refers to\\n“the act of obtaining payment of taxes due.” Ibid.\\n   Subtitle F of the Tax Code—titled “Procedure and Ad-\\nministration”—contains directives related to each of these\\nsteps. It requires taxpayers to keep certain records and\\nfile certain returns, §6001; specifies that taxpayers with\\nqualifying incomes must file returns, §6012; and author-\\nizes the Secretary of the Treasury to create returns for\\ntaxpayers who fail to file returns or who file fraudulent\\nones, §6020. It requires the Secretary to make inquiries,\\ndeterminations, and assessments of tax liabilities. §6201.\\nAnd it authorizes the Secretary to collect and levy taxes.\\n§§6301, 6331.

It is not limited to only a few specific provi-\\nsions within the Tax Code.\\n                              B\\n   The Court rejects this straightforward reading, describ-\\ning the “literal language” of the Omnibus Clause as “neu-\\ntral.” Ante, at 4. It concludes that the statute prohibits\\nonly acts related to a pending or imminent proceeding.\\nAnte, at 10–11. There is no textual or contextual support\\nfor this limitation.\\n   The text of the Omnibus Clause is not “neutral”; it omits\\nthe limitation that the Court reads into it. The Omnibus\\nClause nowhere suggests that “only some of ” the processes\\nin the Tax Code are covered, ante, at 5, or that the line\\nbetween covered and uncovered processes is drawn at\\nsome vague notion of “proceeding.” The Omnibus Clause\\ndoes not use the word “proceeding” at all, but instead\\nrefers to the entire Tax Code, which covers much more\\nthan that. This Court cannot “lightly assume that Con-\\ngress has omitted from its adopted text requirements that\\nit nonetheless intends to apply.” Jama v. Immigration\\nand Customs Enforcement, 543 U. S. 335, 341 (2005).\\n   Having failed to find its proposed limit in the text, the\\nCourt turns to context. However, its two contextual ar-\\nguments fare no better.\\n   First, the Court contends that the Omnibus Clause must\\nbe limited to pending or imminent proceedings because\\nthe other clauses of §7212 are limited to actions “taken\\nagainst individual identifiable persons or property.” Ante,\\nat 5. But specific clauses in a statute typically do not limit\\nthe scope of a general omnibus clause. See Ali v. Federal\\nBureau of Prisons, 552 U. S. 214, 225 (2008) (explaining\\n\\x0c6              MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\\n\\nthat the ejusdem generis canon does not apply to a “dis-\\njunctive” phrase in a statute “with one specific and one\\ngeneral category”). Nor do the other clauses in §7212\\ncontain the pending-or-imminent-proceeding requirement\\nthat the Court reads into the Omnibus Clause. See\\n§7212(a) (prohibiting efforts to “intimidate or impede any\\nofficer or employee of the United States acting in an offi-\\ncial capacity”); §7212(b) (prohibiting “forcibly rescu[ing] or\\ncaus[ing] to be rescued any property after it shall have\\nbeen seized under this title”). They thus provide no sup-\\nport for the Court’s atextual limitation.\\n  Second, the Court asserts that its reading prevents the\\nOmnibus Clause from overlapping with certain misde-\\nmeanors in the Tax Code. Ante, at 6–7 (discussing §§7203,\\n7204, 7205). But there is no redundancy problem because\\nthese provisions have different mens rea requirements.\\nThe Omnibus Clause requires that an act be done “cor-\\nruptly,” but the misdemeanor provisions require that an\\nact be done “willfully.” The difference between these mens\\nrea requirements is significant. While “willfully” requires\\nproof only “that the law imposed a duty on the defendant,\\nthat the defendant knew of this duty, and that he volun-\\ntarily and intentionally violated that duty,” Cheek v. United\\nStates, 498 U. S. 192, 201 (1991), “corruptly” requires\\nproof that the defendant “act[ed] with an intent to procure\\nan unlawful benefit either for [himself] or for some other\\nperson,” United States v. Floyd, 740 F. 3d 22, 31 (CA1\\n2014) (collecting cases); see also Black’s Law Dictionary\\n414 (rev. 4th ed. 1951) (“corruptly” “generally imports a\\nwrongful design to acquire some pecuniary or other ad-\\nvantage”). In other words, “corruptly” requires proof that\\nthe defendant not only knew he was obtaining an “unlaw-\\nful benefit” but that his “objective” or “purpose” was to\\nobtain that unlawful benefit. See 21 Am. Jur. 2d, Crimi-\\nnal Law §114 (2016) (explaining that specific intent re-\\nquires both knowledge and purpose).\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 584 U. S. ____ (2018)            7\\n\\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\\n\\n   The Court dismisses the significance of the different\\nmens rea requirements, see ante, at 8, but this difference\\nis important under basic principles of criminal law. The\\nlaw recognizes that the same conduct, when committed\\nwith a higher mens rea, is more culpable and thus more\\ndeserving of punishment. See Schad v. Arizona, 501 U. S.\\n624, 643 (1991) (plurality opinion). For that reason, dif-\\nferent mens rea requirements often differentiate culpabil-\\nity for the same conduct. See, e.g., 40 C. J. S., Homicide\\n§80 (2014) (explaining that the distinction between first-\\nand second-degree murder is based on the defendant’s\\nstate of mind); §103 (same for voluntary and involuntary\\nmanslaughter). Unless the Court means to cast doubt on\\nthis well-established principle, it should not casually\\ndismiss the different mens rea requirements in the Omni-\\nbus Clause and the various misdemeanors in the Tax\\nCode.\\n   Even if the Omnibus Clause did overlap with these\\nother misdemeanors, that would prove little. For better or\\nworse, redundancy abounds in both the criminal law and\\nthe Tax Code. This Court has repeatedly declined to\\ndepart from the plain meaning of the text simply because\\nthe same conduct would be criminalized under two or\\nmore provisions. See, e.g., Loughrin v. United States, 573\\nU. S. ___, ___, n. 4 (2014) (slip op., at 7, n. 4) (“No doubt,\\nthe overlap between the two clauses is substantial on our\\nreading, but that is not uncommon in criminal statutes”);\\nHubbard v. United States, 514 U. S. 695, 714, n. 14 (1995)\\n(“Congress may, and often does, enact separate criminal\\nstatutes that may, in practice, cover some of the same\\nconduct”); Sansone v. United States, 380 U. S. 343, 352\\n(1965) (allowing the Government to proceed on a felony\\ntax evasion charge even though that charge “ ‘covered\\nprecisely the same ground’ ” as two misdemeanors in the\\nTax Code). In fact, the Court’s interpretation of the Om-\\nnibus Clause does not eliminate the redundancy. Certain\\n\\x0c8                  MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                          THOMAS, J., dissenting\\n\\nmisdemeanor offenses in the Tax Code—such as failing to\\nobey a summons, §7210—apply to conduct that takes place\\nduring a proceeding and, thus, would still violate the\\nOmnibus Clause under the Court’s interpretation. The\\nCourt’s interpretation also makes the Omnibus Clause\\nlargely redundant with 18 U. S. C. §1505, which already\\nprohibits “corruptly . . . endeavor[ing] to influence, ob-\\nstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the\\nlaw under which any pending proceeding is being had\\nbefore any department or agency of the United States.”\\nAvoiding redundancy is thus not a reason to favor the\\nCourt’s interpretation. Cf. Marx v. General Revenue Corp.,\\n568 U. S. 371, 385 (2013) (“[T]he canon against surplusage\\n‘assists only where a competing interpretation gives effect\\nto every clause and word of a statute’ ”).*\\n                               C\\n  The Court contends that its narrow reading of “due\\nadministration of this title” is supported by three decisions\\ninterpreting other obstruction statutes, though it admits\\nthat the “language and history” of the Omnibus Clause\\n“differ somewhat” from those other obstruction provisions.\\nAnte, at 9 (citing United States v.

Even assuming legislative history could impose\\na requirement that does not appear in the text, the Court cites nothing\\nin the legislative history that limits the Omnibus Clause to proceed-\\nings—or even uses the word “proceeding.” In fact, the legislative\\nhistory does not say anything at all about the Omnibus Clause. As\\nMarinello concedes, the vague snippets of legislative history that the\\nCourt cites are discussing a different portion of 26 U. S. C. §7212(a),\\ninvolving threats against IRS officers and their family members. See\\nReply Brief 11 (“The conceded focus of §7212(a)’s legislative history was\\nthe officers clause” and it was “relative[ly] silen[t] regarding [the\\nOmnibus Clause]”).\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 584 U.

The differences between the Omnibus Clause\\nand those other obstruction statutes demonstrate why\\nthe former does not contain the Court’s proceeding\\nrequirement.\\n   Aguilar interpreted 18 U. S. C. §1503. The omnibus\\nclause of §1503 forbids corruptly endeavoring to obstruct\\n“the due administration of justice.” The Court concluded\\nthat this language requires the prosecution to prove a\\n“nexus” between the defendant’s obstructive act and “judi-\\ncial proceedings.” 515 U. S., at 599–600. But this nexus\\nrequirement was based on the specific history of §1503.\\nThe predecessor to that statute prohibited obstructing “the\\ndue administration of justice” “in any court of the United\\nStates.” Pettibone v. United States, 148 U. S. 197, 202\\n(1893) (citing Rev. Stat. §5399). Based on this statutory\\nhistory, the Court assumed that §1503 continued to refer\\nto the administration of justice in a court. Aguilar, supra,\\nat 599. None of that history is present here.\\n   Arthur Anderson is even further afield. There the Court\\ninterpreted 18 U. S. C. §1512(b)(2)(A), which prohibits\\n“knowingly . . . corruptly persuad[ing] another person . . .\\nwith intent to . . . cause or induce [that] person to . . .\\nwithhold testimony, or withhold a record, document, or\\nother object, from an official proceeding.” Relying on\\nAguilar, the Court concluded that §1512(b)(2)(A) required\\nthe Government to show a “nexus” with “[a] particular\\nproceeding.” 544 U. S., at 707–708. But this nexus re-\\nquirement came from the statutory text, which expressly\\nincluded “an official proceeding.”      If anything, then,\\n§1512(b)(2)(A) cuts against the Court’s interpretation of\\nthe Omnibus Clause because it shows that Congress\\nknows how to impose a “proceeding” requirement when it\\nwants to do so. See Kucana v. Holder, 558 U. S. 233, 248\\n(2010); Jama, 543 U. S., at 341.\\n   Yates underscores this point. There the Court inter-\\n\\x0c10             MARINELLO v. UNITED STATES\\n\\n                     THOMAS, J., dissenting\\n\\npreted 18 U. S. C. §1519, which prohibits obstructing “the\\ninvestigation or proper administration of any matter\\nwithin the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the\\nUnited States.” The four Justices in the plurality recog-\\nnized that this language made §1519 broader than other\\nobstruction statutes: Section 1519 “covers conduct intended\\nto impede any federal investigation or proceeding, includ-\\ning one not even on the verge of commencement.” 574\\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 18). The plurality contrasted the\\nterm “official proceeding” with the phrase “investigation or\\nproper administration of any matter within the jurisdic-\\ntion of any department or agency,” noting that the latter is\\nbroader. Id., at ___–___ (slip op., at 12–13). The same is\\ntrue for the broad language of the Omnibus Clause.\\n   In sum, these cases demonstrate that, when text and\\nhistory justify it, this Court interprets obstruction statutes\\nto include a proceeding requirement. But we have never\\ninserted such a requirement into an obstruction statute\\nwithout textual or historical support. Today the Court\\ndoes precisely that.\\n                               D\\n  All else having failed, the Court invokes lenity-sounding\\nconcerns to justify reading its proceeding requirement into\\nthe Omnibus Clause. See ante, at 4, 7. But the rule of\\nlenity applies only if after applying ordinary tools of statu-\\ntory interpretation, “there remains a grievous ambiguity\\nor uncertainty in the statute such that the Court must\\nsimply guess as to what Congress intended.” Barber v.\\nThomas, 560 U. S. 474, 488 (2010) (citation and internal\\nquotation marks omitted). The Court identifies no such\\ngrievous ambiguity in the Omnibus Clause, and breadth is\\nnot the same thing as ambiguity. The Omnibus Clause is\\nboth “very broad” and “very clear.” Yates, supra, at ___\\n(KAGAN, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 15). Lenity does not\\napply.\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 584 U.

The Court outlines its atextual\\nproceeding requirement in only the vaguest of terms.\\nUnder its interpretation, the prosecution must prove a\\n“nexus” between the defendant’s conduct and some “par-\\nticular administrative proceeding.”             Ante, at 10.\\n“[P]articular administrative proceeding” is defined nega-\\ntively as “not . . . every act carried out by IRS employees in\\nthe course of their ‘continuous, ubiquitous, and universally\\nknown’ administration of the Tax Code.” Ante, at 10–11.\\nFurther, the Government must prove that the proceeding\\nwas “reasonably foreseeable” to the defendant. Ante, at\\n11. “Reasonably foreseeable” is again defined negatively\\nas “not . . . that the defendant knew the IRS may catch\\nonto his unlawful scheme eventually.” Ibid. It is hard to\\nsee how the Court’s statute is less vague than the one\\nCongress drafted, which simply instructed individuals not\\nto corruptly obstruct or impede the IRS’ administration of\\nthe Tax Code.\\n                               E\\n    To be sure, §7212(a) is a sweeping obstruction statute.\\nCongress may well have concluded that a broad statute\\nwas warranted because “our tax structure is based on a\\nsystem of self-reporting” and “the Government depends\\nupon the good faith and integrity of each potential tax-\\npayer to disclose honestly all information relevant to tax\\nliability.” United States v. Bisceglia, 420 U. S. 141, 145\\n(1975). Whether or not we agree with Congress’ judgment,\\nwe must leave the ultimate “[r]esolution of the pros and\\ncons of whether a statute should sweep broadly or narrowly\\n. . . for Congress.” United States v.

Whether the Omnibus Clause would\\ncover these hypotheticals—and whether the Government\\nwould waste its resources identifying and prosecuting\\nthem—is debatable. But what should not be debatable is\\nthat the statute covers Marinello, who systematically\\nshredded documents and hid evidence about his company’s\\nearnings to avoid paying taxes even after warnings from\\nhis lawyer and accountant. It is not hard to find similar\\ncases prosecuted under the Omnibus Clause. See, e.g.,\\nUnited States v.

Brown, of Guthrie, Okl., for petitioner.\\nThe Attorney General and Mr. Claude R. Branch, of Providence, R. I., for the United States.\\nMr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n\\n\\n1\\nThe petitioner was convicted of transporting from Ottawa, Illinois, to Guymon, Oklahoma, an airplane that he knew to have been stolen, and was sentenced to serve three years' imprisonment and to pay a fine of $2,000. The judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 43 F.(2d) 273. A writ of certiorari was granted by this Court on the question whether the National Motor Vehicle Theft Act applies to aircraft. Act of October 29, 1919, c. 89, 41 Stat. 324, U. S. Code, title 18, § 408 (18 USCA § 408). That Act provides: 'Sec. 2. That when used in this Act: (a) The term 'motor vehicle' shall include an automobile, automobile truck, automobile wagon, motor cycle, or any other self-propelled vehicle not designed for running on rails. * * * Sec. 3. That whoever shall transport or cause to be transported in interstate or foreign commerce a motor vehicle, knowing the same to have been stolen, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $5,000, or by imprisonment of not more than five years, or both.'\\n\\n\\n2\\nSection 2 defines the motor vehicles of which the transportation in interstate commerce is punished in Section 3. The question is the meaning of the word 'vehicle' in the phrase 'any other self-propelled vehicle not designed for running on rails.' No doubt etymologically it is possible to use the word to signify a conveyance working on land, water or air, and sometimes legislation extends the use in that direction, e. g., land and air, water being separately provided for, in the Tariff Act, September 21, 1922, c. 356, § 401(b), 42 Stat. 858, 948 (19 USCA § 231(b). But in everyday speech 'vehicle' calls up the picture of a thing moving on land. Thus in Rev. St. § 4 (1 USCA § 4) intended, the Government suggests, rather to enlarge than to restrict the definition, vehicle includes every contrivance capable of being used 'as a means of transportation on land.' And this is repeated, expressly excluding aircraft, in the Tariff Act, June 17, 1930, c. 497, § 401(b), 46 Stat. 590, 708 (19 USCA § 1401). So here, the phrase under discussion calls up the popular picture. For after including automobile truck, automobile wagon and motor cycle, the words 'any other self-propelled vehicle not designed for running on rails' still indicate that a vehicle in the popular sense, that is a vehicle running on land is the theme. It is a vehicle that runs, not something, not commonly called a vehicle, that flies. Airplanes were well known in 1919 when this statute was passed, but it is admitted that they were not mentioned in the reports or in the debates in Congress. It is impossible to read words that so carefully enumerate the different forms of motor vehicles and have no reference of any kind to aircraft, as including airplanes under a term that usage more and more precisely confines to a different class. The counsel for the petitioner have shown that the phraseology of the statute as to motor vehicles follows that of earlier statutes of Connecticut, Delaware, Ohio, Michigan and Missouri, not to mention the late Regulations of Traffic for the District of Columbia, title 6, c. 9, § 242, none of which can be supposed to leave the earth.\\n\\n\\n3\\nAlthough it is not likely that a criminal will carefully consider the text of the law before he murders or steals, it is reasonable that a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed. To make the warning fair, so far as possible the line should be clear. When a rule of conduct is laid down in words that evoke in the common mind only the pleture of vehicles moving on land, the statute should not be extended to aircraft simply because it may seem to us that a similar policy applies, or upon the speculation that if the legislature had thought of it, very likely the picture of vehicles moving on land, the United States v.

Because the combined weight of the blotter paper and LSD actually sold by Neal was 109.51 grams, the court ruled, among other things, that he was subject to 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(v), which imposes a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence on anyone convicted of trafficking in more than 10 grams of \"a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount\" of LSD. After the Commission revised the Guidelines\\' calculation method by instructing courts to give each dose of LSD on a carrier medium a constructive or presumed weight, Neal filed a motion to modify his sentence, contending that the weight of the LSD attributable to him under the amended Guidelines was only 4.58 grams, well short of § 841(b)(1)(A)(v)\\'s 10-gram requirement, and that the Guidelines\\' presumptive-weight method controlled the mandatory minimum calculation.  The District Court followed Chapman v. United States, 500 U.S. 453, 468, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 1929, 114 L.Ed.2d 524, in holding, inter alia, that the actual weight of the blotter paper, with its absorbed LSD, was determinative of whether Neal crossed the 10-gram threshold and that the 10-year mandatory minimum sentence still applied to him notwithstanding the Guidelines.  In affirming, the en banc Seventh Circuit agreed with the District Court that a dual system now prevails in calculating LSD weights in cases like this.\\nHeld:  Section 841(b)(1) directs a sentencing court to take into account the actual weight of the blotter paper with its absorbed LSD, even though the Sentencing Guidelines require a different method of calculating the weight of an LSD mixture or substance.  The Court rejects petitioner\\'s contentions that the revised Guidelines are entitled to deference as a construction of § 841(b)(1) and that those Guidelines require reconsideration of the method used to determine statutory minimum sentences.  While the Commission\\'s expertise and the Guidelines\\' design may be of potential weight and relevance in other contexts, the Commission\\'s choice of an alternative methodology for weighing LSD does not alter Chapman\\'s interpretation of the statute.  In any event, stare decisis requires that the Court adhere to Chapman in the absence of intervening statutory changes casting doubt on the case\\'s interpretation.  It is doubtful that the Commission intended the Guidelines to displace Chapman\\'s actual- weight method for statutory minimum sentences, since the Commission\\'s authoritative Guidelines commentary indicates that the new method is not an interpretation of the statute, but an independent calculation, and suggests that the statute controls if it conflicts with the Guidelines.  Moreover, the Commission\\'s dose-based method cannot be squared with Chapman.  In these circumstances, this Court need not decide what, if any, deference is owed the Commission in order to reject its contrary interpretation.  Once the Court has determined a statute\\'s meaning, it adheres to its ruling under stare decisis and assesses an agency\\'s later interpretation of the statute against that settled law.  It is the responsibility of Congress, not this Court, to change statutes that are thought to be unwise or unfair.

Wolfson, Washington, DC, for respondent.\\nJustice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n\\n\\n1\\nThe policy of sentencing drug offenders based on the amount of drugs involved, straightforward enough in its simplest formulation, gives rise to complexities, requiring us again to address the methods for calculating the weight of LSD sold by a drug trafficker.  We reject petitioner\\'s contention that the revised system for determining LSD amounts under the United States Sentencing Guidelines requires reconsideration of the method used to determine statutory minimum sentences, and we adhere to our former decision on the subject.\\n\\n\\n2\\n* LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) is such a powerful narcotic that the average dose contains only 0.05 milligrams of the pure drug.  The per-dose amount is so minute that in most instances LSD is transferred to a carrier medium and sold at retail by the dose, not by weight.  In the typical case, pure LSD is dissolved in alcohol or other solvent, and the resulting solution is applied to paper or gelatin.  The solvent evaporates;  the LSD remains.  The dealer cuts the paper or gel into single-dose squares for sale on the street.  Users ingest the LSD by swallowing or licking the squares or drinking a beverage into which the squares have been mixed.\\n\\n\\n3\\nIn 1988, petitioner Meirl Neal was arrested for selling 11,456 doses of LSD on blotter paper.  The combined weight of the LSD and the paper was 109.51 grams.  Following a guilty plea in the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois, petitioner was convicted of one count of possession of LSD with intent to distribute it, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841, and one count of conspiracy to possess LSD with intent to distribute it, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846.  At the initial sentencing, the method for determining the weight of the illegal mixture or substance was the same under the Guidelines and the statute directing minimum sentences.  The determinative amount was the whole weight of the blotter paper containing the drug.  See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual § 2D1.1, Drug Quantity Table, n. * (Nov.1987) (1987 USSG).  Because the total weight of the LSD and blotter paper exceeded 10 grams, the District Court found petitioner subject to the 10-year mandatory minimum sentence specified in 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(v).  Under the version of the Sentencing Guidelines then in effect, the indicated sentence was even greater than the statutory minimum: the quantity of the drugs and petitioner\\'s prior convictions resulted in a Guidelines sentencing range of 188 to 235 months\\' imprisonment, even after an adjustment for petitioner\\'s acceptance of responsibility for the crime.  The District Court imposed concurrent sentences of 192 months imprisonment on each count, to be followed by five years of supervised release.\\n\\n\\n4\\nIn November 1993, the United States Sentencing Commission revised the method of calculating the weight of LSD in the Sentencing Guidelines.  United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines  Manual, App. C., Amend.  488 (Nov.1995) (1995 USSG). Departing from its former approach of weighing the entire mixture or substance containing LSD, the amended Guideline instructed courts to give each dose of LSD on a carrier medium a constructive or presumed weight of 0.4 milligrams.  Id., § 2D1.1(c), n. * (H). The revised Guideline was retroactive, id., App. C., Amend. 502, and one month later petitioner filed a motion to modify his sentence, see 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2).  He contended that the weight of the LSD attributable to him under the amended Guidelines was 4.58 grams (11,456 doses x 0.4 milligrams).  For that amount, the applicable sentencing range under the Guidelines would be 70 to 87 months of imprisonment.  The 10-year statutory minimum of § 841(b)(1)(A)(v) was no bar to a reduced sentence, petitioner argued, because the presumptive-weight method of the Guidelines should also control the mandatory minimum calculation.  The 4.58 grams attributable to him by the Guideline method would be well short of the 10 grams necessitating a 10-year minimum sentence.\\n\\n\\n5\\nThe District Court, following our recent decision in Chapman v. United States, 500 U.S. 453, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991), ruled that the blotter paper must be weighed in determining whether petitioner crossed the 10-gram threshold of § 841(b)(1)(A)(v).  It held that the mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years still applied to petitioner notwithstanding the sentencing range under the Guidelines.  Since the Guidelines no longer authorized a sentence above the statutory minimum, the District Court reduced petitioner\\'s sentence to 120 months on each count.\\n\\n\\n6\\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, sitting en banc, agreed with the District Court that a dual system now prevails in calculating LSD weights in cases like this, and it affirmed petitioner\\'s sentence.\\n\\n\\n7\\nWe granted certiorari to resolve a conflict in the Courts of Appeals over whether the revised Guideline governs the calculation of the weight of LSD for purposes of § 841(b)(1).  515 U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 2576, 132 L.Ed.2d 826 (1995).

Under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Pub.L. 91-513, 84 Stat. 1236, penalties depended upon whether or not a drug was classified as a narcotic.  Chagrined by the resulting sentencing disparities, Congress amended the narcotics laws in 1984 to calculate penalties by the weight of the pure drug involved.  See Chapman, supra, at 460-461, 111 S.Ct. at 1925.  Focusing on the pure drug, however, often allowed retail traffickers, who supplied street markets with mixed or diluted drugs ready for consumption, to receive sentences lighter than what Congress deemed necessary.  Id., at 461, 111 S.Ct. at 1925.  In passing the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Pub.L. 99-570, 100 Stat. 3207, \"Congress adopted a \\'market-oriented\\' approach to punishing drug trafficking, under which the total quantity of what is distributed, rather than the amount of pure drug involved, is used to determine the length of the sentence.\" Chapman, supra, at 461, 111 S.Ct. at 1925;  H.R.Rep. No. 99-845, pt. 1, pp. 11-12, 17 (19 86).  The Act provided for mandatory minimum sentences based on the weight of \"a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount\" of various controlled substances, including LSD. 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(b)(1)(A)(i)-(viii) and (B)(i)-(viii).  Trafficking in 10 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing LSD earns the offender at least 10 years in prison. § 841(b)(1)(A)(v).\\n\\n\\n9\\nIn Chapman, we interpreted the provision of the Act that provided a mandatory minimum sentence of five years for trafficking in an LSD \"mixture or substance\" that weighed one gram or more, see § 841(b)(1)(B)(v).  We construed \"mixture\" and \"substance\" to have their ordinary meaning, observing that the terms had not been defined in the statute or the Sentencing Guidelines and had no distinctive common law meaning.  500 U.S., at 461-462, 111 S.Ct. at 1925-1926.  Reasoning that the \"LSD is diffused among the fibers of the paper . . . and cannot be distinguished from the blotter paper, nor easily separated from it,\" id., at 462, 111 S.Ct. at 1926, we held that the actual weight of the blotter paper, with its absorbed LSD, is determinative under the statute, id., at 468, 111 S.Ct. at 1929.\\n\\n\\n10\\nPetitioner contends that the method approved in Chapman is no longer appropriate.  In his view, the Commission intended its dose-based method to supplant the actual-weight method used in Chapman, and we should not presume that the Commission would recognize two inconsistent schemes for sentencing LSD traffickers, cf.  1995 USSG § 2D1.1, comment., backg\\'d. (stating purposes of making offense levels in § 2D1.1 \"proportional to the levels established by statute\" and providing \"a logical sentencing structure for drug offenses\").  Petitioner concedes, as he must, that the Commission does not have the authority to amend the statute we construed in Chapman.  He argues, nonetheless, that the Commission is the agency charged with interpretation of penalty statutes and expert in sentencing matters, so its construction of § 841(b)(1) should be given deference.  See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).  Congress intended the Commission\\'s rulemaking to respond to judicial decisions in developing a coherent sentencing regime, see Braxton v. United States, 500 U.S. 344, 348, 111 S.Ct. 1854, 1857-1858, 114 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991), so, petitioner contends, deference is appropriate even though the Commission\\'s interpretation postdated Chapman.  In the alternative, he urges that we reassess Chapman in light of the Commission\\'s revised method, which was formed from careful study of retail drug markets.  Although Chapman established that the weight of the blotter paper must be taken into account, it did not address how courts should do so.  The Commission has filled the gap, petitioner maintains, by assigning a constructive weight to the LSD and carrier for each dose.\\n\\n\\n11\\nWhile acknowledging that the Commission\\'s expertise and the design of the Guidelines may be of potential weight and relevance in other contexts, we conclude that the Commission\\'s choice of an alternative methodology for weighing LSD does not alter our interpretation of the statute in Chapman.  In any event, principles of stare decisis require that we adhere to our earlier decision.\\n\\n\\n12\\nThe Commission was born of congressional disenchantment with the vagaries of federal sentencing and of the parole system. Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 366, 109 S.Ct. 647, 651-652, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989) (discussing the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 and its legislative history).  The Commission is directed to \"establish sentencing policies and practices for the Federal criminal justice system\" that meet congressional goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2) and that, within a regime of individualized sentencing, eliminate unwarranted disparities in punishment of similar defendants who commit similar crimes.  See 28 U.S.C. §§ 991(b)(1)(A)-(B).  Congress also c harged the Commission with the duty to measure and monitor the effectiveness of various sentencing, penal, and correctional practices. § 991(b)(2).  In fulfilling its mandate, the Commission has the authority to promulgate, review, and revise binding guidelines to \"establish a range of determinate sentences for categories of offenses and defendants according to various specified factors, among others.\"   Mistretta, 488 U.S., at 368, 109 S.Ct., at 653 (internal quotation marks omitted);  see 28 U.S.C. §§ 994(a), (b), (c), and (o).\\n\\n\\n13\\nLike 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1), the Sentencing Guidelines calibrate the punishment of drug traffickers according to the quantity of drugs involved in the offense.  From their inception in 1987, the Guidelines have used a detailed Drug Quantity Table as a first step in determining the sentence.  See 1995 USSG § 2D1.1(c);  1987 USSG § 2D1.1. The current Table has 17 tiers, each with specified weight ranges for different controlled substances. The weight ranges reflect the Commission\\'s assessment of equivalent culpability among defendants who traffic in different types of drugs, and so all defendants in the same tier are assigned the same base offense level.  See 1995 USSG § 2 D1.1(c). Once the base offense level is adjusted for other factors, it yields a specific sentencing range depending on the defendant\\'s criminal history.  See 1995 USSG § 1B1.1.\\n\\n\\n14\\nAlthough the mandatory-minimum statute and the Guidelines both turn upon drug quantities, the Commission itself has noted that \"mandatory minimums are both structurally and functionally at odds with sentencing guidelines and the goals the guidelines seek to achieve.\"  United States Sentencing Commission, Special Report to Congress:  Mandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System 26 (Aug.1991).\\n\\n\\n15\\n\"The sentencing guidelines system is essentially a system of      finely calibrated sentences.  For example, as the quantity of      drugs increases, there is a proportional increase in the      sentence.  In marked contrast, the mandatory minimums are      essentially a flat, tariff-like approach to sentencing.      Whereas guidelines seek a smooth continuum, mandatory      minimums result in \"cliffs.\"  The \"cliffs\" that result from      mandatory minimums compromise proportionality, a fundamental      premise for just punishment, and a primary goal of the      Sentencing Reform Act.\" Id., at iii.\\n\\n\\n16\\nDespite incongruities between the Guidelines and the mandatory sentencing statute, the Commission has sought to make the Guidelines parallel to the scheme of § 841(b)(1) in most instances.  See 1995 USSG § 2D1.1, comment., n. 10 (\"The Commission has used the sentences provided in, and equivalences derived from, the statute (21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)), as the primary basis for the guideline sentences\").  As a general rule, the Commission adopts the same approach to weighing drugs as the statute does:  \"Unless otherwise specified, the weight of a controlled substance set forth in the table refers to the entire weight of any mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of the controlled substance.\"  1995 USSG § 2D1.1(c), n. * (A); see also 1995 USSG § 2D1.1, comment., n. 1 (\" \\'Mixture or substance\\' as used in this guideline has the same meaning as in 21 U.S.C. § 841, except as expressly provided\");  1987 USSG § 2D1.1, n. * (weighing rule intended to be \"[c]onsistent with the provisions of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act\").  For most narcotics, there will be no inconsistency in the calculations of drug quantities.\\n\\n\\n17\\nAfter study of the LSD trade, however, the Commission in 1993 decided it could no longer follow that general rule for LSD offenses and fulfill the statutory directive to promote proportionate sentencing.  The Commission determined that \"[b]ecause the weights of LSD carrier media vary widely and typically far exceed the weight of the controlled substance itself, . . . basing offense levels on the entire weight of the LSD and carrier medium would produce unwarranted disparity among offenses involving the same quantity of actual  LSD (but different carrier weights), as well as sentences disproportionate to those for other, more dangerous controlled substances, such as PCP.\" 1995 USSG § 2 D1.1, comment., backg\\'d.  To remedy the problem, the Commission revised its Guideline to provide:\\n\\n\\n18\\n\"In the case of LSD on a carrier medium (e.g., a sheet of      blotter paper), do not use the weight of the LSD/carrier      medium.  Instead, treat each dose of LSD on the carrier      medium as equal to 0.4 mg of LSD for the purposes of the Drug      Quantity Table.\"  1995 USSG § 2D1.1(c) n. * (H).\\n\\n\\n19\\nUnder the amendment, a court determines the defendant\\'s base offense level in the Drug Quantity Table by multiplying the number of doses of LSD involved by 0.4 milligrams.  The Commission submitted the amendment to Congress, which did not disapprove it in the 180 days allotted by statute.  See 28 U.S.C. § 994(p).  The amended Guideline took effect on November 1, 1993, and was in force when petitioner was resentenced.\\n\\n\\n20\\nAs a threshold matter, it is doubtful that the Commission intended the constructive-weight method of the Guidelines to displace the actual-weight method that Chapman requires for statutory minimum sentences.  The commentary, which is the authoritative construction of the Guideline absent plain inconsistency or statutory or constitutional infirmity, Stinson v. United States, 508 U.S. 36, ----, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1915, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993), states that the new method is to be used \"for purposes of determining the base offense level.\"  1995 USSG § 2D1.1, comment., backg\\'d.  The next paragraph of the commentary repeats the point:  the new method will make \"the offense level for LSD on a carrier medium . . . [less than] that for the same number of doses of PCP,\" \"harmonize offense levels for LSD offenses with those for other controlled substances,\" and \"avoid an undue influence of varied carrier weight on the applicable offense level.\"  Ibid. This would be obscure language to choose if the Commission were attempting an interpretation of the statute as well as a revision of the Guidelines, for offense levels are not relevant to the mandatory-minimum calculation.\\n\\n\\n21\\nFurthermore, after a catalogue of reasons for adopting the dose-based method, the Commission ends with the observation that \"[n]onetheless, this approach does not override the applicability of \\'mixture or substance\\' for the purpose of applying any mandatory minimum sentence (see Chapman;  § 5G1.1(b)).\"   Ibid. The citation of Chapman in tandem with § 5G1.1(b), which advises that \"[w]here a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence,\" suggests that the Guidelines calculation is independent of the statutory calculation, and that the statute controls if they conflict.  The Commission seems to do no more than acknowledge that, whether or not its method would be preferable for the statute and Guideline alike, it has no authority to override the statute as we have construed it.\\n\\n\\n22\\nWere we, for argument\\'s sake, to adopt petitioner\\'s view that the Commission intended the commentary as an interpretation of § 841(b)(1), and that the last sentence of the commentary states the Commission\\'s view that the dose-based method is consistent with the term \"mixture or substance\" in the statute, he still would not prevail.  The Commission\\'s dose-based method cannot be squared with Chapman.  The Guideline does take into account some of the weight of the carrier medium (because the average weight of an LSD dose is 0.05 milligrams, 0.35 of the Commission\\'s constructive weight per dose of 0.4 milligrams is attributable to the medium, see 1995 USSG § 2D1.1, comment., backg\\'d), but we held in Chapman that § 841(b)(1) requires \"the entire mixture or substance . . . to be weighed when calculating the sentence.\"  500 U.S., at 459, 111 S.Ct., at 1924.  In these circumstances, we need not decide what, if any, deference is owed the Commission in order t o reject its alleged contrary interpretation.  Once we have determined a statute\\'s meaning, we adhere to our ruling under the doctrine of stare decisis, and we assess an agency\\'s later interpretation of the statute against that settled law.   Lechmere, Inc. v. NLRB, 502 U.S. 527, 536-537, 112 S.Ct. 841, 847-848, 117 L.Ed.2d 79 (1992);  Maislin Industries, U.S., Inc. v. Primary Steel, Inc., 497 U.S. 116, 131, 110 S.Ct. 2759, 2768, 111 L.Ed.2d 94 (1990).\\n\\n\\n23\\nOur reluctance to overturn precedents derives in part from institutional concerns about the relationship of the judiciary to Congress.  One reason that we give great weight to stare decisis in the area of statutory construction is that \"Congress is free to change this Court\\'s interpretation of its legislation.\"  Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 736, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 2070, 52 L.Ed.2d 707 (1977).  We have overruled our precedents when the intervening development of the law has \"removed or weakened the conceptual underpinnings from the prior decision, or where the later law has rendered the decision irreconcilable with competing legal doctrines or policies.\"   Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 173, 109 S.Ct. 2363, 2370, 105 L.Ed.2d 132 (1989) (citations omitted).  Absent those changes or compelling evidence bearing on Congress\\' original intent, NLRB v. Longshoremen, 473 U.S. 61, 84, 105 S.Ct. 3045, 3058-3059, 87 L.Ed.2d 47 (1985), our system demands that we adhere to our prior interpretations of statutes.  Entrusted within its sphere to make policy judgments, the Commission may abandon its old methods in favor of what it has deemed a more desirable \"approach\" to calculating LSD quantities, cf.  1995 USSG § 2D1.1, comment., backg\\'d.  We, however, do not have the same latitude to forsake prior interpretations of a statute.  True, there may be little in logic to defend the statute\\'s treatment of LSD;  it results in significant disparity of punishment meted out to LSD offenders relative to other narcotics traffickers.  (Although the number of doses petitioner sold seems high, the quantities of other narcotics a defendant would have to sell to receive a comparable sentence under the statute yield far more doses, see United States v. Marshall, 908 F.2d 1312, 1334 (C.A.7 1990) (Posner, J., dissenting), aff\\'d sub. nom.  Chapman v. United States, 500 U.S. 453, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991)).  Even so, Congress, not this Court, has the responsibility for revising its statutes. Were we to alter our statutory interpretations from case to case, Congress would have less reason to exercise its responsibility to correct statutes that are thought to be unwise or unfair.\\n\\n\\n24\\nLike Chapman, this case involves a petitioner who sold LSD on blotter paper, the \"carrier of choice\" involved in \"the vast majority of cases.\"  500 U.S., at 466, 111 S.Ct., at 1928.  Just as we declined in Chapman to entertain \"hypothetical cases . . . involving very heavy carriers and very little LSD\" in resolving a due process challenge, ibid., we do not address how § 841(b)(1) should be applied in those cases.\\n\\n\\n25\\nWe hold that § 841(b)(1) directs a sentencing court to take into account the actual weight of the blotter paper with its absorbed LSD, even though the Sentencing Guidelines require a different method of calculating the weight of an LSD mixture or substance.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\\n\\n\\n26\\n\\nIt is so ordered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*\\n The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.

Under the Probation Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3651, federal judges have long had authority to suspend the execution of certain sentences and to impose probation instead.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that § 3147 \"supersede[d]\" § 3651, leaving federal judges without authority to suspend execution of sentences imposed under § 3147, 794 F.2d 24, 26 (1986).  We reverse.\\n\\n\\n2\\nPetitioner, Gloria Rodriguez, was arrested for selling cocaine.  While released on a personal recognizance bond she was arrested again, for selling heroin.  She pleaded guilty to both charges.  The sentencing judge recognized that § 31471 required that petitioner be sentenced to at least a 2-year term of imprisonment in addition to the sentences for the two drug offenses.  Nevertheless, relying on § 3651,2 he suspended execution of that sentence, finding that under the circumstances a 2-year probation term was more appropriate.  The United States appealed, arguing that § 3147 had superseded § 3651, and that the sentencing judge had no authority to suspend execution of the sentence imposed under § 3147.  The Court of Appeals agreed with the United States and reversed.  794 F.2d 24 (CA2 1986). Rodriguez then filed this petition for certiorari.\\n\\n\\n3\\nSince § 3147 does not explicitly divest sentencing judges of their authority under § 3651, the Court of Appeals\\' judgment amounts to the conclusion that § 3147 is an implicit partial repeal of § 3651.  It is well settled, however, that repeals by implication are not favored, see, e.g., TVA v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 189, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 2299, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978), and will not be found unless an intent to repeal is \" \\'clear and manifest.\\' \" United States v. Borden Co., 308 U.S. 188, 198, 60 S.Ct. 182, 188, 84 L.Ed. 181 (1939) (quoting Red Rock v. Henry, 106 U.S. 596, 602, 1 S.Ct. 434, 439, 27 L.Ed. 251 (1883)).  Nothing in the language of these two provisions suggests the existence of the \" \\' \"irreconcilable conflict,\" \\' \" Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corp., 456 U.S. 461, 468, 102 S.Ct. 1883, 1890, 72 L.Ed.2d 262 (1982) (citations omitted), from which an intent to repeal may be inferred.  To the contrary, the provisions fit together quite sensibly.  Section 3147 requires that those who commit felonies while on release be sentenced to a term of at least two years;  § 3651 authorizes sentencing judges to suspend execution of those sentences if probation would be more appropriate.  Section 3147 is no different from many other federal statutes requiring minimum sentences, which have uniformly been held to be subject to the suspension authority of § 3651.  See, e.g., Andrews v. United States, 373 U.S. 334, 340, 83 S.Ct. 1236, 1239, 10 L.Ed.2d 383 (1963) (dictum);  United States v. Davis, 560 F.2d 144, 148, n. 6 (CA3), cert. denied sub nom. Hazzard v.

United States, 419 F.2d 593, 597-598 (CA8 1969);  United States v. Cameron, 351 F.2d 448, 449 (CA7 1965);  United States v. Hardaway, 350 F.2d 1021, 1022 (CA6 1965);  Smith v. United States, 284 F.2d 789, 791, n. 2 (CA5 1960);  United States v. Donovan, 242 F.2d 61, 64 (CA2 1957).\\n\\n\\n4\\nThe Court of Appeals rested its conclusion in part on the legislative history of the CCCA, noting that various Senate and House Reports referred to § 3147 as establishing a \"mandatory\" sentence, as prescribing a \"term of imprisonment of at least two years and not more than ten,\" and as \"requir[ing] that the individual be imprisoned for an additional period of time.\"  See 794 F.2d, at 26-29.  Even if unrebutted, these passing references would not constitute the \"clear and manifest\" evidence of congressional intent necessary to establish repeal by implication.  In fact, however, the totality of the legislative history of the Act demonstrates with unusual clarity that no repeal was intended.  A Senate Report on an early version of the Act pointed out that statutes specifying minimum sentences did not create mandatory minimum terms of confinement, since such sentences could be suspended in favor of probation or parole. S.Rep. No. 98-225, p. 66, n. 129 (1983), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1984, p. 3182.  The same Report also noted that the reported version of the provision eventually codified at 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) would permit such suspension, and recommended that it be amended to eliminate that possibility.  S.Rep., at 312-313. Congress subsequently did amend § 924(c), as well as certain other provisions of the CCCA, to make § 3651 unambiguously inapplicable. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c), 929(a) (1982 ed., Supp. III);  18 U.S.C.App. § 1202(a);  21 U.S.C. § 845a(c) (1982 ed., Supp. III). \" \\'[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\\' \"  Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S.Ct. 296, 300, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983) (quoting United States v. Wong Kim Bo, 472 F.2d 720, 722 (CA5 1972)).  It is, in short, overwhelmingly clear that, in passing the CCCA, Congress acted—as it is presumed to act, see, e.g., Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 581-582, 98 S.Ct. 866, 870-871, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978)—with full awareness of the well-established judicial interpretation that § 3651 permits the suspension of sentences \"unless [it is] explicitly made inapplicable.\"  United States v. Donovan, supra, at 64.\\n\\n\\n5\\nAdditionally, and most impermissibly, the Court of Appeals relied on its understanding of the broad purposes of the CCCA, which included decreasing the frequency with which persons on pretrial release commit crimes and diminishing the sentencing discretion of judges.  But no legislation pursues its purposes at all costs.  Deciding what competing values will or will not be sacrificed to the achievement of a particular objective is the very essence of legislative choice—and it frustrates rather than effectuates legislative intent simplistically to assume that whatever furthers the statute\\'s primary objective must be the law.  Where, as here, \"the language of a provision . . . is sufficiently clear in its context and not at odds with the legislative history, . . . \\'[there is no occasion] to examine the additional considerations of \"policy\" . . . that may have influenced the lawmakers in their formulation of the statute.\\' \"  Aaron v.

S. C. § 922(g)(1), the Government sought to increase his sentence from a 37-month maximum to the 15-year minimum that § 924(e), popularly known as the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), mandates for such felons who have three prior convictions for violent felonies or drug offenses. Shepard\\'s predicate felonies were Massachusetts burglary convictions entered upon guilty pleas. This Court has held that only \"generic burglary\" — meaning, among other things, that it was committed in a building or enclosed space — is a violent crime under the ACCA, Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, 599, and that a court sentencing under the ACCA can look to statutory elements, charging documents, and jury instructions to determine whether an earlier conviction after a jury trial was for generic burglary in States (like Massachusetts) with broader burglary definitions, id., at 602. Refusing to consider the 15-year minimum, the District Court found that a Taylor investigation did not show that Shepard had three generic burglary convictions and rejected the Government\\'s argument that the court should examine police reports and complaint applications in determining whether Shepard\\'s guilty pleas admitted and supported generic burglary convictions. The First Circuit vacated, ruling that such reports and applications should be considered. On remand, the District Court again declined to impose the enhanced sentence. The First Circuit vacated.\\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\\n348 F. 3d 308, reversed and remanded.\\nJUSTICE SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part III, concluding that enquiry under the ACCA to determine whether a guilty plea to burglary under a nongeneric statute necessarily admitted elements of the generic offense is limited to the terms of the charging document, to the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the defendant confirmed the factual basis for the plea, or to some comparable judicial record of this information. Guilty pleas may establish ACCA predicate offenses, and Taylor\\'s reasoning controls the identification of generic convictions following pleas, as well as convictions on verdicts, in States with nongeneric offenses. The ACCA nowhere provides that convictions in tried and pleaded cases should be regarded differently, and nothing in Taylor\\'s rationale limits it to prior jury convictions. This Court, then, must find the right analogs for applying Taylor to pleaded cases. The Taylor Court drew a pragmatic conclusion about the best way to identify generic convictions in jury cases. In cases tried without a jury, the closest analogs to jury instructions would be a bench-trial judge\\'s formal ruling of law and finding of fact; in pleaded cases, they would be the statement of factual basis for the charge shown by a transcript of plea colloquy or by written plea agreement presented to the court, or by a record of comparable findings of fact adopted by the defendant upon entering the plea. A later court could generally tell from such material whether the prior plea had \"necessarily\" rested on the fact identifying the burglary as generic. Taylor, supra, at 602. The Government\\'s arguments for a wider evidentiary cast that includes documents submitted to lower courts even prior to charges amount to a call to ease away from Taylor\\'s conclusion that respect for congressional intent and avoidance of collateral trials require confining generic conviction evidence to the convicting court\\'s records approaching the certainty of the record of conviction in a generic crime State. That was the heart of the Taylor decision, and there is no justification for upsetting that precedent where the Court is dealing with statutory interpretation and where Congress has not, in the nearly 15 years since Taylor, taken any action to modify the statute. Pp. 19-23, 26.\\nJUSTICE SOUTER, joined by JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE SCALIA, and JUSTICE GINSBURG, concluded in Part III that the rule in the Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 243, n. 6, and Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490, line of cases—that any fact other than a prior conviction sufficient to raise the limit of the possible federal sentence must be found by a jury, absent a waiver by the defendant—is also relevant to ACCA sentencing. In a nongeneric State, the fact necessary to show a generic crime is not established by the record of conviction as it would be in a generic State when a judicial finding of a disputed prior conviction is made on the authority of Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224. Instead, the sentencing judge considering the ACCA enhancement would (on the Government\\'s view) make a disputed finding of fact about what the defendant and state judge must have understood as the prior plea\\'s factual basis, and the dispute raises the concern underlying Jones and Apprendi: the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee a jury\\'s standing between a defendant and the power of the State, and they guarantee a jury\\'s finding of any disputed fact essential to increase a potential sentence\\'s ceiling. The disputed fact here is too far removed from the conclusive significance of a prior judicial record, and too much like the findings subject to Jones and Apprendi, to say that Almendarez-Torres clearly authorizes a judge to resolve the dispute. The rule of reading statutes to avoid serious risks of unconstitutionality therefore counsels the Court to limit the scope of judicial factfinding on the disputed generic character of a prior plea. Pp. 24-26.\\nJUSTICE THOMAS agreed that the Court should not broaden the scope of the evidence judges may consider under Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575, because it would give rise to constitutional error, not constitutional doubt. Both Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224, and Taylor, which permit judicial factfinding that concerns prior convictions, have been eroded by this Court\\'s subsequent Sixth Amendment jurisprudence.

With him on the brief were Acting Solicitor General Clement, Assistant Attorney General Wray, and Deputy Solicitor General Dreeben.*\\nJUSTICE SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part III.\\n\\n\\n1\\nTitle 18 U. S. C. § 924(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. II), popularly known as the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), mandates a minimum 15-year prison sentence for anyone possessing a firearm after three prior convictions for serious drug offenses or violent felonies. The Act makes burglary a violent felony only if committed in a building or enclosed space (\"generic burglary\"), not in a boat or motor vehicle. In Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575 (1990), we held that a court sentencing under the ACCA could look to statutory elements, charging documents, and jury instructions to determine whether an earlier conviction after trial was for generic burglary. The question here is whether a sentencing court can look to police reports or complaint applications to determine whether an earlier guilty plea necessarily admitted, and supported a conviction for, generic burglary. We hold that it may not, and that a later court determining the character of an admitted burglary is generally limited to examining the statutory definition, charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\\n\\n\\n2\\n* Petitioner Reginald Shepard was indicted under 18 U. S. C. § 922(g)(1), barring felons from possessing a firearm, and pleaded guilty. At sentencing the Government claimed that Shepard\\'s prior convictions raised his sentencing range from between 30 and 37 months (under the United States Sentencing Guidelines) to the 15-year minimum required by § 924(e), pointing to four prior convictions entered upon Shepard\\'s pleas of guilty under one of Massachusetts\\'s two burglary statutes.1 Whereas the Government said that each conviction represented a predicate ACCA offense of generic burglary, the District Court ruled that Taylor barred counting any of the prior convictions as predicates for the mandatory minimum. 125 F. Supp. 2d 562, 569 (Mass. 2000).\\n\\n\\n3\\nIn Taylor we read the listing of \"burglary\" as a predicate \"violent felony\" (in the ACCA) to refer to what we called \"generic burglary,\" an \"unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\" 495 U. S., at 599. Because statutes in some States (like Massachusetts) define burglary more broadly, as by extending it to entries into boats and cars, we had to consider how a later court sentencing under the ACCA might tell whether a prior burglary conviction was for the generic offense.2 We held that the ACCA generally prohibits the later court from delving into particular facts disclosed by the record of conviction, thus leaving the court normally to \"look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\" Id., at 602. We recognized an exception to this \"categorical approach\" only for \"a narrow range of cases where a jury [in a State with a broader definition of burglary] was actually required to find all the elements of\" the generic offense. Ibid. We held the exception applicable \"if the indictment or information and jury instructions show that the defendant was charged only with a burglary of a building, and that the jury necessarily had to find an entry of a building to convict ....\" Ibid. Only then might a conviction under a \"nongeneric\" burglary statute qualify as an ACCA predicate.\\n\\n\\n4\\nIn this case, the offenses charged in state complaints were broader than generic burglary, and there were of course no jury instructions that might have narrowed the charges to the generic limit. The Government nonetheless urged the District Court to examine reports submitted by the police with applications for issuance of the complaints, as a way of telling whether Shepard\\'s guilty pleas went to generic burglaries notwithstanding the broader descriptions of the offenses in the complaints, descriptions that tracked the more expansive definition in Massachusetts law. The court concluded that Taylor forbade this, and that investigation within the Taylor limits failed to show that Shepard had three generic burglary convictions. The court accordingly refused to consider the 15-year mandatory minimum, though it did sentence Shepard somewhat above the standard level under the Sentencing Guidelines, on the ground that his criminal history category under the Guidelines did not do justice to his ample criminal record.\\n\\n\\n5\\nOn appeal the First Circuit, following its earlier decision in United States v. Harris, 964 F. 2d 1234 (1992), vacated the sentence and ruled that complaint applications and police reports may count as \"sufficiently reliable evidence for determining whether a defendant\\'s plea of guilty constitutes an admission to a generically violent crime,\" 231 F. 3d 56, 67 (2000). As to each of Shepard\\'s prior convictions, the court remanded the case for the District Court to determine whether there was \"sufficiently reliable evidence that the government and the defendant shared the belief that the defendant was pleading guilty to a generically violent crime.\" Id., at 70.\\n\\n\\n6\\nThe District Court again declined to impose the 15-year mandatory minimum, even though the Government supplemented its earlier submission with police reports or complaint applications on two additional burglary convictions. The District Judge noted that the only account of what occurred at each of the prior plea hearings came from an affidavit submitted by Shepard, who stated \"that none of the details in th[e police] reports w[as] ever mentioned at his pleas,\" that \"the reports themselves were never read by the judge to him during the plea colloquy,\" and that at no time \"was he ever asked if the information contained in the ... [r]eports w[as] true.\" 181 F. Supp. 2d 14, 19 (Mass. 2002). Shepard further swore that \"with respect to each report: [he] did not admit the truth of the information contained in the ... [r]eport as part of [his] plea and [had] never admitted in court the facts alleged in the report ....\" Id., at 19-20 (internal quotation marks omitted). Based on this, the District Court found that the Government had failed to carry its burden to demonstrate that Shepard had pleaded to three generic burglaries.\\n\\n\\n7\\nThe Court of Appeals again vacated the sentence. After observing that Shepard had never \"seriously disputed\" that he did in fact break into the buildings described in the police reports or complaint applications, 348 F. 3d 308, 311 (CA1 2003), the court rejected the District Court\\'s conclusion that the Government had not shown the requisite predicate offenses for the 15-year minimum sentence, id., at 314. The case was remanded with instructions to impose that sentence.\\n\\n\\n8\\nWe granted certiorari, 542 U. S. 918 (2004), to address divergent decisions in the Courts of Appeals applying Taylor when prior convictions stem from guilty pleas, not jury verdicts. We now reverse.\\n\\nII\\n\\n9\\nWe agree with the First Circuit (and every other Court of Appeals to speak on the matter) that guilty pleas may establish ACCA predicate offenses and that Taylor\\'s reasoning controls the identification of generic convictions following pleas, as well as convictions on verdicts, in States with non-generic offenses. See 348 F. 3d, at 312, n. 4 (citing cases). Shepard wisely refrains from challenging this position, for the ACCA nowhere provides that convictions in tried and pleaded cases are to be regarded differently. It drops no hint that Congress contemplated different standards for establishing the fact of prior convictions, turning on the basis of trial or plea. Nothing to that effect is suggested, after all, by the language imposing the categorical approach, which refers to predicate offenses in terms not of prior conduct but of prior \"convictions\" and the \"element[s]\" of crimes. Taylor, 495 U.S., at 600-601 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)). Nor does the Act\\'s legislative history reveal a lesser congressional preference for a categorical, as distinct from fact-specific, approach to recognizing ACCA predicates in cases resolved by plea. Taylor, 495 U. S., at 601. And certainly, \"the practical difficulties and potential unfairness of a factual approach are daunting,\" ibid., no less in pleaded than in litigated cases. Finally, nothing in Taylor\\'s rationale limits it to prior jury convictions; our discussion of the practical difficulties inherent in looking into underlying circumstances spoke specifically of \"cases where the defendant pleaded guilty, [in which] there often is no record of the underlying facts.\" Ibid. Our job, then, is to find the right analogs for applying the Taylor rule to pleaded cases.\\n\\n\\n10\\nThe Taylor Court drew a pragmatic conclusion about the best way to identify generic convictions in jury cases, while respecting Congress\\'s adoption of a categorical criterion that avoids subsequent evidentiary enquiries into the factual basis for the earlier conviction. The Court held that generic burglary could be identified only by referring to charging documents filed in the court of conviction, or to recorded judicial acts of that court limiting convictions to the generic category, as in giving instruction to the jury.\\n\\n\\n11\\nThe Court did not, however, purport to limit adequate judicial record evidence strictly to charges and instructions, id., at 602 (discussing the use of these documents as an \"example\"), since a conviction might follow trial to a judge alone or a plea of guilty. In cases tried without a jury, the closest analogs to jury instructions would be a bench-trial judge\\'s formal rulings of law and findings of fact, and in pleaded cases they would be the statement of factual basis for the charge, Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(a)(3), shown by a transcript of plea colloquy or by written plea agreement presented to the court, or by a record of comparable findings of fact adopted by the defendant upon entering the plea.3 With such material in a pleaded case, a later court could generally tell whether the plea had \"necessarily\" rested on the fact identifying the burglary as generic, Taylor, supra, at 602, just as the details of instructions could support that conclusion in the jury case, or the details of a generically limited charging document would do in any sort of case.\\n\\n\\n12\\nThe Government argues for a wider evidentiary cast, however, going beyond conclusive records made or used in adjudicating guilt and looking to documents submitted to lower courts even prior to charges. It argues for considering a police report submitted to a local court as grounds for issuing a complaint under a nongeneric statute; if that report alleges facts that would satisfy the elements of a generic statute, the report should suffice to show that a later plea and conviction were for a predicate offense under the ACCA. There would be no reason for concern about unavailable witnesses or stale memories, the Government points out, and such limited enquiry would be consistent with Taylor because \"[t]he underlying purpose [would be] the same as in examining the charging paper and jury instructions (which the Court endorsed in Taylor): to determine the nature of the offense of which petitioner was convicted, rather than to determine what he actually did.\" Brief for United States 22-23. The Government stresses three points.\\n\\n\\n13\\nFirst, it says that the more accommodating view of evidence competent to prove that the plea was to a generic offense will yield reliable conclusions. Although the records of Shepard\\'s pleas with their notations that he \"[a]dmit[ted] suff[icient] facts\" do not necessarily show that he admitted entering buildings or structures, as would be true under a generic burglary statute or charge, the police reports suffice to show that the record of admitting sufficient facts \"can only have plausibly rested on petitioner\\'s entry of a building.\" Id., at 25.\\n\\n\\n14\\nSecond, the Government pulls a little closer to Taylor\\'s demand for certainty when identifying a generic offense by emphasizing that the records of the prior convictions used in this case are in each instance free from any inconsistent, competing evidence on the pivotal issue of fact separating generic from nongeneric burglary. \"[T]here is nothing in the record to indicate that petitioner had pleaded guilty based on entering a ship or vehicle on any of the occasions at issue.\" Brief for United States 16.\\n\\n\\n15\\nFinally, the Government supports its call for a more inclusive standard of competent evidence by invoking the virtue of a nationwide application of a federal statute unaffected by idiosyncrasies of recordkeeping in any particular State. A bar on review of documents like police reports and complaint applications would often make the ACCA sentencing enhancement \"hinge on the happenstance of state court record-keeping practices and the vagaries of state prosecutors\\' charging practices.\" Brief in Opposition 13 (internal quotation marks omitted).\\n\\n\\n16\\nOn each point, however, the Government\\'s position raises an uncomfortable implication: every one of its arguments could have been pressed in favor of an enquiry beyond what Taylor allows when a jury conviction follows nongeneric instructions, and each is therefore as much a menace to Taylor as a justification for an expansive approach to showing whether a guilty plea admitted the generic crime. If the transcript of a jury trial showed testimony about a building break, one could say that the jury\\'s verdict rested on a finding to that effect. If the trial record showed no evidence of felonious entrance to anything but a building or structure, the odds that the offense actually committed was generic burglary would be a turf accountant\\'s dream. And, again, if it were significant that vagaries of abbreviated plea records could limit the application of the ACCA, the significance would be no less when the disputed, predicate conviction followed a jury trial and the stenographic notes of the charge had been thrown away.\\n\\n\\n17\\nThe Government\\'s position thus amounts to a call to ease away from the Taylor conclusion, that respect for congressional intent and avoidance of collateral trials require that evidence of generic conviction be confined to records of the convicting court approaching the certainty of the record of conviction in a generic crime State. But that limitation was the heart of the decision, and we cannot have Taylor and the Government\\'s position both.\\n\\n\\n18\\nThere is not, however, any sufficient justification for upsetting precedent here. We are, after all, dealing with an issue of statutory interpretation, see, e. g., Taylor, 495 U. S., at 602, and the claim to adhere to case law is generally powerful once a decision has settled statutory meaning, see Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172-173 (1989) (\"Considerations of stare decisis have special force in the area of statutory interpretation, for here, unlike in the context of constitutional interpretation, the legislative power is implicated, and Congress remains free to alter what we have done\"). In this instance, time has enhanced even the usual precedential force, nearly 15 years having passed since Taylor came down, without any action by Congress to modify the statute as subject to our understanding that it allowed only a restricted look beyond the record of conviction under a nongeneric statute.4\\n\\nIII\\n\\n19\\nDevelopments in the law since Taylor, and since the First Circuit\\'s decision in Harris, provide a further reason to adhere to the demanding requirement that any sentence under the ACCA rest on a showing that a prior conviction \"necessarily\" involved (and a prior plea necessarily admitted) facts equating to generic burglary. The Taylor Court, indeed, was prescient in its discussion of problems that would follow from allowing a broader evidentiary enquiry. \"If the sentencing court were to conclude, from its own review of the record, that the defendant [who was convicted under a non-generic burglary statute] actually committed a generic burglary, could the defendant challenge this conclusion as abridging his right to a jury trial?\" 495 U. S., at 601. The Court thus anticipated the very rule later imposed for the sake of preserving the Sixth Amendment right, that any fact other than a prior conviction sufficient to raise the limit of the possible federal sentence must be found by a jury, in the absence of any waiver of rights by the defendant. Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 243, n. 6 (1999); see also Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000).\\n\\n\\n20\\nThe Government dismisses the relevance of the Jones-Apprendi implementation of the jury right here by describing the determination necessary to apply the ACCA as \"involv[ing] only an assessment of what the state court itself already has been `required to find\\' in order to find the defendant guilty.\" Brief for United States 38 (quoting Taylor, supra, at 602). But it is not that simple. The problem is that \"what the state court ... has been `required to find\\'\" is debatable. In a nongeneric State, the fact necessary to show a generic crime is not established by the record of conviction as it would be in a generic State when a judicial finding of a disputed prior conviction is made on the authority of Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998). The state statute requires no finding of generic burglary, and without a charging document that narrows the charge to generic limits, the only certainty of a generic finding lies in jury instructions, or bench-trial findings and rulings, or (in a pleaded case) in the defendant\\'s own admissions or accepted findings of fact confirming the factual basis for a valid plea. In this particular pleaded case, the record is silent on the generic element, there being no plea agreement or recorded colloquy in which Shepard admitted the generic fact.\\n\\n\\n21\\nInstead, the sentencing judge considering the ACCA enhancement would (on the Government\\'s view) make a disputed finding of fact about what the defendant and state judge must have understood as the factual basis of the prior plea, and the dispute raises the concern underlying Jones and Apprendi: the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee a jury standing between a defendant and the power of the state, and they guarantee a jury\\'s finding of any disputed fact essential to increase the ceiling of a potential sentence. While the disputed fact here can be described as a fact about a prior conviction, it is too far removed from the conclusive significance of a prior judicial record, and too much like the findings subject to Jones and Apprendi, to say that Almendarez-Torres clearly authorizes a judge to resolve the dispute. The rule of reading statutes to avoid serious risks of unconstitutionality, see Jones, supra, at 239, therefore counsels us to limit the scope of judicial factfinding on the disputed generic character of a prior plea, just as Taylor constrained judicial findings about the generic implication of a jury\\'s verdict.5\\n\\nIV\\n\\n22\\nWe hold that enquiry under the ACCA to determine whether a plea of guilty to burglary defined by a nongeneric statute necessarily admitted elements of the generic offense is limited to the terms of the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant, or to some comparable judicial record of this information.\\n\\n\\n23\\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.\\n\\n\\n24\\n\\nIt is so ordered.\\n\\n\\n\\n25\\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the decision of this case.\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\n\\n*\\n Gregory L. Poe, Roy T. Englert, Jr., Max Huffman, and Pamela Harris filed a brief for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as amicus curiae urging reversal.\\n\\n\\n1\\n The Government initially cited a fifth prior burglary conviction, but after failing to obtain adequate documentation about this conviction the Government focused on the other four\\n\\n\\n2\\n AlthoughTaylor involved prior burglaries, as this case does, our holding in Taylor covered other predicate ACCA offenses. 495 U. S., at 600.\\n\\n\\n3\\n Several Courts of Appeals have taken a similar view, approving the use of some or all of these documentsUnited States v. Bonat, 106 F. 3d 1472, 1476-1477 (CA9 1997); United States v. Maness, 23 F. 3d 1006, 1009-1010 (CA6 1994); United States v. Smith, 10 F. 3d 724, 733-734 (CA10 1993) (per curiam) (construing United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual § 4B1.2 (Nov. 1990)).\\n\\n\\n4\\n Like the Government, the dissent would allow district courts to examine a wider range of documents than we approve today, and its proposal is no more consistent withTaylor than the Government\\'s. Taylor is clear that any enquiry beyond statute and charging document must be narrowly restricted to implement the object of the statute and avoid evidentiary disputes. In the case before it, the Court drew the line after allowing courts to review documents showing \"that the jury necessarily had to find an entry of a building to convict.\" 495 U.S., at 602; see also ibid. (permitting a sentencing court to look beyond the state statute \"in a narrow range of cases where a jury was actually required to find all the elements of generic burglary\"). As we say in the text, there are certainly jury trials with record documents like those at issue here, never introduced at trial but \"uncontradicted,\" post, at 31 (opinion of O\\'CONNOR, J.), and \"internally consistent,\" ibid., with the evidence that came in. The dissent would presumably permit examination of such documents, but Taylor assuredly does not.\\nThe only way to reconcile the dissent\\'s approach with Taylor is to say that in Taylor the prior convictions followed jury verdicts while in this case each prior conviction grew out of a guilty plea. See post, at 36 (\"Taylor itself set no rule for guilty pleas\"). But Taylor has no suggestion that its reasoning would not apply in plea cases, and its discussion of the practical difficulties specifically referred to prior guilty pleas. 495 U. S., at 601. Moreover, as we have noted, see supra, at 19, and as the dissent nowhere disputes, the ACCA provides no support for such a distinction. We decline to create a distinction that Congress evidently had no desire to draw, that Taylor did not envision, and that we would be hard pressed to explain.\\n\\n\\n5\\n The dissent charges that our decision may portend the extension ofApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), to proof of prior convictions, a move which (if it should occur) \"surely will do no favors for future defendants in Shepard\\'s shoes.\" Post, at 38. According to the dissent, the Government, bearing the burden of proving the defendant\\'s prior burglaries to the jury, would then have the right to introduce evidence of those burglaries at trial, and so threaten severe prejudice to the defendant. It is up to the future to show whether the dissent is good prophesy, but the dissent\\'s apprehensiveness can be resolved right now, for if the dissent turns out to be right that Apprendi will reach further, any defendant who feels that the risk of prejudice is too high can waive the right to have a jury decide questions about his prior convictions.\\n\\n\\n\\n26\\nJUSTICE THOMAS, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.\\n\\n\\n27\\nApprendi v.

S. 466 (2000), and its progeny prohibit judges from \"mak[ing] a finding that raises [a defendant\\'s] sentence beyond the sentence that could have lawfully been imposed by reference to facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant.\" United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 317-318 (2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting in part). Yet that is what the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U. S. C. § 924(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. II), permits in this case. Petitioner Reginald Shepard pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U. S. C. § 922(g)(1), which exposed him to a maximum sentence of 10 years under § 924(a)(2) and a Federal Sentencing Guidelines range of 30-to-37 months. However, § 924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. II) mandated a minimum 15-year sentence if Shepard had three previous convictions for \"a violent felony or a serious drug offense.\" Shepard has never conceded that his prior state-court convictions qualify as violent felonies or serious drug offenses under § 924(e). Even so, the Court of Appeals resolved this contested factual matter by ordering the District Court to impose the enhancement on remand.\\n\\n\\n28\\nThe constitutional infirmity of § 924(e)(1) as applied to Shepard makes today\\'s decision an unnecessary exercise. Nevertheless, the plurality today refines the rule of Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575 (1990), and further instructs district courts on the evidence they may consider in determining whether prior state convictions are § 924(e) predicate offenses. Taylor and today\\'s decision thus explain to lower courts how to conduct factfinding that is, according to the logic of this Court\\'s intervening precedents, unconstitutional in this very case. The need for further refinement of Taylor endures because this Court has not yet reconsidered Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998), which draws an exception to the Apprendi line of cases for judicial factfinding that concerns a defendant\\'s prior convictions. See Apprendi, supra, at 487-490.\\n\\n\\n29\\nAlmendarez-Torres, like Taylor, has been eroded by this Court\\'s subsequent Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, and a majority of the Court now recognizes that Almendarez-Torres was wrongly decided. See 523 U. S., at 248-249 (SCALIA, J., joined by STEVENS, SOUTER, and GINSBURG, JJ., dissenting); Apprendi, supra, at 520-521 (THOMAS, J., concurring). The parties do not request it here, but in an appropriate case, this Court should consider Almendarez-Torres\\' continuing viability. Innumerable criminal defendants have been unconstitutionally sentenced under the flawed rule of Almendarez-Torres, despite the fundamental \"imperative that the Court maintain absolute fidelity to the protections of the individual afforded by the notice, trial by jury, and beyond-a-reasonable-doubt requirements.\" Harris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545, 581-582 (2002) (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\\n\\n\\n30\\nIn my view, broadening the evidence judges may consider when finding facts under Taylor — by permitting sentencing courts to look beyond charging papers, jury instructions, and plea agreements to an assortment of other documents such as complaint applications and police reports — would not give rise to constitutional doubt, as the plurality believes. See ante, at 24-26. It would give rise to constitutional error, no less than does the limited factfinding that Taylor\\'s rule permits. For this reason, as well as those set forth in Parts I, II, and IV of the Court\\'s opinion, the Court correctly declines to broaden the scope of the evidence judges may consider under Taylor. But because the factfinding procedure the Court rejects gives rise to constitutional error, not doubt, I cannot join Part III of the opinion.\\n\\n\\n31\\nJUSTICE O\\'CONNOR, with whom JUSTICE KENNEDY and JUSTICE BREYER join, dissenting.\\n\\n\\n32\\nThe Court today adopts a rule that is not compelled by statute or by this Court\\'s precedent, that makes little sense as a practical matter, and that will substantially frustrate Congress\\' scheme for punishing repeat violent offenders who violate federal gun laws. The Court is willing to acknowledge that the petitioner\\'s prior state burglary convictions occurred, and that they involved unpermitted entries with intent to commit felonies. But the Court refuses to accept one additional, commonsense inference, based on substantial documentation and without any evidence to the contrary: that petitioner was punished for his entries into buildings.\\n\\n\\n33\\nThe petitioner, Reginald Shepard, has never actually denied that the prior crimes at issue were burglaries of buildings. Nor has he denied that, in pleading guilty to those crimes, he understood himself to be accepting punishment for burglarizing buildings. Instead, seeking to benefit from the unavailability of certain old court records and from a minor ambiguity in the prior crimes\\' charging documents, petitioner asks us to foreclose any resort to the clear and uncontradicted background documents that gave rise to and supported his earlier convictions.\\n\\n\\n34\\nThe Court acquiesces in that wish and instructs the federal courts to ignore all but the narrowest evidence regarding an Armed Career Criminal Act defendant\\'s prior guilty pleas. I respectfully dissent.\\n\\n\\n35\\n* The Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) mandates a 15-year minimum sentence for certain federal firearms violations where the defendant has three prior convictions for a \"violent felony.\" 18 U. S. C. § 924(e). In defining violent felonies for this purpose, Congress has specified that the term includes any crime, punishable by more than one year\\'s imprisonment, that \"is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). We held in Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575 (1990), that the statute\\'s use of the term \"burglary\" was meant to encompass only what we described as \"generic\" burglary, a crime with three elements: (1) \"unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in,\" (2) \"a building or structure,\" (3) \"with intent to commit a crime.\" Id., at 598-599.\\n\\n\\n36\\nThat left the problem of how to determine whether a defendant\\'s past conviction qualified as a conviction for generic burglary. The most formalistic approach would have been to find the ACCA requirement satisfied only when the statute under which the defendant was convicted was one limited to \"generic\" burglary. But Taylor wisely declined to follow that course. The statutes which some States — like Massachusetts here, or Missouri in Taylor — use to prosecute generic burglary are overbroad for ACCA purposes: They are not limited to \"generic\" burglary, but also punish the nongeneric kind. Restricting the sentencing court\\'s inquiry to the face of the statute would have frustrated the purposes of the ACCA by allowing some violent recidivists convicted of federal gun crimes to escape the ACCA\\'s heightened punishment based solely on the fortuity of where they had committed their previous crimes.\\n\\n\\n37\\nInstead, Taylor adopted a more \"pragmatic\" approach. Ante, at 20 (majority opinion). Every statute punishes a certain set of criminalized actions; the problem with some burglary statutes, for purposes of the ACCA, is that they are overinclusive. But Taylor permitted a federal court to \"go beyond the mere fact of conviction\" — and to determine, by using other sources, whether the defendant\\'s prior crime was in the subset of the statutory crime qualifying as generic burglary. For example, where a defendant\\'s prior conviction occurred by jury trial, Taylor instructed the federal court to review \"the indictment or information and jury instructions\" from the earlier conviction, to see whether they had \"required the jury to find all the elements of generic burglary in order to convict.\" 495 U. S., at 602.\\n\\n\\n38\\nAs the Court recognizes, however, Taylor\\'s use of that one example did not purport to be exhaustive. See ante, at 20-21. See also United States v. Harris, 964 F. 2d 1234, 1236 (CA1 1992) (Breyer, C. J.). Rather, Taylor left room for courts to determine which other reliable and simple sources might aid in determining whether a defendant had in fact been convicted of generic burglary. The Court identifies several such sources that a sentencing judge may consult under the ACCA: the \"charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\" Ante, at 16. I would expand that list to include any uncontradicted, internally consistent parts of the record from the earlier conviction. That would include the two sources the First Circuit relied upon in this case.\\n\\n\\n39\\nShepard\\'s four prior convictions all occurred by guilty pleas to charges under Massachusetts\\' two burglary statutes — statutes that punish \"[w]hoever ... breaks and enters a building, ship, vessel or vehicle, with intent to commit a felony.\" Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 266, § 16 (West 2000) (emphasis added); see also § 18. The criminal complaints used as charging documents for the convictions at issue did not specify that Shepard\\'s offenses had involved a building, but instead closely copied the more inclusive language of the appropriate statute. If these complaints were the only evidence of the factual basis of Shepard\\'s guilty pleas, then I would agree with the majority that there was no way to know whether those convictions were for burglarizing a building. But the Government did have additional evidence. For each of the convictions, the Government had both the applications by which the police had secured the criminal complaints and the police reports attached to those applications. Those documents decisively show that Shepard\\'s illegal act in each prior conviction was the act of entering a building. Moreover, they make inescapable the conclusion that, at each guilty plea, Shepard understood himself to be admitting the crime of breaking into a building.\\n\\n\\n40\\nConsider, for instance, the first burglary conviction at issue. The complaint for that conviction alleged that, on May 6, 1989, Shepard \"did break and enter in the night time the building, ship, vessel or vehicle, the property of Jerri Cothran, with intent to commit a felony therein\" in violation of § 16. 3 App. 5. The place of the offense was alleged as \"30 Harlem St.,\" and the complaint contained a cross-reference to \"CC#91-394783.\"\\n\\n\\n41\\nThe majority would have us stop there. Since both the statute and the charging document name burglary of a \"building, ship, vessel or vehicle,\" the majority concludes that there is no way to tell whether Massachusetts punished Shepard for transgressing its laws by burglarizing a building, or for doing so by burglarizing a vehicle, ship, or vessel. (Although the majority would also allow a look at Shepard\\'s written plea agreement or a transcript of the plea proceedings, those items are no longer available in Shepard\\'s case, since Massachusetts has apparently seen little need to preserve the miscellany of long-past convictions.)\\n\\n\\n42\\nI would look as well to additional portions of the record from that plea — the complaint application and police report. The complaint application lists the same statute, describes (in abbreviated form) the same offense, names the same victim and address, and contains the same reference number (though differently hyphenated) as the complaint itself. In addition, the application specifies as relevant \"PROPERTY\" (meaning \"Goods stolen, what destroyed, etc.\") a \"Cellar Door.\" Id., at 6. The police report (which also names the same victim, date, and place of offense, and contains the same reference number as the other two documents) gives substantially more detail about why Massachusetts began criminal proceedings against Shepard:\\n\\n\\n43\\n\"[R]esponded to [radio call] to 30 Harlem St. for B-E in progress. On arrival observed cellar door in rear had been broken down. Spoke to victim who stated that approx 3:00 a.m. she heard noises downstairs. She then observed suspect ... in her pantry.\" Id., at 7.\\n\\n\\n44\\nThree points need to be made about the relationship between the complaint (whose use the majority finds completely unobjectionable) and the application and police report (which I would also consider). First, all of the documents concern the same crime. Second, the three documents are entirely consistent — nothing in any of them casts doubt on the veracity of the others. Finally, and most importantly, the common understanding behind all three documents was that, whatever the range of conduct punishable by the state statute, this defendant was being prosecuted for burglary of a building. See 348 F. 3d 308, 314 (CA1 2003) (\"[T]here is a compelling inference that the plea was to the complaint and that the complaint embodied the events described in the application or police report in the case file\").\\n\\n\\n45\\nThere certainly is no evidence in the record contradicting that understanding. Notably, throughout these proceedings, Shepard has never denied that the four guilty pleas at issue involved breaking into buildings. Nor has he denied that his contemporaneous understanding of each plea was that, as a result of his admission, he would be punished for having broken into a building. During his federal sentencing hearings, Shepard did submit an affidavit about his prior convictions. But that affidavit carefully dances around the key issues of what Shepard actually did to run afoul of the law and what he thought was the substance of his guilty plea. Rather, the affidavit focuses on what the judge said to Shepard at the hearing and what Shepard said in response. Even in that regard, the affidavit is strangely ambiguous. In discussing the first conviction, for instance, the affidavit states that \"the judge [who took the plea] did not read\" the police report to Shepard, \"and did not ask me whether or not the information contained in the ... report was true.\" 1 App. 100. See also ibid. (\"I did not admit the truth of the information contained in the ... report as part of my plea and I have never admitted in court that the facts alleged in the reports are true\"). The affidavit\\'s statements about the other three prior convictions are similar.\\n\\n\\n46\\nThose statements could be taken as Shepard\\'s denial that he was ever asked about (or ever admitted to) any of the specific facts of his crime that happen to be mentioned in the police reports — facts like the date and place of the offense, whether he entered through a cellar door and proceeded to the pantry, and so on. But to believe that, we would have to presume that all four Massachusetts courts violated their duty under state law to ensure themselves of the factual basis for Shepard\\'s plea. In Massachusetts, \"[a] defendant\\'s choice to plead guilty will not alone support conviction; the defendant\\'s guilt in fact must be established.\" Commonwealth v. DelVerde, 398 Mass. 288, 296, 496 N. E. 2d 1357, 1362 (1986). As a result, even if \"the defendant admits to the crime in open court, ... a court may not convict unless there are sufficient facts on the record to establish each element of the offense.\" Id., at 297, 496 N. E. 2d, at 1363. See also Commonwealth v. Colon, 439 Mass. 519, 529, n. 13, 789 N. E. 2d 566, 573, n. 13 (2003) (guilty plea requires admission to the facts); 2 E. Blumenson, S. Fisher, & D. Kanstroom, Massachusetts Criminal Practice § 37.7B, p. 288 (1998) (\"Usually this is accomplished by the recitation of either the grand jury minutes or police reports, but defendant\\'s admissions during the plea, or trial evidence, can also support the factual basis\" (footnote omitted)). Cf. Commonwealth v. Forde, 392 Mass. 453, 458, 466 N. E. 2d 510, 513 (1984) (conviction cannot be based on uncorroborated confession; rather, there must be some evidence that the crime was \"real and not imaginary\"). It is thus unlikely that Shepard really intended his affidavit as a statement that none of the various facts found in the police reports were ever admitted by him or discussed in his presence during his guilty pleas.\\n\\n\\n47\\nMore likely, Shepard\\'s attorney carefully phrased the affidavit so that it would admit of a different meaning: that the plea courts never asked, and Shepard never answered, the precise question: \"Is what the police report says true?\" But I fail to see how that is relevant, so long as Shepard understood that, in pleading guilty, he was agreeing to be punished for the building break-in that was the subject of the entire proceeding.\\n\\n\\n48\\nThere may be some scenarios in which — as the result of charge bargaining, for instance, or due to unexpected twists in an investigation — a defendant\\'s guilty plea is premised on substantially different facts than those that were the basis for the original police investigation. In such a case, a defendant might well be confused about the practical meaning of his admission of guilt. Cf. Taylor, 495 U. S., at 601-602 (\"[I]f a guilty plea to a lesser, nonburglary offense was the result of a plea bargain, it would seem unfair to impose a sentence enhancement as if the defendant had pleaded guilty to burglary\"). But there is no claim of such circumstances here: All signs are that everyone involved in each prior plea — from the judge, to the prosecutor, to the defense lawyer, to Shepard himself — understood each plea as Shepard\\'s admission that he had broken into the building where the police caught him. Given each police report\\'s never-superseded allegation that Shepard had burglarized a building, it strains credulity beyond the breaking point to assert that, in each case, Shepard was actually prosecuted for and pleaded guilty to burglarizing a ship or a car. The lower court was surely right to detect \"an air of make-believe\" about Shepard\\'s case. 348 F. 3d, at 311.\\n\\n\\n49\\nThe majority\\'s rule, which forces the federal sentencing court to feign agnosticism about clearly knowable facts, cannot be squared with the ACCA\\'s twin goals of incapacitating repeat violent offenders, and of doing so consistently notwithstanding the peculiarities of state law. Cf. Taylor, supra, at 582 (\"`[I]n terms of fundamental fairness, the Act should ensure, to the extent that it is consistent with the prerogatives of the States in defining their own offenses, that the same type of conduct is punishable on the Federal level in all cases\\'\" (quoting S. Rep. No. 98-190, p. 20 (1983))). The Court\\'s overscrupulous regard for formality leads it not only to an absurd result, but also to a result that Congress plainly hoped to avoid.\\n\\nII\\n\\n50\\nThe Court gives two principal reasons for today\\'s ruling: adherence to the Court\\'s decision in Taylor, and constitutional concerns about the defendant\\'s right to a jury trial.\\n\\n\\n51\\nThe first is hardly convincing. As noted above, Taylor itself set no rule for guilty pleas, and its list of sources for a sentencing court to consider was not intended to be exhaustive. Supra, at 30-31. The First Circuit\\'s disposition of this case, therefore, was not in direct conflict with Taylor. Nor did it conflict with the spirit of Taylor. Taylor was in part about \"[f]air[ness]\" to defendants. 495 U. S., at 602. But there is nothing unfair (and a great deal that is positively just) about recognizing and acting upon plain and uncontradicted evidence that a defendant, in entering his prior plea, knew he was being prosecuted for and was pleading guilty to burglary of a building. Taylor also sought to avoid the impracticality of mini-sentencing-trials featuring opposing witnesses perusing lengthy transcripts of prior proceedings. Id., at 601. But no such problem presents itself in this case: The Government proposed using only the small documentary record behind Shepard\\'s pleas. Those documents relate to facts that Shepard does not dispute, and Shepard has not indicated any desire to submit counterevidence.\\n\\n\\n52\\nThe issue most central to Taylor was the need to effectuate Congress\\' \"categorical approach\" to sentencing recidivist federal offenders — an approach which responds to the reality of a defendant\\'s prior crimes, rather than the happenstance of how those crimes \"were labeled by state law.\" Id., at 589. But rather than promote this goal, the majority opinion today injects a new element of arbitrariness into the ACCA: A defendant\\'s sentence will now depend not only on the peculiarities of the statutes particular States use to prosecute generic burglary, but also on whether those States\\' record retention policies happen to preserve the musty \"written plea agreement[s]\" and recordings of \"plea colloqu[ies]\" ancillary to long-past convictions. Ante, at 16. In other words, with respect to this most critical issue, the majority\\'s rule is not consistent with Taylor at all.\\n\\n\\n53\\nThat is why I strongly suspect that the driving force behind today\\'s decision is not Taylor itself, but rather \"[d]evelopments in the law since Taylor.\" Ante, at 24 (plurality opinion). A majority of the Court defends its rule as necessary to avoid a result that might otherwise be unconstitutional under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), and related cases. Ante, at 24-26 (plurality opinion); ante, at 27-28 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). I have criticized that line of cases from the beginning, and I need not repeat my reasoning here. See Apprendi, supra, at 523 (dissenting opinion); Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 619 (2002) (dissenting opinion); Blakely v. Washington, 542 U. S. 296, 344-345 (2004) (dissenting opinion). See also Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 254 (1999) (KENNEDY, J., dissenting); Blakely, supra, at 340-344 (BREYER, J., dissenting); United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220, 327-331 (2005) (BREYER, J., dissenting). It is a battle I have lost.\\n\\n\\n54\\nBut it is one thing for the majority to apply its Apprendi rule within that rule\\'s own bounds, and quite another to extend the rule into new territory that Apprendi and succeeding cases had expressly and consistently disclaimed. Yet today\\'s decision reads Apprendi to cast a shadow possibly implicating recidivism determinations, which until now had been safe from such formalism. See Blakely, supra, at 301 (\"`Other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty of a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt\\'\" (emphasis added; quoting Apprendi, supra, at 490)). See also Booker, supra, at 244 (opinion of the Court by STEVENS, J.) (similar).\\n\\n\\n55\\nEven in a post-Apprendi world, I cannot understand how today\\'s case raises any reasonable constitutional concern. To the contrary, this case presents especially good reasons for respecting Congress\\' long \"tradition of treating recidivism as a sentencing factor\" determined by the judge, Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224, 243 (1998), rather than as a substantive offense element determined by the jury. First, Shepard\\'s prior convictions were themselves \"established through procedures satisfying the fair notice, reasonable doubt, and jury trial guarantees.\" Jones, supra, at 249. Second, as with most recidivism determinations, see Almendarez-Torres, supra, at 235, the burglary determination in Shepard\\'s case concerned an extremely narrow issue, with the relevant facts not seriously contested. See supra, at 33-35 (discussing shortcomings of Shepard\\'s affidavit). Finally, today\\'s hint at extending the Apprendi rule to the issue of ACCA prior crimes surely will do no favors for future defendants in Shepard\\'s shoes. When ACCA defendants in the future go to trial rather than plead guilty, the majority\\'s ruling in effect invites the Government, in prosecuting the federal gun charge, also \"to prove to the jury\" the defendant\\'s prior burglaries. Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S., at 234-235. \"[T]he introduction of evidence of a defendant\\'s prior crimes risks significant prejudice,\" id., at 235, and that prejudice is likely to be especially strong in ACCA cases, where the relevant prior crimes are, by definition, \"violent,\" 18 U. S. C. § 924(e). In short, whatever the merits of the Apprendi doctrine, that doctrine does not currently bear on, and should not be extended to bear on, determinations of a defendant\\'s past crimes, like the ACCA predicates at issue in Shepard\\'s case. The plurality\\'s concern about constitutional doubt, ante, at 24-26, and JUSTICE THOMAS\\' concern about constitutional error, ante, at 27-28, are therefore misplaced.\\n\\n\\n56\\n* * *\\n\\n\\n57\\nFor the reasons explained above, I would find that the First Circuit properly established the applicability of the ACCA sentence by looking to the complaint applications and police reports from the prior convictions. Because the Court concludes otherwise, I respectfully dissent.\\n\\n'}]\n",

AGUILAR.\\nNo. 94-270.\\nSupreme Court of the United States\\nArgued March 20, 1995.\\nDecided June 21, 1995.\\n\\n\\nSyllabus\\n*\\n\\nRespondent Aguilar, a United States District Judge, was convicted of illegally disclosing a wiretap in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2232(c), even though the authorization for the particular wiretap had expired before the disclosure was made.  Because he lied to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents during a grand jury investigation, he also was convicted of endeavoring to obstruct the due administration of justice under § 1503.  The Court of Appeals reversed both convictions, reasoning that Aguilar\\'s conduct in each instance was not covered by the statutory language.\\n\\nHeld:\\n\\n1. Uttering false statements to an investigating agent who might or might not testify before a grand jury is not sufficient to make out a violation of § 1503\\'s prohibition of \"endeavor[ing] to influence, obstruct, or impede . . . the due administration of justice.\"  The \"nexus\" requirement developed in recent court of appeals decisions—whereby the accused\\'s act must have a relationship in time, causation, or logic with grand jury or judicial proceedings—is a correct construction of § 1503\\'s very broad language.  Under that approach, the accused must take action with an intent to influence such proceedings;  it is not enough that there be an intent to influence some ancillary proceeding, such as an investigation independent of the court\\'s or grand jury\\'s authority.  Moreover, the endeavor must have the \"natural and probable effect\" of interfering with the due administration of justice, see, e.g., United States v. Wood, 6 F.3d 692, 695, and a person lacking knowledge that his actions are likely to affect a pending proceeding necessarily lacks the requisite intent to obstruct, Pettibone v. United States, 148 U.S. 197, 206-207, 13 S.Ct. 542, 546-547, 37 L.Ed. 419.  The Government did not show here that the FBI agents acted as an arm of the grand jury, that the grand jury had subpoenaed their testimony or otherwise directed them to appear, or that respondent knew that his false statements would be provided to the grand jury.  Indeed, the evidence goes no further than showing that respondent testified falsely to an investigating agent.  What use will be made of such testimony is so speculative that the testimony cannot be said to have the \"natural and probable effect\" of obstructing justice. Pp. ____.\\n2. Disclosure of a wiretap after its authorization expires violates § 2232(c), which provides criminal penalties for anyone who, \"[1] having knowledge that a Federal . . . officer has been authorized or has applied for authorization . . . to intercept a wire . . . communication, [2] in order to obstruct, impede, or prevent such interception, [3] gives notice or attempts to give notice of the possible interception to any person.\"  Contrary to the Court of Appeals\\' holding, the statutory language does not require that the wiretap application or authorization be pending or in esse at the time of the disclosure.  Such a narrow purpose is not evidenced by the term \"such interception\" in the statute\\'s second clause, which merely establishes that the defendant must intend to obstruct the interception made pursuant to the application or authorization of which he has the knowledge required by the first clause.  Similarly, the phrase \"possible interception\" in the third clause was not designed to limit the punishable offense to cases where the interception was factually \"possible,\" but was intended to recognize the fact that at the time the prohibited notice was given it very likely could not be known whether or not there would be an interception.  Moreover, without the word \"possible,\" the statute would only prohibit giving notice of \"the interception\":  It would not reach the giving of notice of an application which has not yet resulted in an authorization or an authorization which has not yet resulted in an interception.  Finally, the statute need not be read to exclude disclosures of expired wiretaps because of concern that a broader construction would run counter to the First Amendment.  The Government\\'s interest in nondisclosure by officials in sensitive confidential positions is quite sufficient to justify the construction of the statute as written, without any artificial narrowing because of First Amendment concerns.

In July 1987, he filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 to have his conviction set aside.  The motion was assigned to Judge Stanley Weigel.  Tham, seeking to enhance the odds that his petition would be granted, asked Edward Solomon and Abraham Chalupowitz, a.k.a. Abe Chapman, to assist him by capitalizing on their respective acquaintances with another judge in the Northern District of California, respondent Aguilar.  Respondent knew Chapman as a distant relation by marriage and knew Solomon from law school. Solomon and Chapman met with respondent to discuss Tham\\'s case, as a result of which respondent spoke with Judge Weigel about the matter.\\n\\n\\n3\\nIndependent of the embezzlement conviction, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) identified Tham as a suspect in an investigation of labor racketeering.  On April 20, 1987, the FBI applied for authorization to install a wiretap on Tham\\'s business phones.  Chapman appeared on the application as a potential interceptee.  Chief District Judge Robert Peckham authorized the wiretap.  The 30 day wiretap expired by law on May 20, 1987, 18 U.S.C. § 2518(5), but Chief Judge Peckham maintained the secrecy of the wiretap under 18 U.S.C. § 2518(8)(d) after a showing of good cause.  During the course of the racketeering investigation, the FBI learned of the meetings between Chapman and respondent. The FBI informed Chief Judge Peckham, who, concerned with appearances of impropriety, advised respondent in August 1987 that Chapman might be connected with criminal elements because Chapman\\'s name had appeared on a wiretap authorization.\\n\\n\\n4\\nFive months after respondent learned that Chapman had been named in a wiretap authorization, he noticed a man observing his home during a visit by Chapman.  He alerted his nephew to this fact and conveyed the message (with an intent that his nephew relay the information to Chapman) that Chapman\\'s phone was being wiretapped.  Respondent apparently believed, in error, both that Chapman\\'s phones were tapped in connection with the initial application and that the initial authorization was still in effect.  Chief Judge Peckham had in fact authorized another wiretap on Tham\\'s phones effective from October 1987 through the period in which respondent made the disclosure, but there is no suggestion in the record that the latter had any specific knowledge of this reauthorization.\\n\\n\\n5\\nAt this point, respondent\\'s involvement in the two separate Tham matters converged.  Two months after the disclosure to his nephew, a grand jury began to investigate an alleged conspiracy to influence the outcome of Tham\\'s habeas case.  Two FBI agents questioned respondent.  During the interview, respondent lied about his participation in the Tham case and his knowledge of the wiretap.  The grand jury returned an indictment;  a jury convicted Aguilar of one count of disclosing a wiretap, 18 U.S.C. § 2232(c), and one count of endeavoring to obstruct the due administration of justice, 18 U.S.C. § 1503.  A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the § 2232(c) conviction but reversed the § 1503 conviction.\\n\\n\\n6\\nOn rehearing en banc, the Court of Appeals reversed both convictions for the reason that the conduct in each instance was not covered by the statutory language.  21 F.3d 1475 (1994).  The court concluded that 18 U.S.C. § 2232(c) requires the disclosure of a pending wiretap application or an authorization that had not expired because the purpose of the statute was to thwart interference with the \" \\'possible interception\\' \" of the wiretap of which the defendant had knowledge.  Id., at 1480.  Finding the interception in this case impossible once the authorization had expired, it held respondent\\'s disclosure was not covered by the plain language of the statute.  The Court of Appeals also found that respondent had not interfered with a pending judicial proceeding under § 1503.  It first noted that the grand jury had not authorized or directed the FBI investigation.  It then held that merely uttering false statements does not \" \\'corruptly influence\\' \" within the meaning of the statute.  Id., at 1485-1486.  It drew this conclusion, in part, from 1988 amendments to 18 U.S.C. § 1512, which added a prohibition on corrupt persuasion of witnesses.  The court read the corrupt persuasion prohibited by § 1512 to require an active attempt to persuade a witness to tell a false story, and used the language in § 1512 as a guide to interpret the omnibus clause of § 1503 narrowly.\\n\\n\\n7\\n* Section 1503 provides:\\n\\n\\n8\\n\"Whoever corruptly, or by threats or force, or by any      threatening letter or communication, endeavors to influence,      intimidate, or impede any grand or petit juror, or officer in      or of any court of the United States, or officer who may be      serving at any examination or other proceeding before any      United States commissioner or other committing magistrate, in      the discharge of his duty, or injures any such grand or petit      juror in his person or property on account of any verdict or      indictment assented to by him, or on account of his being or      having been such juror, or injures any such officer,      commissioner, or other committing magistrate in his person or      property on account of the performance of his official      duties, or corruptly or by threats or force, or by any      threatening letter or communication, influences, obstructs,      or impedes, or endeavors to influence, obstruct,      or impede, the due administration of justice, shall be fined      not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years,      or both.\"  18 U.S.C. § 1503 (emphasis added).\\n\\n\\n9\\nThe statute is structured as follows:  first it proscribes persons from endeavoring to influence, intimidate, or impede grand or petit jurors or court officers in the discharge of their duties;  it then prohibits injuring grand or petit jurors in their person or property because of any verdict or indictment rendered by them;  it then prohibits injury of any court officer, commissioner, or similar officer on account of the performance of their official duties;  finally, the \"Omnibus Clause\" serves as a catchall, prohibiting persons from endeavoring to influence, obstruct, or impede the due administration of justice.  The latter clause, it can be seen, is far more general in scope than the earlier clauses of the statute.  Respondent was charged with a violation of the Omnibus Clause, to wit:  with \"corruptly endeavor[ing] to influence, obstruct and impede the . . . grand jury investigation.\"  App. 106.\\n\\n\\n10\\nThe first case from this Court construing the predecessor statute to § 1503 was Pettibone v. United States, 148 U.S. 197, 13 S.Ct. 542, 37 L.Ed. 419 (1893).  There we held that \"a person is not sufficiently charged with obstructing or impeding the due administration of justice in a court unless it appears that he knew or had notice that justice was being administered in such court.\"  Id., at 206, 13 S.Ct., at 546.  The Court reasoned that a person lacking knowledge of a pending proceeding necessarily lacked the evil intent to obstruct.  Id., at 207, 13 S.Ct., at 546-547.  Recent decisions of courts of appeals have likewise tended to place metes and bounds on the very broad language of the catchall provision.  The action taken by the accused must be with an intent to influence judicial or grand jury proceedings;  it is not enough that there be an intent to influence some ancillary proceeding, such as an investigation independent of the Court\\'s or grand jury\\'s authority.  United States v. Brown, 688 F.2d 596, 598 (CA9 1982) (citing cases).  Some courts have phrased this showing as a \"nexus\" requirement—that the act must have a relationship in time, causation or logic with the judicial proceedings.  United States v. Wood, 6 F.3d 692, 696 (CA10 1993);  United States v. Walasek, 527 F.2d 676, 679, and n. 12 (CA3 1975).  In other words, the endeavor must have the \" \\'natural and probable effect\\' \" of interfering with the due administration of justice.  Wood, supra, at 695;  United States v. Thomas, 916 F.2d 647, 651 (CA11 1990); Walasek, supra, at 679.  This is not to say that the defendant\\'s actions need be successful;  an \"endeavor\" suffices.  United States v. Russell, 255 U.S. 138, 143, 41 S.Ct. 260, 261, 65 L.Ed. 553 (1921).  But as in Pettibone, if the defendant lacks knowledge that his actions are likely to affect the judicial proceeding, he lacks the requisite intent to obstruct.\\n\\n\\n11\\nAlthough respondent urges various broader grounds for affirmance,1 we find it unnecessary to address them because we think the \"nexus\" requirement developed in the decisions of the courts of appeals is a correct construction of § 1503.  We have traditionally exercised restraint in assessing the reach of a federal criminal statute, both out of deference to the prerogatives of Congress, Dowling v. United States, 473 U.S. 207, 105 S.Ct. 3127, 87 L.Ed.2d 152 (1985), and out of concern that \"a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed,\" McBoyle v. United States, 283 U.S. 25, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340, 341, 75 L.Ed. 816 (1931).  We do not believe that uttering false statements to an investigating agent—and that seems to be all that was proven here—who might or might not testify before a grand jury is sufficient to make out a violation of the catchall provision of § 1503.\\n\\n\\n12\\nThe Government did not show here that the agents acted as an arm of the grand jury, or indeed that the grand jury had even summoned the testimony of these particular agents.  The Government argues that respondent \"understood that his false statements would be provided to the grand jury\" and that he made the statements with the intent to thwart the grand jury investigation and not just the FBI investigation.  Brief for United States 18.  The Government supports its argument with a citation to the transcript of the recorded conversation between Aguilar and the FBI agent at the point where Aguilar asks whether he is a target of a grand jury investigation.  The agent responded to the question by stating:\\n\\n\\n13\\n\"[T]here is a Grand Jury meeting.  Convening I guess that\\'s      the correct word.  Um some evidence will be heard I\\'m . . .      I\\'m sure on this issue.\"  App. 86.\\n\\n\\n14\\nBecause respondent knew of the pending proceeding, the Government therefore contends that Aguilar\\'s statements are analogous to those made directly to the grand jury itself, in the form of false testimony or false documents.2\\n\\n\\n15\\nWe think the transcript citation relied upon by the Government would not enable a rational trier of fact to conclude that respondent knew that his false statement would be provided to the grand jury, and that the evidence goes no further than showing that respondent testified falsely to an investigating agent.  Such conduct, we believe, falls on the other side of the statutory line from that of one who delivers false documents or testimony to the grand jury itself.  Conduct of the latter sort all but assures that the grand jury will consider the material in its deliberations.  But what use will be made of false testimony given to an investigating agent who has not been subpoenaed or otherwise directed to appear before the grand jury is far more speculative. We think it cannot be said to have the \"natural and probable effect\" of interfering with the due administration of justice.\\n\\n\\n16\\nJustice SCALIA\\'s dissent criticizes our treatment of the statutory language for reading the word \"endeavor\" out of it, inasmuch as it excludes defendants who have an evil purpose but use means that would \"only unnaturally and improbably be successful.\"  Post, at ____. This criticism is unwarranted.  Our reading of the statute gives the term \"endeavor\" a useful function to fulfill:  it makes conduct punishable where the defendant acts with an intent to obstruct justice, and in a manner that is likely to obstruct justice, but is foiled in some way.  Were a defendant with the requisite intent to lie to a subpoenaed witness who is ultimately not called to testify, or who testifies but does not transmit the defendant\\'s version of the story, the defendant has endeavored to, but has not actually, obstructed justice.  Under our approach, a jury could find such defendant guilty.\\n\\n\\n17\\nJustice SCALIA\\'s dissent also apparently believes that any act, done with the intent to \"obstruct . . . the due administration of justice,\" is sufficient to impose criminal liability.  Under the dissent\\'s theory, a man could be found guilty under § 1503 if he knew of a pending investigation and lied to his wife about his whereabouts at the time of the crime, thinking that an FBI agent might decide to interview her and that she might in turn be influenced in her statement to the agent by her husband\\'s false account of his whereabouts.  The intent to obstruct justice is indeed present, but the man\\'s culpability is a good deal less clear from the statute than we usually require in order to impose criminal liability.\\n\\nII\\n\\n18\\nSection 2232(c) prohibits the disclosure of information that a wiretap has been sought or authorized.  The statute reads:\\n\\n\\n19\\n\"Whoever, having knowledge that a Federal investigative or      law enforcement officer has been authorized or has applied      for authorization under chapter 119 to intercept a wire,      oral, or electronic communication, in order to obstruct,      impede, or prevent such interception, gives notice or      attempts to give notice of the possible interception to any      person shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more      than five years, or both.\"  18 U.S.C. § 2232(c).\\n\\n\\n20\\nThis section is much more precisely targeted than is the catchall provision of § 1503 discussed above.  The first clause defines the element of knowledge required for the act to be criminal:  knowledge that an officer has been authorized or has sought authorization to intercept a communication.  The second clause defines the required intent with which the act be done: \"in order to obstruct, impede, or prevent such interception.\"  The third clause defines the punishable act:  \"gives notice or attempts to give notice of the possible interception.\"  Respondent persuaded the Court of Appeals to hold that the wiretap application or authorization must be pending or in esse at the time of the disclosure, but we do not believe any such requirement is to be found in the statutory language.\\n\\n\\n21\\nRespondent here urges the reasoning accepted by the Court of Appeals.  \"[T]he purpose of the statute is to prevent interference with \\'possible interception.\\' \"  21 F.3d, at 1480.  Once a wiretap has expired or been denied, the Ninth Circuit reasoned, there is no \" \\'possible interception\\' \" to disclose or attempt to disclose.  Ibid.  The narrow purpose of the statute is further evidenced by the statute\\'s intent requirement, which limits punishable disclosures to those undertaken with the intent to interfere with \" \\'such interception\\' \" of which the defendant \"has knowledge.\"  Ibid.  Under the circumstances, the disclosure of an expired wiretap not only fails to violate the terms of the statute, it fails to implicate any interest protected by § 2232(c).  Brief for Respondent 38.\\n\\n\\n22\\nBut this argument, we think, fails in the face of the statutory language itself.  The term \"such interception\" is part of the intent requirement in the second clause;  the defendant must intend to obstruct the interception made pursuant to the application or authorization of which he has the knowledge required by the first clause.  The phrase \"possible interception\" is found in the third clause, which describes the act which offends the statute.  A defendant intending to disclose the existence of a pending application would ordinarily have no way of knowing whether the application or authorization had resulted in an interception, and that is doubtless why the third clause uses the term \"possible\" interception.  It was not intended to limit the offense to cases where the interception based upon the application or authorization was factually possible, but to recognize the fact that at the time the prohibited notice was given it very likely could not be known whether or not there would be an interception.\\n\\n\\n23\\nThe Court of Appeals thought its result justified by its view that the aim of the statute was to prevent interference with \"possible\" interceptions, and that if an interception was not possible because the wiretap was no longer in place at the time of the disclosure, that interest was not threatened.  But the statute is aimed at something more than the interference with interceptions;  it is aimed at disclosure of wiretap orders or applications which may lead to interceptions.  The offense is complete at the time the notice is given, when it often cannot be known whether any interception will take place.\\n\\n\\n24\\nJustice STEVENS argues that § 2232(c) criminalizes disclosures of pending applications without a need to rely on the word \"possible.\"  Post, at ____. That is not so.  The reference to pending applications occurs only in the clause specifying the knowledge element.  The actus reus element must be independently satisfied.  Without the word \"possible,\" the statute would only prohibit giving notice of \"the interception\":  It would not reach the giving of notice of an application which has not yet resulted in an authorization or an authorization which has not yet resulted in an interception.  That Congress could have accomplished the same result by phrasing the statute differently—for instance, by repeating \"such interception\" in the third clause, post, at ____ does not undercut the fact that the word possible is necessary in the statute as written to criminalize such behavior.3\\n\\n\\n25\\nAcceptance of respondent\\'s position would open the door to additional claims of \"impossibility\" other than the fact that the application or order was not pending at the time of the disclosure.  Some sort of mechanical failure, or the departure of the person whose conversation was to be intercepted from the place at which the reception was authorized, are two which come to mind. In Osborn v. United States, 385 U.S. 323, 333, 87 S.Ct. 429, 435, 17 L.Ed.2d 394 (1966), we expressed reservations about the \"continuing validity [of] the doctrine of \\'impossibility,\\' with all its subtleties,\" in the law of criminal attempt, and we would require much more than the statutory language before us to believe that Congress intended to engraft it onto the language of § 2232(c).\\n\\n\\n26\\nFinally, respondent urges us to read the statute to exclude disclosures of expired wiretaps because of concern that a broader construction would run counter to the First Amendment.  We see no necessity for such a restrictive construction of the statute.  It is true that the government may not generally restrict individuals from disclosing information that lawfully comes into their hands in the absence of a \"state interest of the highest order,\" Smith v. Daily Mail Publishing Co., 443 U.S. 97, 103, 99 S.Ct. 2667, 2671, 61 L.Ed.2d 399 (1979).  But the statute here in question does not impose such a restriction generally, but only upon those who disclose wiretap information \"in order to instruct, impede, or prevent\" the interception.  Nor was the respondent simply a member of the general public who happened to lawfully acquire possession of information about the wiretap;  he was a federal district court judge who learned of a confidential wiretap application from the judge who had authorized the interception, and who wished to preserve the integrity of the court.  Government officials in sensitive confidential positions may have special duties of nondisclosure.  See Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 6(e) (prohibiting the disclosure of grand jury information).  Likewise, protective orders may be imposed in connection with information acquired through civil discovery without violating the First Amendment. Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart, 467 U.S. 20, 31, 104 S.Ct. 2199, 2206, 81 L.Ed.2d 17 (1984).  As to one who voluntarily assumed a duty of confidentiality, governmental restrictions on disclosure are not subject to the same stringent standards that would apply to efforts to impose restrictions on unwilling members of the public.  See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 100 S.Ct. 763, 62 L.Ed.2d 704 (1980) (per curiam ).  In this case, Chief Judge Peckham postponed the notification of parties named in the application in order to maintain the secrecy of the wiretap.  See 18 U.S.C. § 2518(1)(d).  We think the Government\\'s interest is quite sufficient to justify the construction of the statute as written, without any artificial narrowing because of First Amendment concerns.\\n\\n\\n27\\nRespondent raised below a challenge to the jury instructions, but the Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to decide.  We affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals with respect to respondent\\'s conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1503 and reverse with respect to respondent\\'s conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 2232(c).  We remand for proceedings consistent with this decision.\\n\\n\\n28\\n\\nSo ordered.\\n\\n\\n\\n29\\nJustice STEVENS, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\\n\\n\\n30\\nAlthough I agree with the Court\\'s disposition of the § 1503 issue, and also with its rejection of the First Amendment challenge to respondent\\'s conviction for disclosing a wiretap application under § 2232(c), I believe the Court of Appeals correctly construed § 2232(c) to invalidate respondent\\'s conviction under that statute.\\n\\n\\n31\\nWhen respondent was convicted of disclosing a 30-day wiretap authorization that had expired months before the disclosure, he was convicted of an attempt to do the impossible:  interfere with a nonexistent wiretap.  Traditionally, the law does not proscribe an attempt unless the defendant\\'s intent is accompanied by \"a dangerous probability that [the unlawful result] will happen.\" Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U.S. 375, 396, 25 S.Ct. 276, 279, 49 L.Ed. 518 (1905) (Holmes, J.).  Whether such a dangerous probability exists, of course, depends ultimately on what result we interpret the statute as having declared unlawful.  See 2 W. LaFave & A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law § 6.3, pp. 44-45 (1986).  In this case, there was no dangerous probability that respondent actually would reveal the existence of a wiretap or wiretap application because none existed to reveal.  We should abjure a construction of a criminal statute that leads to criminalizing nothing more than an evil intent accompanied by a harmless act, particularly when, as here, the statutory language does not clearly extend liability so far.  Cf. Simpson v. United States, 435 U.S. 6, 14-15, 98 S.Ct. 909, 914, 55 L.Ed.2d 70 (1978).\\n\\n\\n32\\nIndeed, the text of § 2232(c) favors a reading that requires, as an essential element of the offense, the possibility of interference with an authorized interception.  Both the second and third clauses of the statute support this straightforward interpretation.  The second clause requires that the defendant intend to impede \"such interception.\"  That phrase refers to an interception that the defendant knows a federal officer \"has been authorized or has applied for authorization\" to make.  After the authorization expires, no \"such interception\" can occur. Moreover, to infer that \"such interception\" includes any interception that might be made pursuant to any subsequent reauthorization severely undermines the statute\\'s knowledge requirement by making actual knowledge of an initial, limited authorization the linchpin of liability for disclosing later, entirely conjectural or nonexistent authorizations.  That inference contradicts our usual practice of giving strict effect to scienter provisions.  See, e.g., United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. 464, 467-470, 130 L.Ed.2d 372 (1994).\\n\\n\\n33\\nThe third clause of § 2232(c) describes the notice that a defendant must attempt to give a third person in order to violate the statute as notice of \"the possible interception.\"  The definite article necessarily refers to an interception that is \"authorized\" (or for which federal officers have applied for authorization) per the second clause, thereby imposing authorization as a requirement to satisfy the next word, \"possible.\"  I agree with the Court that interceptions prevented by mechanical failures or the departure of the suspect are \"possible\" within the meaning of the statute, see ante, at ____, as long as those interceptions, however unlikely, are legally \"authorized.\"  The wholly theoretical interception that respondent was convicted of attempting to impede was not authorized, nor had federal officers even sought authorization for it;  therefore, it was not \"possible\" within the meaning of the statute.\\n\\n\\n34\\nThe Court\\'s attempt to explain the word \"possible\" as an assurance that the statute will cover interceptions that may or may not result from a pending application, see ante, at ____, is unpersuasive.  Because the statute plainly criminalizes disclosures of pending applications, \"possible\" does not need to do the work the Court assigns it.  The phrase \"such interception,\" already used in the second clause, would do just as well.  The function of \"possible\" must be to place some temporal limitation on potential liability under the statute.  Under the Court\\'s reasoning, respondent could be found guilty if he had disclosed a 10-year-old application or authorization.  The word \"possible,\" properly understood, would prevent such an absurd result by limiting liability to interceptions that could actually be made pursuant to present or pending authorization.\\n\\n\\n35\\nAs the Court notes in response to this dissent, see ante, at ____, under its reading the third clause serves to define the actus reus element of the crime, just as Congress could have done by replacing the phrase \"notice of the possible interception\" with the unambiguous phrase \"notice of such authorization or application.\"  That unambiguous language, however, would not achieve the temporal limitation on liability that I believe Congress intended to achieve with the words \"possible interception.\"  The Court appears to acknowledge the need for such a limitation.  See ante, at ____, n. 3.  Rather than recognizing the limitation the statute contains, however, the Court hints that it might in some future case invent one.  Limiting liability to the time before the authorizing judge announces the wiretap may well be \"plausible,\" ibid., but no plausible basis exists for finding that limitation in the words of the statute.  A wiser course than judicial legislation, I submit, is simply to adopt a literal, reasonable construction of the text that Congress drafted.\\n\\n\\n36\\nI would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals in its entirety.\\n\\n\\n37\\nJustice SCALIA, with whom Justice KENNEDY and Justice THOMAS join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\\n\\n\\n38\\nI join all but Part I and the last paragraph of Part II of the Court\\'s opinion.  I would reverse the Court of Appeals, and would uphold respondent\\'s conviction, on the count charging violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1503.\\n\\n\\n39\\n* The \"omnibus clause\" of § 1503, under which respondent was charged, provides:\\n\\n\\n40\\n\"Whoever . . . corruptly or by threats or force, or by      any threatening letter or communication, influences,      obstructs, or impedes, or endeavors to influence, obstruct,      or impede, the due administration of justice, shall be fined      not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years,      or both.\"  18 U.S.C. § 1503 (1988 Ed.).\\n\\n\\n41\\nThis makes criminal not just success in corruptly influencing the due administration of justice, but also the \"endeavor\" to do so.  We have given this latter proscription, which respondent was specifically charged with violating, see App. 106-107, a generous reading:  \"The word of the section is \\'endeavor,\\' and by using it the section got rid of the technicalities which might be urged as besetting the word \\'attempt,\\' and it describes any effort or essay to accomplish the evil purpose that the section was enacted to prevent.\"  United States v. Russell, 255 U.S. 138, 143, 41 S.Ct. 260, 261, 65 L.Ed. 553 (1921) (emphasis added) (interpreting substantially identical predecessor statute).  Under this reading of the statute, it is even immaterial whether the endeavor to obstruct pending proceedings is possible of accomplishment.  In Osborn v. United States, 385 U.S. 323, 333, 87 S.Ct. 429, 435, 17 L.Ed.2d 394 (1966), we dismissed out of hand the \"impossibility\" defense of a defendant who had sought to convey a bribe to a prospective juror through an intermediary who was secretly working for the government.  \"Whatever continuing validity,\" we said, \"the doctrine of \\'impossibility\\' . . . may continue to have in the law of criminal attempt, that body of law is inapplicable here.\" Ibid.  (footnote omitted).1\\n\\n\\n42\\nEven read at its broadest, however, § 1503\\'s prohibition of \"endeavors\" to impede justice is not without limits.  To \"endeavor\" means to strive or work for a certain end.  Webster\\'s New International Dictionary 844 (2d ed. 1950);  1 New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 816 (1993).  Thus, § 1503 reaches only purposeful efforts to obstruct the due administration of justice, i.e., acts performed with that very object in mind.  See, e.g., United States v. Mullins, 22 F.3d 1365, 1370 (CA6 1994);  United States v. Ryan, 455 F.2d 728, 734 (CA9 1972).  This limitation was clearly set forth in our first decision construing § 1503\\'s predecessor statute, Pettibone v. United States, 148 U.S. 197, 13 S.Ct. 542, 37 L.Ed. 419 (1893), which held an indictment insufficient because it had failed to allege the intent to obstruct justice.  That opinion rejected the Government\\'s contention that the intent required to violate the statute could be found in \"the intent to commit an unlawful act, in the doing of which justice was in fact obstructed\";  to justify a conviction, it said, \"the specific intent to violate the statute must exist.\" Id., at 207, 13 S.Ct. at 547.  Pettibone did acknowledge, however and here is the point that is distorted to produce today\\'s opinion that the specific intent to obstruct justice could be found where the defendant intentionally committed a wrongful act that had obstruction of justice as its \"natural and probable consequence.\" Ibid.\\n\\n\\n43\\nToday\\'s \"nexus\" requirement sounds like this, but is in reality quite different.  Instead of reaffirming that \"natural and probable consequence\" is one way of establishing intent, it substitutes \" \\' \"natural and probable effect\" \\' \" for intent, requiring that factor even when intent to obstruct justice is otherwise clear.  See ante, at ____, quoting United States v. Wood, 6 F.3d 692, 695 (CA10 1993), which in turn quotes United States v. Thomas, 916 F.2d 647, 651 (CA11 1990).2  But while it is quite proper to derive an intent requirement from § 1503\\'s use of the word \"endeavor,\" it is quite impossible to derive a \"natural and probable consequence \" requirement.  One would be \"endeavoring\" to obstruct justice if he intentionally set out to do it by means that would only unnaturally and improbably be successful.  As we said in Russell, \"any effort or essay\" corruptly to influence, obstruct, or impede the due administration of justice constitutes a forbidden endeavor, 255 U.S., at 143, 41 S.Ct., at 261, even, as we held in Osborn, an effort that is incapable of having that effect, see 385 U.S., at 333, 87 S.Ct., at 435.\\n\\n\\n44\\nThe Court does not indicate where its \"nexus\" requirement is to be found in the words of the statute.  Instead, it justifies its holding with the assertion that \"[w]e have traditionally exercised restraint in assessing the reach of a federal criminal statute, both out of deference to the prerogatives of Congress and out of concern that a fair warning should be given . . . of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.\"  Ante, at ____ (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  But \"exercising restraint in assessing the reach of a federal criminal statute\" (which is what the rule of lenity requires, see United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 347-348, 92 S.Ct. 515, 522, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971)) is quite different from importing extratextual requirements in order to limit the reach of a federal criminal statute, which is what the Court has done here.  By limiting § 1503 to acts having the \"natural and probable effect\" of interfering with the due administration of justice, the Court effectively reads the word \"endeavor,\" which we said in Russell embraced \"any effort or essay\" to obstruct justice, 255 U.S., at 143, 41 S.Ct., at 261, out of the omnibus clause, leaving a prohibition of only actual obstruction and competent attempts.\\n\\nII\\n\\n45\\nThe Court apparently adds to its \"natural and probable effect\" requirement the requirement that the defendant know of that natural and probable effect.  See ante, at ____ (\"[I]f the defendant lacks knowledge that his actions are likely to affect the judicial proceeding, he lacks the requisite intent to obstruct\").  Separate proof of such knowledge is not, I think, required for the orthodox use of the \"natural and probable effect\" rule discussed in Pettibone:  Where the defendant intentionally commits a wrongful act that in fact has the \"natural and probable consequence\" of obstructing justice, \"the unintended wrong may derive its character from the wrong that was intended.\"  148 U.S., at 207, 13 S.Ct., at 547.  Or, as we would put the point in modern times, the jury is entitled to presume that a person intends the natural and probable consequences of his acts.\\n\\n\\n46\\nWhile inquiry into the state of the defendant\\'s knowledge seems quite superfluous to the Court\\'s opinion (since the act performed did not have the requisite \"natural and probable effect\" anyway), it is necessary to my disposition of the case.  As I have said, I think an act committed with intent to obstruct is all that matters;  and what one can fairly be thought to have intended depends in part upon what one can fairly be thought to have known. The critical point of knowledge at issue, in my view, is not whether \"respondent knew that his false statement would be provided to the grand jury,\" ante, at ____ (emphasis added) (a heightened burden imposed by the Court\\'s knowledge-of-natural-and-probable-effect requirement), but rather whether respondent knew—or indeed, even erroneously believed —that his false statement might be provided to the grand jury (which is all the knowledge needed to support the conclusion that the purpose of his lie was to mislead the jury).  Applying the familiar standard of Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), to the proper question, I find that a rational juror could readily have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that respondent had corruptly endeavored to impede the due administration of justice, i.e., that he lied to the FBI agents intending to interfere with a grand jury investigation into his misdeeds.\\n\\n\\n47\\nRecorded conversations established that respondent knew a grand jury had been convened, App. 47;  that he had been told he was a target of its investigation, id., at 68;  and that he feared he would be unable to explain his actions if he were subpoenaed to testify, id., at 51.  Respondent himself testified that, at least at the conclusion of the interview, it was his \"impression\" that his statements to the FBI agents would be reported to the grand jury.  9 Tr. 1360 (Aug. 14, 1990).  The evidence further established that respondent made false statements to the FBI agents that minimized his involvement in the matters the grand jury was investigating.  See App. 73, 76, 81, 83-84, 86.  Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, I am simply unable to conclude that no rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that respondent lied specifically because he thought the agents might convey what he said to the grand jury—which suffices to constitute a corrupt endeavor to impede the due administration of justice.  In fact, I think it would be hard for a juror to conclude otherwise.\\n\\nIII\\n\\n48\\nSince I find against respondent on the § 1503 count, I must consider several other grounds offered by respondent for affirming the Court of Appeals\\' setting aside of his conviction.  First, invoking the interpretive canon of ejusdem generis, he argues that, since all the rest of § 1503 refers only to actions directed at jurors and court officers,3 the omnibus clause cannot apply to actions directed at witnesses.  But the rule of ejusdem generis, which \"limits general terms which follow specific ones to matters similar to those specified,\" Gooch v. United States, 297 U.S. 124, 128, 56 S.Ct. 395, 397, 80 L.Ed. 522 (1936);  accord Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U.S. 578, 588, 100 S.Ct. 1889, 1895, 64 L.Ed.2d 525 (1980), has no application here.  Although something of a catch-all, the omnibus clause is not a general or collective term following a list of specific items to which a particular statutory command is applicable (e.g., \"fishing rods, nets, hooks, bobbers, sinkers, and other equipment\").  Rather, it is one of the several distinct and independent prohibitions contained in § 1503 that share only the word \"Whoever,\" which begins the statute, and the penalty provision which ends it.  Indeed, given the already broad terms of the other clauses in § 1503, to limit the omnibus clause in the manner respondent urges would render it superfluous. See United States v. Howard, 569 F.2d 1331, 1333 (CA5 1978).\\n\\n\\n49\\nRespondent next contends that because Congress in 1982 enacted a different statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1512, dealing with witness tampering, and simultaneously removed from § 1503 the provisions it had previously contained specifically addressing efforts to influence or injure witnesses, see Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982, Pub.L. 97-291, 96 Stat. 1249-1250, 1253, his witness-related conduct is no longer punishable under the omnibus clause of § 1503.  The 1982 amendment, however, did nothing to alter the omnibus clause, which by its terms encompasses corrupt \"endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice.\"  The fact that there is now some overlap between § 1503 and § 1512 is no more intolerable than the fact that there is some overlap between the omnibus clause of § 1503 and the other provisions of § 1503 itself.  It hardly leads to the conclusion that § 1503 was, to the extent of the overlap, silently repealed.  It is not unusual for a particular act to violate more than one criminal statute, see, e.g., Gavieres v. United States, 220 U.S. 338, 342, 31 S.Ct. 421, 422, 55 L.Ed. 489 (1911), and in such situations the Government may proceed under any statute that applies, see, e.g., United States v. Batchelder, 442 U.S. 114, 123-124, 99 S.Ct. 2198, 2204, 60 L.Ed.2d 755 (1979); United States v. Beacon Brass Co., 344 U.S. 43, 45-46, 73 S.Ct. 77, 78-79, 97 L.Ed. 61 (1952).  It is, moreover, \"a cardinal principle of statutory construction that repeals by implication are not favored.\"  United States v. United Continental Tuna Corp., 425 U.S. 164, 168, 96 S.Ct. 1319, 1323, 47 L.Ed.2d 653 (1976);  see also Posadas v. National City Bank, 296 U.S. 497, 503, 56 S.Ct. 349, 352, 80 L.Ed. 351 (1936).\\n\\n\\n50\\nFinally, respondent posits that the phrase \" \\'corruptly . . . endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede\\' \" \"may be unconstitutionally vague,\" in that it fails to provide sufficient notice that lying to potential grand jury witnesses in an effort to thwart a grand jury investigation is proscribed.  Brief for Respondent 22, n. 13.  Statutory language need not be colloquial, however, and the term \"corruptly\" in criminal laws has a long-standing and well-accepted meaning.  It denotes \"[a]n act done with an intent to give some advantage inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others. . . .  It includes bribery but is more comprehensive;  because an act may be corruptly done though the advantage to be derived from it be not offered by another.\"  United States v. Ogle, 613 F.2d 233, 238 (CA10) (internal quotation marks omitted), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 825, 101 S.Ct. 87, 66 L.Ed.2d 28 (1980).  See also Ballentine\\'s Law Dictionary 276 (3d ed. 1969);  Black\\'s Law Dictionary 345 (6th ed. 1990).  As the District Court here instructed the jury:\\n\\n\\n51\\n\"An act is done corruptly if it\\'s done voluntarily and      intentionally to bring about either an unlawful result or a      lawful result by some unlawful method, with a hope or      expectation of either financial gain or other benefit to      oneself or a benefit of another person.\"  App. 117.\\n\\n\\n52\\nMoreover, in the context of obstructing jury proceedings, any claim of ignorance of wrongdoing is incredible.  Acts specifically intended to \"influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice\" are obviously wrongful, just as they are necessarily \"corrupt.\"  See Ogle, supra, at 239;  United States v. North, 910 F.2d 843, 941 (Silberman, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), modified, 920 F.2d 940 (CADC 1990); United States v. Reeves, 752 F.2d 995, 999 (CA5), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 834, 106 S.Ct. 107, 88 L.Ed.2d 87 (1985).\\n\\n\\n53\\n*   *   *\\n\\n\\n54\\nThe \"nexus\" requirement that the Court today engrafts into § 1503 has no basis in the words Congress enacted.  I would reverse that part of the Court of Appeals\\' judgment which set aside respondent\\'s conviction under that statute.\\n\\n\\n\\n*\\n The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.  See United States v. Detroit Lumber Co., 200 U.S. 321, 337, 26 S.Ct. 282, 287, 50 L.Ed. 499.\\n\\n\\n1\\n Respondent argues that the term \"corruptly\" is vague and overbroad as applied to the type of conduct at issue in this case and that Congress narrowed the scope of the omnibus clause when it expressly punished his conduct in 18 U.S.C. § 1512.\\n\\n\\n2\\n See, e.g., United States v. Mullins, 22 F.3d 1365, 1367-1368 (CA6 1994) (altered records and instructed co-worker to alter records subject to subpoena duces tecum );  United States v. Williams, 874 F.2d 968, 976-982 (CA5 1989) (uttered false testimony to grand jury);  United States v. McComb, 744 F.2d 555, 559 (CA7 1984) (created false meeting minutes and voluntarily delivered them to grand jury);  United States v. Faudman, 640 F.2d 20, 23 (CA6 1981) (falsified records, some of which had been sought by subpoena duces tecum );  United States v. Walasek, 527 F.2d 676, 679-680 (CA3 1975) (falsified documents requested by subpoena duces tecum ).\\n\\n\\n3\\n Justice STEVENS also argues that our reading of the statute would achieve no temporal limitation on liability and could result in the \"absurd\" prosecution of a discloser 10 years after the wiretap expired.  Post, at ____. Although we reserve the question for a case that presents it, we note that the wiretapping scheme as a whole suggests that a plausible temporal limit on liability for disclosure would be the point at which the authorizing judge notifies the interceptee and related parties of the existence of an application or authorization pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2518(8)(d).  Such notification must occur \"within a reasonable time\" after denial of the application or termination of a wiretap, and may be postponed only upon a showing of \"good cause.\"  18 U.S.C. § 2518(8)(d).  The parties did not brief this issue and we need not decide it on these facts because respondent disclosed his knowledge of the wiretap application before Chief Judge Peckham notified the parties in May, 1989.  That notification issued two years after the FBI first applied for authorization and one year after the last authorized wiretap expired.\\n\\n\\n1\\n This complete disavowal of the impossibility defense may be excessive.  As Pettibone v. United States, 148 U.S. 197, 13 S.Ct. 542, 37 L.Ed. 419 (1893) acknowledged, an endeavor to obstruct proceedings that did not exist would not violate the statute.  \"[O]bstruction can only arise when justice is being administered.\"  Id., at 207, 13 S.Ct., at 546.  See, e.g., United States v. Williams, 874 F.2d 968, 977 (CA5 1989) (\"There are three core elements that the government must establish . . .:  (1) there must be a pending judicial proceeding\").\\n\\n\\n2\\n Thomas, which appears to be the origin of this doctrine, made precisely the same mistake the Court does.  It cited and misapplied earlier Court of Appeals cases standing for the entirely different principle—flowing from our language in Pettibone—that to prove an \"endeavor\" to obstruct justice, \"all the government has to establish is that the defendant should have reasonably foreseen that the natural and probable consequence of the success of his scheme would [obstruct the due administration of justice].\"  United States v. Silverman, 745 F.2d 1386, 1393 (CA11 1984).  See also United States v. Fields, 838 F.2d 1571, 1573 (CA11 1988).  This does not impose a requirement of \"natural and probable consequence,\" but approves a manner of proof of \"intent.\"  See, e.g., United States v. Neiswender, 590 F.2d 1269, 1273 (CA4), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 963, 99 S.Ct. 2410, 60 L.Ed.2d 1068 (1979).\\n\\n\\n3\\n Those clauses provide:\\n\"Whoever corruptly, or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication, endeavors to influence, intimidate, or impede any grand or petit juror, or officer in or of any court of the United States, or officer who may be serving at any examination or other proceeding before any United States commissioner or other committing magistrate, in the discharge of his duty, or injures any such grand or petit juror in his person or property on account of any verdict or indictment assented to by him, or on account of his being or having been such juror, or injures any such officer, commissioner, or other committing magistrate in his person or property on account of the performance of his official duties . . . shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\"  18 U.S.C. § 1503 (1988 ed.).\\n\\n\\n'}]\n",

He is a twenty-four-year-old first offender who is a successful music executive with two young children. Because he was convicted of dealing marijuana and related offenses, both the government and the defense agree that Mr. Angelos should serve about six to eight years in prison. But there are three additional firearms offenses for which the court must also impose sentence. Two of those offenses occurred when Mr. Angelos earned a handgun to two $350 marijuana deals; the third when police found several additional handguns at his home when they executed a search warrant. For these three acts of possessing (not using or even displaying) these guns, the government insists that Mr. Angelos should essentially spend the rest of his life in prison. Specifically, the government urges the court to sentence Mr. Angelos to a prison term of no less than 61½ years\\x97 six years and a half (or more) for drug dealing followed by 55 years for three counts of possessing a firearm in connection with a drug offense. In support of its position, the government relies on a statute\\x9718U.S.C. § 924(c)\\x97which requires the court to impose a sentence of five years in prison the first time a drug dealer carries a gun and twenty-five years for each subsequent time. Under § 924(c), the three counts produce 55 years of additional punishment for carrying a firearm.\\nThe court believes that to sentence Mr. Angelos to prison for the rest of his life is unjust, cruel, and even irrational. Adding 55 years on top of a sentence for drug dealing is far beyond the roughly two-year sentence that the congressionally-created expert agency (the United States Sentencing Commission) believes is appropriate for possessing firearms under the same circumstances. The 55-year sentence substantially exceeds what the jury recommended to the court. It is also far in excess of the sentence imposed for such serious crimes as aircraft hijacking, second degree murder, espionage, kidnapping, aggravated assault, and rape. It exceeds what recidivist criminals will likely serve under the federal \"three strikes\" provision. At the same time, however, this 55-year additional sentence is decreed by § 924(c).\\nThe court\\'s role in evaluating § 924(c) is quite limited. The court can set aside the statute only if it is irrational punishment without any conceivable justification or is so excessive as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. After careful deliberation, the court reluctantly concludes that it has no choice but to impose the 55 year sentence. While the sentence appears to be cruel, unjust, and irrational, in our system of separated powers Congress makes the final decisions as to appropriate criminal penalties. Under the controlling case law, the court must find either that a statute has no conceivable justification or is so grossly disproportionate to the crime that no reasonable argument can be made its behalf. If the court is to fairly apply these precedents in this case, it must reject Mr. Angelos\\' constitutional challenges. Accordingly, the court sentences Mr. Angelos to a prison term of 55 years and one day, the minimum that the law allows.\\nTo correct what appears to be an unjust sentence, the court also calls on the President\\x97in whom our Constitution reposes the power to correct unduly harsh sentences\\x97tocommute Mr. Angelos\\' sentence to something that is more in accord with just and rational punishment. In particular, the court recommends that the Presidddent *1231 commute Mr. Angelos\\' sentence to no more than 18 years in prison, the average sentence that the jurors in this case recommended. In addition, the court also calls on Congress to modify § 924(c) so that its harsh provisions for 25-year multiple sentences apply only to true recidivist drug offenders\\x97those who have been sent to prison and failed to learn their lesson. Because of the complexity of these conclusions, the court will set out their basis at some length.\\n\\nI. Factual Background\\nWeldon Angelos is twenty-four years old. He was born on July 16, 1979, in Salt Lake City, Utah. He was raised in the Salt Lake City area by his father, Mr. James B. Angelos, with only minimal contact with his mother. Mr. Angelos has two young children by Ms. Zandrah Uyan: six-year-old Anthony and five-year-old Jessie. Before his arrest Mr. Angelos had achieved some success in the music industry. He started Extravagant Records, a label that produces rap and hip hop music. He had woi\\'ked with prominent hip hop musicians, including Snoop Dogg, on the \"beats\" to various songs and was preparing to record his own album.\\nThe critical events in this case are three \"controlled buys\" of marijuana by a government informant from Mr. Angelos. On May 10, 2002, Mr. Angelos met with the informant, Ronnie Lazalde, and arranged a sale of marijuana. On May 21, 2002, Mr. Angelos completed a sale of a eight ounces of marijuana to Lazalde for $350. Lazalde observed Mr. Angelos\\' Glock pistol by the center console of his car. This drug deal formed the basis for the first § 924(c) count.\\nDuring a second controlled buy with Lazalde, on June 4, 2002, Mr. Angelos lifted his pant leg to show him the Glock in an ankle holster. Lazalde again purchased approximately eight ounces of marijuana for $350. This deal formed the basis for the second § 924(c) count.\\nA third controlled buy occurred on June 18, 2002, with Mr. Angelos again selling Lazalde eight ounces of marijuana for $350. There was no direct evidence of a gun at this transaction, so no § 924(c) count was charged.\\nOn November 15, 2003, police officers arrested Mr. Angelos at his apartment pursuant to a warrant. Mr. Angelos consented to a search. The search revealed a briefcase which contained $18,040, a handgun, and two opiate suckers. Officers also discovered two bags which contained approximately three pounds of marijuana. Officers also recovered two other guns in a locked safe, one of which was confirmed as stolen. Searches at other locations, including the apartment of Mr. Angelos\\' girlfriend, turned up several duffle bags with marijuana residue, two more guns, and additional cash.\\nThe original indictment issued against Mr. Angelos contained three counts of distribution of marijuana,[1] one § 924(c) count for the firearm at the first controlled buy, and two other lesser charges. Plea negotiations began between the government and Mr. Angelos. On January 20, 2003, the government told Mr. Angelos, through counsel, that if he pled guilty to the drug distribution count and the § 924(c) count, the government would agree to drop all other charges, not supersede the indictment with additional counts, and recommend a prison sentence of 15 years. The government made clear to Mr. Angelos that if he rejected the offer, the government would obtain a new superseding indictment adding several § 924(c) counts that could lead to Mr. Angelos facing more than 100 years of mandatory prison time. *1232 In short, Mr. Angelos faced the choice of accepting 15 years in prison or insisting on a trial by jury at the risk of a life sentence. Ultimately, Mr. Angelos rejected the offer and decided to go to trial. The government then obtained two superseding indictments, eventually charging twenty total counts, including five § 924(c) counts which alone carried a potential minimum mandatory sentence of 105 years. The five § 924(c) counts consisted of two counts for the Glock seen at the two controlled buys, one count for three handguns found at his home, and two more counts for the two guns found at the home of Mr. Angelos\\' girlfriend.\\nPerhaps recognizing the gravity of the situation, Mr. Angelos tried to reopen plea negotiations, offering to plea to one count of drug distribution, one § 924(c) count, and one money laundering count. The government refused his offer, and the case proceeded to trial. The jury found Mr. Angelos guilty on sixteen counts, including three § 924(c) counts: two counts for the Glock seen at the two controlled buys and a third count for the three handguns at Mr. Angelos\\' home. The jury found him not guilty on three counts\\x97including the two additional § 924(c) counts for the two guns at his girlfriends\\' home. (The court dismissed one other minor count.)\\nMr. Angelos\\' sentence is presumptively governed by the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. Under governing Guideline provisions, the bottom line is that all counts but the three § 924(c) counts combine to create a total offense level of 28.[2] Because Mr. Angelos has no significant prior criminal history, he is treated as first-time offender (a criminal history category I) under the Guidelines. The prescribed Guidelines\\' sentence for Mr. Angelos for everything but the § 924(c) counts is 78 to 97 months.\\nAfter the Guideline sentence is imposed, however, the court must then add the § 924(c) counts. Section 924(c) prescribes a five-year mandatory minimum for a first conviction, and 25 years for each subsequent conviction.[3] This means that Mr. Angelos is facing 55 years (660 months) of mandatory time for the § 924(c) convictions. In addition, § 924(c) mandates that these 55 years run consecutively to any other time imposed.[4] As a consequence, the minimum sentence that the court can impose on Mr. Angelos is 61½ years\\x976½ years (78 months) for the 13 counts under the Guidelines and 55 consecutive years for the three § 924 convictions. The federal system does not provide the possibility of parole, but instead provides only a modest \"good behavior\" credit of approximately 15 percent of the sentence. Assuming good behavior, Mr. Angelos\\' sentence will be reduced to \"only\" 55 years, meaning he could be released when he is 78 years old.\\nMr. Angelos challenges this presumptive sentence on two grounds. His main argument is that § 924(c) is unconstitutional as applied to him, either because the additional 55-year sentence is irrational punishment that violates equal protection principles or is cruel and unusual punishment that violates the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause. His other argument is that the 78 to 97 month Guidelines sentence is unconstitutional under Blakely v. Washington[5] because a jury did not find the facts underlying the Guidelines calculation. The court will first address his constitutional challenges to § 924(c), then his challenge to the Guidelines sentence.\\n\\n\\n*1233 II. Legislative History and Judicial Interpretation of § 924(c)\\nBefore turning to Mr. Angelos\\' specific challenges to § 924(c), it is helpful to understand the history of the statute. Title 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) was proposed and enacted in a single day as an amendment to the Gun Control Act of 1968 enacted following the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. Congress intended the Act to address the \"increasing rate of crime and lawlessness and the growing use of firearms in violent crime.\"[6] Because § 924(c) was offered as a floor amendment, there are no congressional hearings or committee reports regarding its original purpose,[7] and the court is left only with a few statements made during floor debate.[8] For example, Representative Poff, the sponsor of the amendment, stated that the law\\'s purpose was to \"persuade the man tempted to commit a Federal felony to leave his gun at home.\"[9]\\nAs originally enacted, § 924(c) gave judges considerable discretion in sentencing and was not nearly as harsh as it has become. When passed in 1968, § 924(c) imposed an enhancement of \"not less than one year nor more than ten years\" for the person who \"uses a firearm to commit any felony for which he may be prosecuted in a court of the United States\" or \"carries a firearm unlawfully during the commission of any felony for which he may be prosecuted in a court of the United States.\" [10] If the person was convicted of a \"second or subsequent\" violation of § 924(c), the additional penalty was \"not less than 2 nor more than 25 years,\" which could not run \"concurrently with any term of imprisonment imposed for the commission of such felony.\" [11] In the 36 years since its passage, the penalties attached to § 924(c) have been made continually harsher either by judicial interpretation or congressional action.\\nOne of the first questions involving the provision was whether a defendant could be sentenced under § 924(c) where the underlying felony statute already included an enhancement for use of a firearm. In 1972 in Simpson v. United States,[12] the Supreme Court, relying on floor statements from Representative Poff, held that \"the purpose of § 924(c) is already served whenever the substantive federal offense provides enhanced punishment for the use of a dangerous weapon\" and that \"to construe the statute to allow the additional sentence authorized by § 924(c) to be pyramided upon a sentence already enhanced under § 2113(c) would violate the established rule that `ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.\\'\"[13] In 1980 in Busic v. United States,[14] the Court reaffirmed its decision in Simpson and went one step further, holding that prosecutors could not file a § 924(c) count instead of the enhancement provided for in the underlying *1234 federal statute. Supporting its conclusion, the Court noted that in 1971 the Department of Justice had advised prosecutors not to proceed under § 924(c) if the predicate felony statute provided for \"`increased penalties where a firearm was used in the commission of the offense.\\'\" [15]\\nIn response to Simpson and Busic, in 1984 Congress amended § 924(c) \"so that its sentencing enhancement would apply regardless of whether the underlying felony statute `provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device.\\'\" [16] The 1984 amendment also established a five-year mandatory minimum for use of a firearm during commission of a crime of violence.[17]\\nIn 1986, as part of the Firearms Owner\\'s Protection Act, Congress made § 924(c) specifically applicable to drug-trafficking crimes, and increased the mandatory minimum to ten years for certain types of firearms.[18] In later amendments, Congress increased the penalty for a \"second or subsequent\" § 924(c) conviction to a mandatory minimum of twenty years (then ultimately to twenty-five years).[19]\\nThe increased penalties for \"second or subsequent\" § 924(c) convictions produced litigation over whether multiple convictions in the same proceeding were subject to enhanced penalties. In essence, the issue was whether Congress intended § 924(c) to be a true recidivist statute or one that increased penalties for first offenders. Most courts, including the Tenth Circuit, did not apply the twenty-year penalty when the \"second\" conviction was just the second § 924(c) count in an indictment.[20] But in Deal v. United States,[21] the Supreme Court, in a six-to-three decision, construed the statute more broadly. In Deal, the defendant was convicted of committing six different bank robberies on six different dates, each time using a gun. He was sentenced to five years for the first § 924(c) charge, and twenty years for each of the other five § 924(c) charges\\x97a total of 105 years. In affirming his sentence, the Court held that a \"second or subsequent\" conviction could arise from a single prosecution.[22] To hold otherwise, the Court noted, would simply encourage prosecutors to file separate charges and try the defendant in separate prosecutions.[23]\\nLess than two weeks after Deal, the Court again interpreted the statute in Smith v. United States.[24] In Smith, the Court held that exchanging a gun for drugs constitutes \"use\" of a firearm \"during and in relation to ... [a] drug trafficking crime.\"[25] The Court rejected the defendant\\'s argument that \"use\" of a firearm required use as a weapon.[26] The majority *1235 noted than when Congress enacted the relevant version of § 924(c) it was no doubt responding to concerns that drugs and guns were a \"dangerous combination.\"[27] Justice Scalia argued in dissent that it was \"significant\" that the portion of § 924(c) relating to drug trafficking was affiliated with the pre-existing provision pertaining to use of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence.[28] He therefore thought that the word \"use\" in relation to a crime of violence means use as a weapon, and that this definition of use carried over to the addition of drug trafficking to the statute.[29]\\nThe Court again interpreted § 924(c) in United States v. Gonzales[30] and held that a sentence under § 924(c) could not be served concurrently with an unrelated sentence from a state conviction.[31] Finally, in Muscarello v. United States[32] the Court held that, as used in § 924(c), \"carries\" is not limited to the felon who carries the firearm on his person, but includes a gun brought to a drug transaction in the glove compartment of his vehicle.\\nWhat all this history reveals is that if the original version of § 924(c) governed Mr. Angelos\\' sentencing, the court could impose three separate one-year enhancements, adding a total of three years to his sentence. However, after 36 years of judicial interpretation and congressional modifications, the court is now left with a version of § 924(c) that requires a sentence of 55 years on top of a tough Guidelines sentence for drug dealing.\\n\\nIII. Mr. Angelos\\' Equal Protection Challenge to the Statute\\nMr. Angelos first contends that 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) makes arbitrary classifications and irrationally treats him far more harshly than criminals guilty of other much more serious crimes. He raises this claim as an equal protection challenge. The court will first set forth the law on such arguments and then turn to the merits of Mr. Angelos\\' claim.\\n\\nA. Equal Protection Review of Criminal Statutes\\n\\n1. General Equal Protection Principles\\nMr. Angelos can raise an equal protection challenge to classifications created by a federal criminal statute like § 924(c). While the Equal Protection Clause applies only to the states,[33] \"[t]he Fifth Amendment\\'s due process clause encompasses equal protection principles.\"[34] Under equal protection principles, the court\\'s review is quite limited. The Equal Protection Clause \"does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer\\'s Social Statistics\"[35] or any other personal view of a judge. Instead, unless a law infringes upon a fundamental right or classifies along suspect lines such as race, the court\\'s review is *1236 limited to determining whether there is a rational basis for the law.\\nMr. Angelos does not argue that his claim is subject to a heightened standard of review. The law is well-settled on the subject.[36] As explained by the Supreme Court:\\nEvery person has a fundamental right to liberty in the sense that the Government may not punish him unless and until it proves his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at a criminal trial conducted in accordance with the relevant constitutional guarantees.... But a person who has been so convicted is eligible for, and the court may impose, whatever punishment is authorized by statute for his offense, so long as that penalty is not cruel and unusual ... and so long as the penalty is not based on an arbitrary distinction that would violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. In this context ... an argument based on equal protection essentially duplicates an argument based on due process.[37]\\nThis holding places on Mr. Angelos a heavy burden of proof. First, \"statutory classifications will not be set aside on equal protection grounds if any ground can be conceived to justify them as rationally related to a legitimate government interest.\" [38] Second, \"those attacking the rationality of the legislative classification have the burden `to negate every conceivable basis\\' which might support it.\"[39] The government \"has no obligation to produce evidence to sustain the rationality of a statutory classification,\"[40] nor does Congress have to \"`articulate its reasons for enacting a statute\\'\"[41] \"[U]nder a rational basis analysis, [Congress] need not articulate the precise reasons why it chose to impose different sentences for different crimes; nothing in the Constitution prevents [Congress] from making classifications along non-suspect lines if there is a rational basis for doing so.\"[42] A statute can be both over-inclusive and under-inclusive and still pass rational basis review.[43] In sum, rational basis review is \"a paradigm of judicial restraint\" which \"presumes that ... even improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic process and that judicial intervention is generally unwarranted no matter how unwisely we may think a political branch has acted.\"[44] It is on this basis that the court will proceed.[45]\\n\\n\\n*1237 2. The Court\\'s Obligation to Search for a Rational Basis\\nThe Tenth Circuit has also instructed that rational basis review is not limited to the arguments advanced by the parties. In the recent civil case of Powers v. Harris,[46] the Circuit explained that even if the parties cannot conceive of a rational basis for the statute, the court is \"not bound by the parties\\' arguments\" but is \"`obligated to seek out other conceivable reasons for validating\\'\" the statute.[47] If this understanding of rationality review extends to criminal cases, then a defendant must not only negate all of the proposed grounds for a statute put forth by the government but also any rational basis which the court might conceive.\\nSuch a conclusion in a criminal case, however, is problematic in light of the defendant\\'s due process rights at sentencing. In Gardner v. Florida,[48] for example, the Supreme Court, noting that a criminal defendant \"has a legitimate interest in the character of the procedure which leads to the imposition of sentence,\"[49] held that it was a violation of due process for a trial court to impose the death sentence based partially on confidential information in the pre-sentence report which the defendant did not have a chance to rebut at sentencing. Gardner was a death penalty case, and there is some question about whether the due process requirements would apply in a non-capital case.[50] But here we have effectively a sentence of life in prison\\x97the next most serious punishment the law can impose.\\nThe Tenth Circuit has also provided guidance on the procedures to be followed at sentencing hearings. For example, in United States v. Beaulieu,[51] the *1238 Tenth Circuit held that while a judge may rely on reliable hearsay at the sentencing stage, the due process clause requires that the defendant \"be given adequate notice of and an opportunity to rebut or explain information that is used against him\" at sentencing.[52]\\nThese due process considerations are the basis for Rule 32(i) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which requires the court to give the defendant a chance to refute facts in the pre-sentence report.[53] But Rule 32(i) is not limited to factual allegations in the pre-sentence report. Specifically, Rule 32(i)(1)(C) states that the Court must afford counsel for the defendant an opportunity to \"comment on the probation officer\\'s determinations and on other matters relating to the appropriate sentence ....\"[54] Similarly, Rule 32(i)(3)(B) requires the court to make findings on any \"controverted matters.\" A matter cannot be \"controverted\" if it is hypothesized by the judge and the defendant never has an opportunity to comment on it.\\nRule 32 has been given an expansive reading by the Supreme Court. In Burns v. United States,[55] the Supreme Court considered whether a trial court could depart upwards from a Guidelines sentence sua sponte without notice to the defendant or the government. The Court held that Rule 32 requires that the defendant be notified beforehand of the court\\'s intention to depart upward so that he can challenge both the factual and the legal basis for doing so.[56] As Burns suggests, for the trial court to reach legal conclusions without first affording notice to the parties would \"render[ ] meaningless the parties\\' express right under Rule 32(a)(1) to `comment upon ... matters relating to the appropriate sentence\\'\" because the right to comment upon a departure has \"`little reality or worth unless one is informed\\' that a decision is contemplated.\"[57]\\nIf the court follows here the approach adopted by the Tenth Circuit in Potvers for civil cases, it could hold that § 924(c) is constitutional based solely on an argument hypothesized by the court without notice to the defense. Such an approach would clash with the purpose of Rule 32, which is to \"promote[ ] focused, adversarial resolution of the legal and factual issues\" relevant to fixing a sentence.[58] In Burns, the Court explained that allowing sua sponte departures would force the parties to hypothesize every potential departure and address them \"in a random and wasteful way by trying to anticipate and negate every conceivable ground on which the district court might choose to depart on its own initiative.\"[59]\\nOut of an abundance of caution, therefore, the court concludes that it should not uphold § 924(c) on grounds which the defendant has not had an opportunity to address. In reaching this conclusion, this court in no way intends to deviate from the standard rule that it is not necessary for the government to show the actual reason that Congress enacted a statute, be it civil or criminal.[60] The criminal cases supporting this rule, however, do not stand for the *1239 proposition that, in contrast to the ordinary rules of sentencing, the court can advance grounds to sustain a statute sua sponte without giving the defendant a chance to respond.[61]\\nFinally, the court has considered whether it might be feasible for it to conceive of grounds beyond those raised by the government or the defendant and then give the parties a further opportunity to brief and argue those additional grounds. Practical concerns, however, dictate against such an approach for a criminal sentencing, where the court must impose sentence \"without unnecessary delay.\"[62] Presumably these same concerns were at play in the Tenth Circuit\\'s decision in Powers. The Circuit did not call for additional briefing and argument there, probably because of the delay attendant to such a procedure.\\nIn reaching this conclusion, the court does not mean to suggest that there is some clearly \"winning\" argument that the government has simply failed to raise. The government has been ably represented throughout these proceedings by experienced and capable counsel. The government has briefed and argued the main grounds that can be advanced to sustain § 924(c) as applied in this case. Rather than chase down every hypothetical ground that could sustain the statute, the court will consider the grounds that have been briefed and argued in this case.\\n\\nB. The Irrationality of § 924(c)\\nMr. Angelos contends that § 924(c) effectively sentences him to life in prison and that this statutory scheme is irrational as applied to him. In particular, Mr. Angelos contends that § 924(c) leads to unjust punishment and creates irrational distinctions between different offenders and different offenses. The court will first review Mr. Angelos\\' claims about the statute\\'s infirmities, then consider the government\\'s defenses.\\n\\n1. Mr. Angelos Effectively Receives a Life Sentence Under § 924(c)\\nBefore turning to the merits of Mr. Angelos\\' claims, it is important to understand the length of the sentence that the government is asking the court to impose. If Angelos serves his full 61-12;year sentence, he will be 85 years old upon release. Assuming the 15 percent credit for good behavior, Mr. Angelos sentence will be reduced to \"only\" 55 years, leading to the earliest possible release date for Mr. Angelos at 77 years of age. The average life expectancy for males in the United States is about 74 years of age.[63] Therefore, under the best case scenario, Angelos might live long enough to be released from prison (assuming that the harshness of prison life does not decrease his life expectancy). Put another way, if the court imposes the sentence sought by the government, Mr. Angelos will effectively receive a sentence of life.\\n\\n2. Unjust Punishment from § 924(c)\\nMr. Angelos argues that his sentence is irrational because the enhancement provided for under § 924(c) increases his sentence by 55 years, whereas were the Guidelines alone to be applied, his sentence would be enhanced by only two years. Under the Guidelines, Mr. Angelos\\' *1240 sentence would have been increased by, at most, 24 months.[64] Because the relevant conduct was charged as three separate § 924(c) violations, however, the result was a sentence increased by 660 months, or 55 years. Cases such as this force the government to choose between charging defendants under § 924(c) or relying on the Guidelines\\' enhancement. As the Eleventh Circuit has noted, \"The relationship between § 924(c) and [the Guidelines enhancement] is an `either/or\\' relationship at sentencing. If a defendant is convicted [under § 924(c)], he must receive a five year consecutive sentence, but he cannot also have his base offense level enhanced pursuant to [the Guidelines enhancement] because such enhancement would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution. However, a defendant who is not convicted of a violation of § 924(c), may receive an enhancement of his base offense level for possession of a firearm in connection with a drug offense.\"[65] The government in this case chose to pursue § 924(c) counts rather than enhancements under the Guidelines.\\nThe Guidelines, Mr. Angelos argues, reflect the judgment of experts appointed by Congress to determine \"just punishment\" for federal criminal offenses. Because his sentence, the result of 924(c), is at such discrepancy with the Guidelines determination of \"just punishment,\" Mr. Angelos argues that his sentence is irrational.\\nIn imposing sentences in criminal cases, the court is required by the governing statute\\x97the Sentencing Reform Act[66]\\x97to\"impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in [the Act].\"[67] The purposes of sentencing set forth in the Sentencing Reform Act are:\\n(A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;\\n(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;\\n(C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and\\n(D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.[68]\\nTo give some real content to the Sentencing Reform Act\\'s directives, Congress established an expert body\\x97the United States Sentencing Commission\\x97to promulgate sentencing Guidelines for criminal offenses. The Sentencing Commission, after extensive review of sentencing practices across the country established a comprehensive set of sentencing guidelines. The Commission has carefully calibrated the Guidelines through annual amendments, and Congress has had the opportunity to reject and amend Guidelines that were not to its satisfaction.\\nThe Guidelines provide clear guidance on what is just punishment for federal offenses. To be sure, the constitutionality of the fact-finding apparatus attached to the Guidelines is currently under Supreme Court review,[69] and this court has held that in cases such as this one the Guidelines are advisory only.[70] But the substantive *1241 content of the Guidelines is what is relevant here. Both sides agree that the Guidelines should be considered as providing guidance on the appropriate penalty. Moreover, Congress has directed that courts must follow the Guidelines in imposing sentence unless some unusual factor justifies a departure.[71] As a result, Congress has in essence instructed the courts that the Guidelines provide \"just punishment\" for criminal offenses. It could hardly be otherwise, as Congress would not have gone to the trouble of having an expert body promulgate sentencing guidelines if those guidelines failed to prescribe the appropriate sentences. In short, the views of the Sentencing Commission are entitled to \"great weight because the Sentencing Commission is the expert body on federal sentencing.\"[72]\\nIn this case, neither side has offered any strong reason for believing that the sentence the Guidelines alone provide for would not achieve just punishment. The Guidelines specify sentences for all crimes covered by the federal criminal code, including all the crimes committed by Mr. Angelos. Setting aside the three firearms offenses covered by the § 924(c) counts, all of Mr. Angelos\\' other criminal conduct results in an offense level of 28. Because Mr. Angelos is a first-time offender, the Guidelines then specify a sentence of between 78 to 97 months. It is possible to determine, however, what a Guidelines sentence would be covering all of Mr. Angelos conduct, including that covered by the § 924(c) counts. If this conduct were punished under the Guidelines rather than under § 924(c), the result would be an additional two-level enhancement,[73] increasing the offense level from a level 28 to a level 30. This, in turn, produces a recommended Guidelines sentence for Mr. Angelos of 97 to 121 months. Thus, the Guidelines inform the court that Mr. Angelos\\' possession of firearms should increase his sentence by no more than 24 months (from a maximum of 97 months to a maximum of 121 months). This is a point worth emphasizing: the expert agency established by Congress to evaluate federal sentences and that the court must follow when imposing sentences has specified 24 months as the appropriate enhanced penalty for Mr. Angelos\\' possession of firearms and no more than 121 months as \"just punishment\" for all of Mr. Angelos\\' offenses.\\nBearing firmly in mind the conclusion of Congress\\' expert agency that 121 months is the longest appropriate prison term for all the criminal conduct in this case, it comes as a something of a shock to then consider the § 924(c) counts. Because Mr. Angelos\\' possession of firearms is punished not under the Guidelines but rather under § 924(c), the court is required to impose an additional penalty of 660 months (55 years) instead of the 24 month enhancement provided for by the Guidelines. It is not at all clear how the court can reconcile these two sentences. Knowing that the congressionally-approved Guidelines provide for an additional 24 month penalty for the firearms at issue, can the court conclude that an additional 660 months is a \"just punishment\"? One architect of the Guidelines has recognized the problem of the discrepancy:\\n\\n*1242 The compatibility of the guidelines system and mandatory minimums is also in question. While the Commission has consistently sought to incorporate mandatory minimums into the guidelines system in an effective and reasonable manner, in certain fundamental respects, the general approaches of the two systems are inconsistent.... Whereas the guidelines provide for graduated increases in sentence severity for additional wrongdoing or for prior convictions, mandatory minimums often result in sharp variations in sentences based on what are often only minimal differences in criminal conduct or prior record. Finally, whereas the guidelines incorporate a \"real offense\" approach to sentencing, mandatory minimums are basically a \"charge-specific\" approach wherein the sentence is triggered only if the prosecutor chooses to charge the defendant with a certain offense or to allege certain facts.[74]\\nThere is, of course, the possibility that the Sentencing Guidelines are too low in this case and that mandatory minimums specify the proper sentence. The more the court investigates, however, the more the court finds evidence that the § 924(c) counts here lead to unjust punishment. For starters, the court asked the twelve jurors in this case what they believed was the appropriate punishment for Mr. Angelos. Following the trial, the court sent\\x97over the government\\'s objection\\x97each of the jurors the relevant information about Mr. Angelos\\' limited criminal history, described the abolition of parole in the federal system, and asked the jurors what they believed was the appropriate penalty for Mr. Angelos. Nine jurors responded and gave the following recommendations: (1) 5 years; (2) 5-7 years; (3) 10 years; (4) 10 years; (5) 15 years; (6) 15 years; (7) 15-20 years; (8) 32 years; and (9) 50 years. Averaging these answers, the jurors recommended a mean sentence of about 18 years and a median sentence of 15 years. Not one of the jurors recommended a sentence closely approaching the 61½ year sentence created by § 924(c).\\nAt oral argument, the court asked the government what it thought about the jurors\\' recommendations and whether it was appropriate to impose a sentence so much higher than what the jurors thought appropriate. The government\\'s response was quite curious: \"Judge, we don\\'t know if that jury is a random representative sample of the citizens of the United States....\"[75] Of course, the whole point of the elaborate jury selection procedures used in this case was to assure that the jury was, indeed, such a fair cross section of the population so that the verdict would be accepted with confidence. It is hard to understand why the government would be willing to accept the decision of the jury as to the guilt of the defendant but not as to the length of sentence that might be imposed.\\nMore important, the jurors\\' answers appear to reflect a representative of what people across the country believe. The crimes committed by Mr. Angelos are not uniquely federal crimes. They could have been prosecuted in state court in Utah or elsewhere across the country. The court *1243 asked the Probation Office to determine what the penalty would have been in Utah state court had Mr. Angelos been prosecuted there. The Probation Office reported that Mr. Angelos would likely have been paroled after serving about two to three years in prison. The government gives a substantially similar estimate, reporting that on its understanding of Utah sentencing practices Mr. Angelos would have served about five to seven years in prison.[76] Even taking the higher figure from the government, the § 924(c) counts in this case result in punishment far beyond what Utah\\'s citizens, through its state criminal justice system, provides as just punishment for such crimes.\\nThe same conclusion obtains if the comparison is to the sentence that would be imposed in other states. Indeed, the government conceded that Mr. Angelos\\' federal sentence after application of the § 924(c) counts is more than he would have received in any of the fifty states.[77]\\nOf course, one way of determining what people across the country believe is to look to the actions of Congress. Congress serves as the nation\\'s elected representatives, so actions taken by Congress presumably reflect the will of the people. The difficulty here is that Congress has taken two actions: (1) it created the Sentencing Commission and (2) adopted § 924(c). As between these two conflicting actions, the sentences prescribed by the Sentencing Commission more closely reflect the views of the country. And, indeed, empirical research has demonstrated that the Sentencing Guidelines generally produce sentences that are at least as harsh as those that the public would wish to see imposed.[78]\\nIn sum, the court is faced with the fact that § 924(c) produces punishment in this case far beyond that called for by the congressionally-created expert agency on sentencing, by the jurors who heard the evidence, by the Utah state system, or by any of the other state systems. If the court is to take seriously the directive that it should impose \"just punishment\" with its sentences, then it should impose sentences that are viewed as appropriate by the citizens of this state and of this country. The court concludes that placing Mr. Angelos in prison for 61½ years is not \"just punishment\" for his crimes. This factor suggests the irrationality of § 924(c).\\n\\n3. Irrational Classifications\\nThe next factor the court should consider is Mr. Angelos\\' argument that § 924(c) creates irrational classifications, between different offenses and different offenders. The court will consider each of these arguments in turn.\\n\\na. Classifications Between Offenses\\nMr. Angelos contends that his § 924(c) sentence is not only unjust but also irrational when compared to the punishment imposed for other more serious federal crimes. Perhaps realizing where this evaluation will inevitably lead, the government initially argues that any comparison is futile because, as the Supreme Court suggested in its 1980 decision Rummel v. Estelle, different \"crimes ... implicate other societal interests, making any comparison inherently speculative.\"[79] At *1244 some level, this argument is correct; fine distinctions between the relative severity of some kinds of crimes are hard to make. It is difficult to compare, as Rummel points out, the crime of embezzlement of millions of dollars with the crime of taking a small amount of money at gun point.[80]\\nBut general comparisons of crimes are possible. Some crimes have, for example, a common denominator that permits comparison. As the Supreme Court clarified three years after Rummel in Solem v. Helm, \"stealing a million dollars is viewed as more serious than stealing a hundred dollars.\" [81] More important, Solem pointed to various factors that can be assessed relatively objectively. In instructing the court to judge the gravity of the offense in the cruel and unusual punishment context, the Court noted that its holding \"assumes that courts are competent to judge the gravity of an offense, at least on a relative scale. In a broad sense this assumption is justified, and courts traditionally have made these judgments\\x97just as legislatures must make them in the first instance. Comparisons can be made in light of the harm caused or threatened to the victim or society, and the culpability of the offender.\"[82] Therefore, in determining whether Congress has created irrational classifications with § 924(c), the court can be guided not by any subjective views on how harshly to punish a particular crime, but rather how the punishment for that crime compares to that imposed for other undoubtedly more serious offenses.\\nIn evaluating the § 924(c) counts, the court starts from the premise that Mr. Angelos committed serious crimes. Trafficking in illegal drugs runs the risk of ruining lives through addiction and the violence that the drug trade spawns. As the government properly argued, when a defendant engages in a drug-trafficking operation and \"carries and possesses firearms to aid in that venture, as was the case here, the actual threat of violence always exists, even it if does not actually occur.\"[83] But do any of these general rationales provide a rational basis for punishing the potential violence which § 924(c) is meant to deter more harshly than actual violence that harms a victim in its wake? In other words, is it rational to punish a person who might shoot someone with a gun he carried far more harshly than the person who actually does shoot or harm someone?\\nAs applied in this case, the classifications created by § 924(c) are simply irrational. Section 924(c) imposes on Mr. Angelos a sentence 55 years or 660 months. Added to the minimum 78-month Guidelines sentence for a total sentence of 738 months, Mr. Angelos is facing a prison term which more than doubles the sentence of, for example, an aircraft hijacker (293 months),[84] a terrorist who detonates a bomb in a public place (235 months),[85] a *1245 racist who attacks a minority with the to kill and inflicts permanent or life-threatening injuries (210 months),[86] a second-degree murderer,[87] or a rapist.[88] Table I 1 below sets out these and other examples of shorter sentences for crimes far more serious than Mr. Angelos\\'.\\n\\n\\n                                        Table I\\n                     Comparison of Mr.Angelos\\' Senteces with Federal Sentences\\n                             for Other Crimes Committed Three Times\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOffense and Offense Guideline                     Offense              Maximum\\n                                                           Calculation            Sentence\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMr. Angelos with Guidelines sentence plus § 924(c)      Base Offense Level                  738 Months\\ncounts                                                       28 + 3 § 924(c)\\n                                                             counts (55 vears)\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nKingpin of major drug trafficking ring in which              Base Offense Level                  293 Months\\ndeath resulted U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(a)(2)                   38\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nAircraft hijacker U.S.S.G. § 2A5.1                      Base Offense Level                  293 Months\\n                                                             38\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nTerrorist who detonates a bomb in a public place             Total Level 36 (by                  235 Months\\nintending to kill a bystander U.S.S.G. § 2K1.4(a)(1)    cross reference to\\n                                                             § 2A2.1(a)(2) and\\n                                                             terrorist enhancement\\n                                                             in § 3A1.4(a))\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nRacist who attacks a minority with the intent to kill        Base Level 28 + 4\\nU.S.S.G. § 2A2.1(a)(1) & (b)(1)                         for life threatening\\n                                                             + 3 for racial\\n                                                             selection under\\n                                                             § 3A1.1\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSpy who gathers top secret information U.S.S.G.

No changes were suggested. At oral argument, to its credit, the government conceded that at least some of the crimes in the table involved crimes more serious than those committed by Mr. Angelos. Thus, the government agreed (after extensive questioning from the court) that Mr. Angelos has committed less serious crimes than a second-degree murderer,[89] a marijuana dealer who shoots someone,[90] or a rapist.[91] The government maintained, however, that the court was not making the proper comparison. Because Mr. Angelos was convicted of three counts of violating § 924(c), the government argued, the proper comparison is between Mr. Angelos and a three-time hijacker, a three-time rapist, or a three-time second degree murderer. The government maintains that \"the hijacker and kidnapper would serve much longer sentences if they were sentenced for committing those crimes three separate times.\"[92]\\nThe government\\'s argument misses the whole point of the comparison. All of Mr. Angelos\\' crimes taken together are less serious than, for example, even a single aircraft hijacking, a single second-degree murder, or a single rape. But even adopting the government\\'s approach, the irrationality of the scheme only becomes more apparent. Amazingly, Mr. Angelos\\' sentence under § 924(c) is still far more severe than criminals who committed, for example, three aircraft hijackings, three second-degree murders, three kidnappings, or three rapes. Table II reflects a trebling of all the crimes in Table I. Mr. Angelos will receive a longer sentence than any three-time criminal, with the sole exception of a marijuana dealer who shoots three people. (Mr. Angelos still receives a longer sentence than a marijuana dealer who shoots two people.)\\n\\n\\n*1247\\n                                          Table II\\n                     Comparison of

30\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe irrationality of these differences is manifest and can be objectively proven. In the Eighth Amendment context, the Supreme Court has instructed that \"[c]omparisons can be made in light of the harm caused or threatened to the victim or society, and the culpability of the offender.\"[93] In contrast to the serious violent felonies listed in tables I and II, the crimes committed by Mr. Angelos had the potential for violence, but no actual violence occurred. This is not to say that trafficking in illegal drugs is somehow a non-violent offense. Indeed, in Harmelin, Justice Kennedy quite properly called such an assertion \"false to the point of absurdity.\"[94]*1248 Harmelin involved the potential distribution of approximately 32,500 doses of cocaine, a highly addictive drug that was linked to many of the homicides in Detroit.[95] Justice Kennedy\\'s concurrence equated the crime in Harmelin with \"felony murder without specific intent to kill.\"[96]\\nIn this case, however, Mr. Angelos will be completely punished for his marijuana trafficking by the 78-97 month Guidelines sentence he receives. The § 924(c) counts pile on an additional 55 years solely for three offenses of possessing firearms in connection with that trafficking. He receives a five-year and then another twenty-five-year sentence for counts 2 and 4, which involved carrying a gun in an ankle holster during a drug deal with one other person for several hundred dollars in marijuana. He receives another twenty-five-year sentence for Count 10, which involved three handguns found in Angelos\\' apartment during the execution of a search warrant. Section 924(c) punishes Angelos more harshly for crimes that threaten potential violence than for crimes that conclude in actual violence to victims (e.g., aircraft hijacking, second-degree murder, racist assaults, kidnapping, and rape). This factor, therefore, also suggests the irrationality of § 924(c).\\n\\nb. Irrational Classifications Between Offenders\\nMr. Angelos also argues that § 924(c) is irrational in failing to distinguish between the recidivist and the first-time offender. Section 924(c) increases penalties for a \"second or subsequent conviction under this subsection.\"[97] This language can be interpreted in two different ways. One construction would be that an offender who is convicted of a § 924(c) violation, serves his time, and then commits a subsequent violation is subject to an enhanced penalty. This was the construction that the Tenth Circuit (among other courts) originally gave to the statute.[98]\\nAnother, far more expansive construction would be that an offender who is convicted of two or more counts is subject to an enhanced penalty for each count after the first count of conviction. In 1993 in Deal v. United States,[99] the Supreme Court adopted this second construction, reading the \"second or subsequent\" language in § 924(c) to apply equally to the recidivist who is convicted of violating § 924(c) on separate occasions after serving prison time and to the defendant who is convicted of multiple § 924(c) counts in the same proceeding stemming from a single indictment. The Court concluded (over the dissents of three Justices) that the unambiguous phrase \"subsequent conviction\" in the statute permitted no distinction between the time at which the convictions took place.[100] In addition, all time imposed for each § 924(c) count must run consecutively to any other sentence.[101] This is what is known as \"count stacking.\"\\nWhen multiple § 924(c) counts are stacked on top of each other, they produce lengthy sentences that fail to distinguish between first offenders (like Mr. Angelos) and recidivist offenders. As John R. *1249 Steer, Vice Chair of the United States Sentencing Commission, has explained:\\n[C]onsider the effects if prosecutors pursued every possible count of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c).... The statute provides for minimum consecutive sentence enhancements of 25 years to life for the second and subsequent conviction under the statute, even if all the counts are charged, convicted, and sentenced at the same time. Pursuing multiple § 924(c) charges at the same time has been called \"count stacking\" and has resulted in sentences of life imprisonment (or aggregate sentences for a term of years far exceeding life expectancy) for some offenders with little or no criminal history.[102]\\nConsider the way in which the § 924(c) counts stack up on Mr. Angelos. He is currently 24 years old. He is to receive at least 78 months for the underlying offenses. Stacked on top of this is another 5 years for the first § 924(c) conviction. Stacked on top of this is another 25 years for the second § 924(c) conviction. And finally, another 25 years is stacked on top for the third § 924(c) conviction. Even assuming credit for good time served, Mr. Angelos will be more than 55-years-old before he even begins to serve the final 25 years his sentence. This happens not because Mr. Angelos \"failed to learn his lessons from the initial punishment\" and committed a repeat offense. Section 924(c) jumps from a five-year mandatory sentence for a first violation to a 25-year mandatory sentence for a second violation, which may occur just days (or even hours) later. It is not a recidivist provision.\\nOther true recidivist statutes do not operate this way. Instead, they graduate punishment (albeit only roughly) between first offenders and subsequent offenders. California\\'s tough three-strikes-and-you\\'re-out law can serve as a convenient illustration. Prompted by violence from career criminals who had been in prison and released,[103] California passed a law requiring lengthy prison terms for third-time offenders, even where the third offense could be viewed as relatively minor. Last year in Swing v. California,[104] the Supreme Court upheld a twenty-five to life sentence under California\\'s three-strikes law. While defendant Ewing\\'s third offense was merely stealing $399 worth of golf equipment, the controlling opinion noted that the policy of the law was to \"incapacitatfe] and deter[ ] repeat offenders who threaten the public safety. The law was designed `to ensure longer prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have been previously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses.\\'\"[105] In the end, the Court concluded that Ewing\\'s sentence was justified \"by his own long, serious criminal record [including] numerous misdemeanor and felony offenses ... nine separate terms of incarceration ... and crimes [committed] while on probation or parole.\"[106]\\nSimilarly, in the earlier case of Rummel,[107] the Court saw a critical distinction between first and repeat offenders. In *1250 that case, the defendant was convicted of a third felony for obtaining $120 by false pretenses and was sentenced to mandatory life imprisonment under a recidivist statute. The Court found it important to examine the \"exact operation\" of the statute at issue and found three important factors suggesting a legitimate basis for such a harsh punishment:\\nFirst, [Rummel] had to be convicted of a felony and actually sentenced to prison. Second, at some time subsequent to his first conviction, Rummel had to be convicted of another felony and again sentenced to imprisonment. Finally, after having been sent to prison a second time, Rummel had to be convicted of a third felony.... Given this necessary sequence, a recidivist must twice demonstrate that conviction and actual imprisonment do not deter him from returning to crime once he is released. One in Rummel\\'s position has been both graphically informed of the consequences of lawlessness and given an opportunity to reform, all to no avail.[108]\\nWhile some might raise theoretical objections to such recidivist statutes,[109] their underlying logic is clear and unassailable. But no such logic can justify § 924(c), at least when applied to first offenders such as Mr. Angelos. In cases such as his, the statute blindly draws no distinction between recidivists and first-time offenders. For this reason as well, the statute appears to be irrational as applied in this case.\\nThe irrationality only increases when section § 924(c) is compared to the federal \"three strikes\" provision. Criminals with two prior violent felony convictions who commit a third such offense are subject to \"mandatory\" life imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. § 3559(c)\\x97the federal \"three-strikes\" law. But then under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)\\x97commonly known as the \"compassionate release\" provision\\x97these criminals can be released at age 70 if they have served 30 years in prison. But because this compassionate release provision applies to sentences imposed under § 3559(c)\\x97not § 924(c)\\x97offenders like Mr. Angelos are not eligible. Thus, while the 24-year-old Mr. Angelos must serve time until he is well into his 70\\'s, a 40-year-old recidivist criminal who commits second degree murder, hijacks an aircraft, or rapes a child is potentially eligible for release at age 70. In other words, mandatory life imprisonment under the federal three-strikes law for persons guilty of three violent felony convictions is less mandatory than mandatory time imposed on the first-time offender under § 924(c). Again, the rationality of this arrangement is dubious.\\nThis possibility, too, is no mere hypothetical. This morning, the court had before it for sentencing Thomas Ray Gurule.[110] Mr. Gurule is 54-years-old with a lifelong history of criminal activity and drug abuse. He has spent more of his life incarcerated than he has in the community. He has sixteen adult criminal convictions on his record, including two robbery convictions involving dangerous weapons. His most recent conviction was for carjacking. In August 2003, after failing to pay for gas at a service station, Mr. Gurule was pursued by the station manager. To escape, Mr. Gurule broke into the home of a young woman, held her at knife point, stole her jewelry, and forced her to drive *1251 him away from the scene of his crimes. During the drive, Mr. Gurule threatened both the woman and her family.\\n\\nFor this serious offense\\x97the latest in a long string of crimes for which he has been convicted\\x97the court must apparently sentence Mr. Gurule to \"life\" in prison under 18 U.S.C. § 3559(c). But because of the compassionate release provision, Mr. Gurule is eligible for release after serving 30-years of his sentence. Why Mr. Gurule, a career criminal, should be eligible for this compassionate release while Mr. Angelos is not obvious to the court.\\n\\n4. Demeaning Victims of Actual Violence and Creating the Risk of Backlash\\nFor the reasons outlined in the previous section, § 924(c) imposes unjust punishment and creates irrational classifications between different offenses and different offenders. To some, this may seem like a law professor\\'s argument\\x97one that may have some validity in the classroom but little salience in the real world. After all, the only issue in this case is the extent of punishment for a man justly convicted of serious drug trafficking offenses. So what, some may say, if he spends more years in prison than might be theoretically justified? It is common wisdom that \"if you can\\'t do the time, don\\'t do the crime.\"\\nThe problem with this simplistic position is that it overlooks other interests that are inevitably involved in the imposition of a criminal sentence. For example, crime victims expect that the penalties the court imposes will fairly reflect the harms that they have suffered. When the sentence for actual violence inflicted on a victim is dwarfed by a sentence for carrying guns to several drug deals, the implicit message to victims is that their pain and suffering counts for less than some abstract \"war on drugs.\"\\nThis is no mere academic point, as a case from this court\\'s docket will illustrate. Earlier today, shortly before Mr. Angelos\\' hearing, the court imposed sentence in United States v. Visinaiz, 344 F.Supp.2d 1310 (D.Utah 2004), a second-degree murder case.[111] There, a jury convicted Cruz Joaquin Visinaiz of second-degree murder in the death of 68-year-old Clara Jenkins. On one evening, while drinking together, the two got into an argument. Ms. Jenkins threw an empty bottle at Mr. Visinaiz, who then proceeded to beat her to death by striking her in the head at least three times with a log. Mr. Visinaiz then hid the body in a crawl space of his home, later dumping the body in a river weighted down with cement blocks. Following his conviction for second-degree murder, Mr. Visinaiz came before the court as a firsttime offender for sentencing. The Sentencing Guidelines require a sentence for this brutal second-degree murder of between 210 to 262 months.[112] The government called this an \"aggravated seconddegree murder\" and recommended a sentence of 262 months. The court followed that recommendation. Yet on the same day, the court is to impose a sentence of 738 months for a first-time drug dealer who carried a gun to several drug deals!? The victim\\'s family in the Visinaiz case\\x97 not to mention victims of a vast array of other violent crimes\\x97can be forgiven if they think that the federal criminal justice system minimizes their losses. No doubt § 924(c) is motivated by the best of intentions\\x97to prevent criminal victimization. But the statute pursues that goal in a way that effectively sends a message to victims *1252 of actual criminal violence that their suffering is not fully considered by the system.\\nAnother reason for concern is that the unjust penalties imposed by § 924(c) can be expected to attract public notice. As shown earlier, applying § 924(c) to cases such as this one leads to sentences far in excess of what the public believes is appropriate. Perhaps in the short term, no ill effects will come from the difference between public expectations and actual sentences. But in the longer term, the federal criminal justice system will suffer. Most seriously, jurors may stop voting to convict drug dealers in federal criminal prosecutions if they are aware that unjust punishment may follow. It only takes a single juror who is worried about unjust sentencing to \"hang\" a jury and prevent a conviction. This is not an abstract concern. In the case of United States v. Molina[113] the jury failed to reach a verdict on a § 924(c) count which would have added 30 years to the defendant\\'s sentence. Judge Weinstein, commenting on \"the dubious state of our criminal sentencing law\" [114] noted that \"Ljjury nullification of sentences deemed too harsh is increasingly reflected in refusals to convict.\"[115] In the last several drug trials before this court, jurors have privately expressed considerable concern after their verdicts about what sentences might be imposed. If federal juries are to continue to convict the guilty, those juries must have confidence that just punishment will follow from their verdicts.\\n\\nC. Justifications for § 924(c)\\nGiven these many problems with § 924(c) as applied to this case\\x97its imposition of unjust punishment, its irrational classifications between offenses and offenders, and its demeaning of victims of actual criminal violence\\x97what can be said on behalf of the statute? The Sentencing Commission has catalogued the six rationales that are said to undergird mandatory sentencing schemes such as § 924(c):\\n(1) Assuring \"just\" (i.e. appropriately severe) punishment, (2) elimination of sentence disparities, (3) judicial economies resulting from increased pressure on defendants to plead guilty, (4) stronger inducements for knowledgeable offenders to cooperate in the investigation of others, (5) more effective deterrence, and (6) more effective incapacitation of the serious offender.[116]\\nThese six justifications potentially apply to § 924(c), and the court will consider them as they are advanced by the government.\\nIn its skillfully-argued defense of the § 924(c) sentence here, the government does not rely on the first rationale\\x97the \"just punishment\" rationale\\x97presumably because the sentence to be imposed on Mr. Angelos appears to be unjust by any reasonable objective measure.\\nNor does the government advance the second rationale: that § 924(c) eliminates sentence disparities. Again, the reasons are easy to see. Section 924(c) displaces a carefully-developed sentencing guideline system that would assure that Mr. Angelos receives equal punishment with other similarly-placed offenders. Indeed, § 924(c) creates the potential for tremendous sentencing disparity if federal prosecutors across the country do not uniformly charge § 924(c) violations. Such concerns are founded in real world data. In 1991, the Sentencing Commission found that only about 45 percent of drug offenders who qualified for a § 924(c) enhancement were initially charged under the statute, and for *1253 26 percent of these offenders the counts were later dismissed.[117] In 1995, the Commission again found that only a minority of qualified offenders\\x97between 24 and 44 percent\\x97were convicted and sentenced for applicable § 924(c)\\'s.[118] Again in 2000, the Commission found a pattern of inconsistent application. Only between 10 and 30 percent of drug offenders who personally used, carried, or possessed a weapon in furtherance of a crime received the statutory enhancement.[119]\\nThe Justice Department has recently taken partial steps to reduce charging disparities stemming from § 924(c). A directive from the Attorney General\\x97the socalled \"Ashcroft Memorandum\"\\x97requires that prosecutors shall file the first readily provable § 924(c) count and a second count in certain circumstances:\\n(i) In all but exceptional cases or where the total sentence would not be affected, the first readily provable violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) shall be charged and pursued.\\n(ii) In cases involving three or more readily provable violations of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) in which the predicate offenses are crimes of violence, federal prosecutors shall, in all but exceptional cases, charge and pursue the first two such violations.[120]\\nAs applied to the facts of this case, the Ashcroft Memorandum seems only to highlight the problem of disparity rather than resolve it. First, when three or more violations of § 924(c) are involved, the directive requires federal prosecutors to \"pursue the first two violations.\" In this case, the prosecutors pursued five violations, ultimately obtaining convictions on three. It seems likely that the prosecutors\\' charging decisions in this case would not have been replicated in other parts of the country. Second, the directive requires federal prosecutors to pursue at least two § 924(c) counts when the predicate offenses are \"crimes of violence.\" Here, the predicates were drug crimes, which the directive does not discuss. Thus, the directive offers no guidance as to whether the prosecutors handling this case should have pursued multiple § 924(c) counts and, if so, how many.\\nThere is also a lack of guidance to federal agents investigating these crimes. In this case, for example, the government did not arrest Mr. Angelos immediately after the first \"controlled buy,\" but instead arranged two more such buys, which then produced one of the additional § 924(c) counts. It is not clear to the court that other law enforcement agents would have allowed Mr. Angelos to continue to deal drugs after the first buy rather than taking him into custody immediately. Of course, one of the rationales for the \"stacking\" feature of § 924(c) is that each additional criminal act demonstrates need for further deterrence. In this case, though, the additional criminal acts were in some sense procured by the government.\\nBecause of the lack of guidance on these prosecutory and investigative issues, Mr. Angelos is probably receiving a sentence far in excess of what many other identically-situated offenders will receive for identical crimes in other federal districts. The court has been advised by judges from other parts of the country that, in their *1254 districts, an offender like Mr. Angelos would not have been charged with multiple § 924(c) counts. This is no trivial matter. The decision to pursue, for example, a third § 924(c) count in this case makes the difference between a 36-year-sentence and 61-year sentence. In short, § 924(c) as applied in this case seems to create the serious risk of massive sentencing disparity between identically-situated offenders within the federal system. And the problem of disparity only worsens if we acknowledge the fact that Mr. Angelos would not have been charged with federal crimes in many other states. For all these reasons, the government could not plausibly defend § 924(c) on an eliminating-disparity rationale.\\nThe government has also not advanced the third rationale\\x97judicial economies resulting from increased pressure on defendants to plead guilty. Here again, it is possible to understand the government\\'s reluctance. While it is constitutionally permissible for the government to threaten to file enhanced charges against a defendant who fails to plead guilty,[121] there is always the nagging suspicion that the practice is unseemly. In this case, for example, the government initially offered Mr. Angelos a plea bargain in which he would receive a fifteen-year-sentence under one § 924(c) count. When he had the temerity to decline, the government filed superseding indictments adding four additional § 924(c) counts. So far as the court can determine, the superceding indictment rested not on any newly-discovered evidenced but rather solely on the defendant\\'s unwillingness to plead guilty. Moreover, if its plea-inducing properties justify § 924(c), then it is important to understand who will be induced to plead. Section 924(c) will not visit its harsh punishment \"on flagrantly guilty repeat offenders (who avoid the mandatory by their guilty pleas), but rather on first offenders in borderline situations (who may have plausible defenses and are more likely to insist upon trial).\" [122] For all these reasons, it is understandable that the government would not want to publicly defend § 924(c) with the plea-inducing argument, even though given the realities of overworked prosecutors this may provide a true justification for the statute. Nor has the government argued that § 924(c) is needed to provide incentives for drug traffickers to inform on others in their organization.[123] Instead, the rationale advanced by government is deterrence and incapacitation: the draconian provisions of § 924(c) are necessary to deter drug dealers from committing crimes with those firearms and to prevent Mr. Angelos from doing so in the future.\\nThe deterrence argument rests on a strong intuitive logic. Sending a message to drug dealers that they will serve additional time in prison if they are caught with firearms may lead some to avoid firearms entirely and others to leave their firearms at home. The Supreme Court has specifically noted \"the deterrence rationale of § 924(c),\" [124] explaining that a fundamental purpose behind § 924(c) was to combat the dangerous combination of drugs and firearms.[125] Congress is certainly *1255 entitled to legislate based on the belief that § 924(c) will \"persuade the man tempted to commit a Federal felony to leave his gun at home.\" [126]\\nCongress\\' belief is, moreover, supported by empirical evidence. Generally criminologists believe that an increase in prison populations will reduce crime through both a deterrent and incapacitative effect. The consensus view appears to be that each 10% increase in the prison population produces about a 1% to 3% decrease in serious crimes.[127] For example, one recent study concluded that California\\'s three strikes law prevented 8 murders, 4000 aggravated assaults, 10,000 robberies, and 400,000 burglaries in its first two years of operation.[128] One study found that Congress\\' financial incentives to states to which (like the federal system) force violent offenders to serve 85% of their sentences decreased murders by 16%, aggravated assaults by 12%, robberies by 24%, rapes by 12%, and larcenies by 3%. While offenders \"substituted\" into less harmful property crimes, the overall reduction in crime was significant.[129] While no specific study has examined § 924(c), it is reasonable to assume\\x97and Congress is entitled to assume\\x97that it has prevented some serious drug and firearms offenses.\\nThe problem with the deterrence argument, however, is that it proves too much. A statute that provides mandatory life sentences for jaywalking or petty theft would, no doubt, deter those offenses. But it would be hard to view such hypothetical statutes as resting on rational premises. Moreover, a mandatory life sentence for petty theft, for example, would raise the question of why such penalties were not in place for aircraft hijacking, second-degree murder, rape, and other serious crimes. Finally, deterrence comes at a price. Given that holding a person in federal prison costs about $23,000 per year,[130] the 61-year-sentence the court is being asked to impose in this case will cost the taxpayers (even assuming Mr. Angelos receives good time credit and serves \"only\" 55-years) about $1,265,000. Spending more than a million dollars to incarcerate Mr. Angelos will prevent future crimes by him and may well deter some others from being involved with drugs and guns. But that money could also be spent on other law enforcement or social programs that in all likelihood would produce greater reductions in crime and victimization.[131]\\nIf the court were to evaluate these competing tradeoffs, it would conclude that stacking § 924(c) counts on top of each other for first-time drug offenders who have merely possessed firearms is not a cost-effective way of obtaining deterrence. It is not enough to simply be \"tough\" on crime. Given limited resources in our society, we also have to be \"smart\" in the way we allocate our resources. But these tradeoffs are the subject of reasonable debate. *1256 It is not the proper business of the court to second-guess the congressional judgment that § 924(c) is a wise investment of resources. Instead, in conducting rational basis review of the statute, the court is only to determine whether \"any ground can be conceived to justify [the statutory scheme] as rationally related to a legitimate government interest.\"[132] \"Where there are \\'plausible reasons\\' for Congress\\' action, [the court\\'s] inquiry is at an end.\"[133] In Busic referring to Simpson, the Supreme Court recognized that § 924(c) could lead to \"seemingly unreasonable comparative sentences\" but that \"[i]f corrective action is needed it is the Congress that must provide it. It is not for us to speculate, much less act, on whether Congress would have altered its stance had the specific events of this case been anticipated.\" [134] The Court further noted that \"in our constitutional system the commitment to separation of powers is too fundamental for us to pre-empt congressional action by judicially decreeing what accords with `commonsense and the public weal\\'\"[135]\\nAccordingly, the court reluctantly concludes that § 924(c) survives rational basis scrutiny. While it imposes unjust punishment and creates irrational classifications, there is a \"plausible reason\" for Congress\\' action. As a result, this court\\'s obligation is to follow the law and to reject Mr. Angelos\\' equal protection challenge to the statute.\\n\\nIV. Cruel and Unusual Punishment\\nIn addition to raising an equal protection argument, Mr. Angelos also argues that his 55-year sentence under § 924(c) violates the Eighth Amendment\\'s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. In this argument, he is joined in an amicus brief filed by a distinguished group of 29 former United States District Judges, United States Circuit Court Judges, and United States Attorneys,[136] who draw on their expertise in federal criminal law and federal sentencing issues to urge that the sentence is unconstitutional as disproportionate to the offenses at hand.\\nMr. Angelos and his supporting amici are correct in urging that controlling Eighth Amendment case law places an outer limit on punishments that can be imposed for criminal offenses, forbidding penalties that are grossly disproportionate to any offense. This principle traces its roots to the Supreme Court\\'s 1983 decision in Solem v. Helm,[137] in which the Supreme Court seemed to modify its earlier holding in Rummel v. Estelle[138] and \"h[e]ld as a matter of principle that a criminal sentence must be proportionate to the crime for which the defendant has been convicted.\"[139]*1257 The principles of Solem were themselves seemingly modified by the Court\\'s fractured 1991 decision in Harmelin v. Michigan,[140] in which the Court held that imposition of a life sentence without possibility of parole for possession of 650 grams of cocaine did not violate the Eighth Amendment. Then, last year, the Supreme Court confirmed that the gross disproportionality principle\\x97\"the precise contours of which are unclear\"[141]\\x97is applicable to sentences for terms of years; that there was a \"lack of clarity\" in its precedents;[142] that it had \"not established a clear or consistent path for courts to follow;\"[143] and that the proportionality principles from Justice Kennedy\\'s Harmelin concurrence \"guide our application of the Eighth Amendment.\"[144] The Tenth Circuit, too, has instructed that \"Justice Kennedy\\'s opinion controls because it both retains proportionality and narrows Solem.\"[145]\\nIn light of these controlling holdings, the court must engage in a proportionality analysis guided by factors outlined in Justice Kennedy\\'s Harmelin concurrence. In particular, the court must examine (1) the nature of the crime and its relation to the punishment imposed, (2) the punishment for other offenses in this jurisdiction, and (3) the punishment for similar offenses in other jurisdictions.\\nBefore turning to these Harmelin factors, it is important to emphasize that the criminal conduct at issue is solely that covered by the three § 924(c) counts. Mr. Angelos will be fully and appropriately punished for all other criminal conduct from the sentence on these other counts. Thus, the proportionality question in this case boils down to whether the 55-year sentence is November 16, 2004 disproportionate to the offense of carrying or possessing firearms three times in connection with dealing marijuana.\\n\\n>A. Mr. Angelos\\' Offenses and the Contemplated Penalty\\nThe first Harmelin factor requires the court to compare the seriousness of the three § 924(c) offenses to the harshness of the contemplated penalty to determine if the penalty would be grossly disproportionate to such offenses. In weighing the gravity of the offenses, the court should consider the offenses of conviction and the defendant\\'s criminal history,[146] as well as \"the harm caused or threatened to the victim or society, and the culpability of the offender.\"[147] Simply put, \"[d]isproportionality analysis measures the relationship between the nature and number of offenses committed and the severity of the punishment inflicted upon the offender.\" [148]\\nThe criminal history in this case is easy to describe. Mr. Angelos has no prior *1258 adult criminal convictions and is treated as a first-time offender under the Sentencing Guidelines.\\nThe sentence-triggering criminal conduct in this case is also modest. Here, on two occasions while selling small amounts of marijuana, Mr. Angelos possessed a handgun under his clothing, but he never brandished or used the handgun. The third relevant crime occurred when the police searched his home and found handguns in his residence. These handguns had multiple purposes\\x97including recreational activities\\x97but because Mr. Angelos also used the gun to protect himself while dealing drugs, the possession of these handguns is also covered by § 924(c).[149]\\nMr. Angelos did not engage in force or violence, or threats of force or violence, in furtherance of or in connection with the offenses for which he has been convicted. No offense involved injury to any person or the threat of injury to any person. It is well-established that crimes marked by violence or threat of violence are more serious [150] and that the absence of direct violence affects the strength of society\\'s interest in punishing a particular criminal.[151]\\nIt is relevant on this point that the Sentencing Commission has reviewed crimes like Mr. Angelos\\' and concluded that an appropriate penalty for all of Mr. Angelos\\' crimes is no more than about ten years (121 months).[152] With respect to the firearms conduct specifically, the Commission has concluded that about 24 months (a two-level enhancement) is the appropriate penalty.[153] The views of the Commission are entitled to special weight, because it is a congressionally-established expert agency which can draw on significant data and other resources in determining appropriate sentences. Comparing a recommended sentence of two years to the 55-year enhancement the court must impose strongly suggests not merely disproportionality, but gross disproportionality.\\n\\nB. Comparison to Penalties for Other Offenses\\nThe next Harmelin factor requires comparing Mr. Angelos\\' sentence with the sentences imposed on other criminals in the federal system.[154] Generally, \"[i]f more serious crimes are subject to the same penalty, or to less serious penalties, that is some indication that the punishment at issue may be excessive.\"[155] This factor points strongly in favor of finding that the sentence in this case is excessive. As shown in Tables I and II earlier in this opinion, Mr. Angelos will receive a far longer sentence than those imposed in the federal system for such major crimes as aircraft hijacking, second-degree murder, racial beating inflicting life-threatening injuries, kidnapping, and rape. Indeed, Mr. Angelos will receive a far longer sentence than those imposed for three aircraft hijackings, three second-degree murders, three racial beatings inflicting life-threatening injuries, three kidnappings, and three rapes. Because Mr. Angelos is \"treated in the same manner as, or more severely than, criminals who have committed far more serious crimes,\" [156] it appears that the second factor is satisfied.\\n\\n\\n*1259 C. Comparison to Other Jurisdictions\\nThe final Harmelin factor requires the court to examine \"sentences imposed for the same crime in other jurisdictions.\" [157] Evaluating this factor is also straightforward. Mr. Angelos sentence is longer than he would receive in any of the fifty states. The government commendably concedes this point in its brief, pointing out that in Washington State Mr. Angelos would serve about nine years and in Utah would serve about five to seven years.[158] Accordingly, the court finds that the third factor is satisfied.\\n\\nD. Application of the Harmelin Factors in Light of Davis\\n\\nHaving analyzed the three Harmelin factors, the court believes that they lead to the conclusion that Mr. Angelos\\' sentence violates the Eighth Amendment. But before the court declares the sentence unconstitutional, there is one last obstacle to overcome. The court is keenly aware of its obligation to follow precedent from superior courts\\x97specifically the Tenth Circuit and, of course, the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has considered one case that might be regarded as quite similar to this one. In Hutto v. Davis,[159] the Supreme Court held that two consecutive twenty-year sentences\\x97totaling forty years\\x97for possession of nine ounces of marijuana said to be worth $200 did not violate the Eighth Amendment. If Davis remains good law, it is hard see how the sentence in this case violates the Eighth Amendment. Here, Mr. Angelos was involved in at least two marijuana deals involving $700 and approximately sixteen ounces (one pound) of marijuana. Perhaps currency inflation could equate $700 today with $200 in the 1980\\'s. But as a simple matter of arithmetic, if 40 years in prison for possessing nine ounces marijuana does not violate the Eighth Amendment, it is hard to see how 61 years for distributing sixteen ounces (or more) would do so.\\nThe court is aware of an argument that the 1982 Davis decision has been implicitly overruled or narrowed by the 1983 Solem decision and other more recent pronouncements. For example, Justice Kennedy\\'s concurring opinion in Harmelin, explained that \"[o]ur most recent pronouncement on the subject in Solem appeared to apply a different analysis than in... Davis.\"[160] But the Court apparently continues to view Davis as part of the fabric of the law. Thus, Justice Kennedy\\'s concurrence in Harmelin, after noting the seeming overruling of Davis, went on to discuss Davis along with other cases in distilling various \"common principles\" that control Eighth Amendment analysis.[161] Justice Kennedy also explained in Harmelin that his approach \"takes full account of ... Davis, [a] case[ ] ignored by the dissent.\" [162] More recently, in reviewing California\\'s \"three strikes\" legislation last year, the plurality opinion reviewed Davis as one of a string of cases that guide analysis of Eighth Amendment challenges.[163]\\n*1260 In light of these continued references to Davis, the court believes it is it obligated to follow its holding here. Indeed, in Davis the Supreme Court pointedly reminded district court judges that \"unless we wish anarchy to prevail within the federal judicial system, a precedent of this Court must be followed by the lower federal courts....\" [164] Under Davis, Mr. Angelos\\' sentence is not cruel and unusual punishment. Therefore, his Eighth Amendment challenge must be rejected.\\n\\nV. Calculating the Sentence\\nWith Mr. Angelos\\' constitutional challenges to the 55-year sentence on § 924(c) counts resolved, the remaining issue before the court is the sentence to be imposed on the other counts. Mr. Angelos raises a constitutional challenge to the 78-97 month sentence called for by the Sentencing Guidelines for his thirteen other offenses. He notes that the Guidelines calculation rests on enhancements that were never submitted to the jury, in particular enhancements based on the quantity of drugs involved and the amount of money laundered. Under this court\\'s decision in United States v. Croxford[165] interpreting Blakely v. Washington,[166] these enhancements extend the maximum penalty that can be imposed on Mr. Angelos beyond that supported by the jury\\'s verdict. Croxford explains that the Sixth Amendment as interpreted in Blakely requires jury fact-finding on such issues as drug quantities and dollar values. The court therefore holds that the Guidelines are unconstitutional as applied to Mr. Angelos.\\nWithout the Guidelines, the court is free to make its own determination of what is an appropriate sentence for these thirteen offenses. In making that determination, the court consults the Guidelines as instructive but not binding.[167] If the sentence on these thirteen counts was the only sentence that Mr. Angelos would serve, a sentence of about 78-97 months might well be appropriate. But the court cannot ignore the reality that Mr. Angelos will also be sentenced to 55 years on the § 924(c) counts, far in excess of what is just punishment for all of his crimes. In light of this 55-year sentence, and having considered all of the relevant factors listed in the Sentencing Reform Act,[168] the court will impose a sentence of one day in prison for all offenses other than the § 924(c) counts. Lest anyone think that this is a \"soft\" sentence, in combination with the § 924(c) counts, the result is that Mr. Angelos will not walk outside of prison until after he reaches the age of 70.\\nNot content with a mere 55-year sentence in this case, the government argues that the court may not depart downward from the Guidelines simply because of the penalties imposed by the § 924(c) counts. Its argument rests on United States v. Thornbrugh,[169] in which the Tenth Circuit found it was an abuse of discretion for a district court to depart from the Guidelines because of the harsh effects of § 924(c). But for the reasons articulated in Croxford, the Guidelines no longer bind the court in this case. Therefore, the court need not \"depart\" from the Guidelines to impose a one day sentence, and thus the *1261 analysis of departures in Thornbrugh is not controlling in this case.\\n\\nVI. Recommendations to Other Branches of Government\\nHaving disposed of the legal arguments in this case, it seems appropriate to make some concluding, personal observations. I have been on the bench for nearly twoand-half years now. During that time, I have sentenced several hundred offenders under the Sentencing Guidelines and federal mandatory minimum statutes. By and large, the sentences I have been required to impose have been tough but fair. In a few cases, to be sure, I have felt that either the Guidelines or the mandatory minimums produced excessive punishment. But even in those cases, the sentences seemed to be within the realm of reason.\\nThis case is different. It involves a first offender who will receive a life sentence for crimes far less serious than those committed by many other offenders\\x97including violent offenders and even a murderer\\x97 who have been before me. For the reasons explained in my opinion, I am legally obligated to impose this sentence. But I feel ethically obligated to bring this injustice to the attention of those who are in a position to do something about it.\\n\\nA. Recommendation for Executive Commutation\\nFor all the reasons previously given, an additional 55-year sentence for Mr. Angelos under § 924(c) is unjust, disproportionate to his offense, demeaning to victims of actual criminal violence\\x97but nonetheless constitutional. While I must impose the unjust sentence, our system of separated powers provides a means of redress. The Framers were well aware that \"[t]he administration of justice ... is not necessarily always wise or certainly considerate of circumstances which may properly mitigate guilt.\" [170] In my mind, this is one of those rare cases where the system has malfunctioned. \"To afford a remedy, it has always been thought essential in popular governments, as well as in monarchies, to vest in some other authority than the courts power to ameliorate or avoid particular criminal judgments.\" [171] Under our Constitution, the President has \"the Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States....\" [172] One of the purposes of executive clemency is \"to afford relief from undue harshness.\" [173] This power is absolute. \"The executive can reprieve or pardon all offenses after their commission, either before trial, during trial or after trial, by individuals, or by classes, conditionally or absolutely, and this without modification or regulation by Congress.\" [174]\\nGiven that the President has the exclusive power to commute sentences, the question arises as to whether I have any role to play in commutation decisions, ie., is it appropriate for me to make a commutation recommendation to the President. Having carefully reviewed the issue, I believe that such a recommendation is entirely proper. The President presumably wants the fullest array of information regarding cases in which a commutation might be appropriate. Moreover, the Executive Branch has indicated that it actively solicits the views of sentencing judges on pardon and commutation requests. The Office of the Pardon Attorney in the Department of Justice is responsible for *1262 handling requests for pardons and commutations. According to the U.S. Attorney\\'s Manual Standards for Consideration of Clemency Petitions, the Pardon Attorney \"routinely requests ... the views and recommendations of the sentencing judge\" on any request for commutation.[175]\\nI therefore believe that it is appropriate for me to communicate to the President, through the Office of the Pardon Attorney, my views regarding Mr. Angelos\\' sentence. I recommend that the President commute Mr. Angelos\\' sentence to a prison term of no more than 18 years, the average sentence recommended by the jury that heard this case.[176] The court agrees with the jury that this is an appropriate sentence in this matter in light of all of the other facts discussed in this opinion. The Clerk\\'s Office is directed to forward a copy of this opinion with its commutation recommendation to the Office of Pardon Attorney.\\n\\nB. Recommendation for Legislative Reform\\nWhile a Presidential commutation of Mr. Angelos\\' sentence would resolve his particular case, § 924(c) remains in place and will continue to create injustices in future cases. For the reasons explained in this opinion, the problem stems from the count stacking features of mandatory minimum sentences. In our system of separate powers, general correction of this problem lies in the hands of Congress which is possessed of the \"legislative powers\" granted in the Constitution.[177]\\nAgain, the question arises regarding whether it is appropriate for me to communicate with Congress regarding apparent problems that have arisen in applying the mandatory minimums in this case. Having carefully studied the issue, I conclude that such a communication is proper. As Judge Calabresi on the Second Circuit has noted, \"[t]he tradition of courts engaging in dialogue with legislatures is too well-established in this and other courts to disregard.\"[178] Presumably Congress no less than the President desires feedback on how its statutes are operating. Congress also presumably wants to be informed in situations where its mandates are producing adverse effects, such as demeaning crime victims or risking a possible backlash from citizen juries.\\nJustice Anthony Kennedy recently commented on the roles of courts and legislatures in specific reference to mandatory minimums:\\nThe legislative branch has the obligation to determine whether a policy is wise. It is a grave mistake to retain a policy just because a court finds it constitutional. Courts may conclude the legislature is permitted to choose long sentences, but that does not mean long sentences are wise or just ... A court decision does not excuse the political branches or the public from the responsibility for unjust laws.[179]\\n*1263 This court deals with sentencing matters on a daily basis and feels in a unique position to advise Congress on such matters. Congress itself has recognized the expertise of the judiciary in matters of sentencing by placing the Sentencing Commission in the judicial branch of government. As the Supreme Court noted in Mistretta v. United States,[180] \"sentencing is a field in which the Judicial Branch long has exercised substantive or political judgment.... Congress placed the Commission in the Judicial Branch precisely because of the Judiciary\\'s special knowledge and expertise.\" [181]\\nFor all these reasons, it is appropriate for me to communicate with Congress concerning the need for legislative reform. I express no view on mandatory minimum sentencing schemes in general. But for the reasons discussed in this opinion, one particular feature of the federal scheme\\x97 the \"count stacking\" feature of § 924(c) for first-time offenders\\x97has lead to an unjust result in this case and will lead to unjust results in other cases. Particularly in cases (like this one) that do not involve direct violence, Congress should consider repealing this feature and making § 924(c) a true recidivist statute of the threestrikes-and-you\\'re-out variety. In other words, Congress should consider applying the second and subsequent § 924(c) enhancements only to defendants who have been previously convicted of a serious offense, rather than to first-time offenders like Mr. Angelos. This is an approach to § 924(c) that the Tenth Circuit[182] and Justices Stevens, O\\'Connor, and Blackmun [183] believed Congress intended. It is an approach to sentencing that makes good sense. The Clerk\\'s Office is directed to forward a copy of this opinion to the Chair and Ranking Member of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nThe 55-year sentence mandated by § 924(c) in this case appears to be unjust, cruel, and irrational. But our constitutional system of government requires the court to follow the law, not its own personal views about what the law ought to be. Perhaps the court has overlooked some legal point, and that the appellate courts will find Mr. Angelos\\' sentence invalid. But applying the law as the court understands it, the court sentences Mr. Angelos to serve a term of imprisonment of 55 years and one day. The court recommends that the President commute this unjust sentence and that the Congress modify the laws that produced it. The Clerk\\'s Office is directed to forward a copy of this opinion with its commutation recommendation to the Office of Pardon Attorney and to the Chair and Ranking Member of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees.\\nNOTES\\n[1]  18 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1).\\n[2]  Tr. 9/14/04 at 27 (based on U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(7)§ 2S1.1(b)(2)(B)).\\n[3]  18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(i) & (C)(i).\\n[4]  18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(D)(ii).\\n[5]  ___ U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).\\n[6]  H.R.REP.

It is not clear whether as-applied challenges are permitted in the context of rationality review. After all, \"[n]early any statute which classifies people may be irrational as applied in particular cases.\" Better v. Rumsfeld, 632 F.2d 788, 808-09, n. 20 (9th Cir.1980). Moreover, statutes subject to rational review can be based on \"assumptions\" and \"generalizations\" which \"inevitably produce seemingly arbitrary consequences in some individual cases.\" Califano v. Jobst, 434 U.S. 47, 53, 98 S.Ct. 95, 54 L.Ed.2d 228 (1977). These statutes \"must be judged by reference to characteristics typical of the affected classes rather than by focusing on selected, atypical examples.\" Id. at 55, 98 S.Ct. 95. Thus, in Rojas-Reyes v. INS, 235 F.3d 115 (2d Cir.2000), the court rejected an as-applied challenge because it \"misunderstands the nature of rational basis review, in which acts of Congress . . . need not result in the most just or logical result in every case to pass constitutional muster.\" Id. at 123 (citation omitted).\\n\\nOn the other hand, the Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit have both addressed as-applied challenges under rational basis review without questioning whether the posture of the case was appropriate. See City of Cleburne, Texas v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432, 450, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985) (striking down local zoning ordinance under rational basis review because irrational \"as applied in this case\"); Meyer v.

Doyan, 909 F.2d 412, 416 (10th Cir.1990) (upholding U.S.S.G. § 5E1.2(i) \"as applied here\"). In light of these possibly conflicting approaches and the seriousness of the penalties facing Mr. Angelos, the safest and fairest approach here is to give him the benefit of the doubt and consider his as-applied challenge.\\n[46]  379 F.3d 1208 (10th Cir.2004).\\n[47]  Id. at 1217 (quoting Starlight Sugar, Inc. v.

Angelos now appeals his convictions and sentence. We exercise jurisdiction\\n\\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and affirm.\\n\\n                                             -4-\\n\\x0c                                             I.\\n\\n       In May and June of 2002, the government, with the assistance of a confidential\\n\\ninformant (CI), conducted three controlled purchases of marijuana from Angelos. On\\n\\neach of the three occasions, the CI purchased eight ounces of marijuana from Angelos in\\n\\nexchange for cash. On two of the three occasions, the CI observed Angelos in possession\\n\\nof a 10 millimeter Glock pistol.\\n\\n       Angelos’s involvement in the three controlled purchases led to his indictment by a\\n\\nfederal grand jury on November 13, 2002. The indictment charged Angelos with three\\n\\ncounts of marijuana distribution in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), one count of\\n\\ncarrying or possessing a firearm during or in relation to a drug trafficking crime in\\n\\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), and one count of possessing a firearm with an obliterated\\n\\nserial number in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(k).\\n\\n       Angelos was subsequently arrested on November 15, 2002. A consensual search\\n\\nof Angelos’s apartment produced three pounds of marijuana, three firearms, a large\\n\\namount of cash, and two opiate suckers. A subsequent search at a house leased by\\n\\nAngelos produced, among other things, additional marijuana and several large duffle bags\\n\\nthat contained marijuana residue.\\n\\n       On June 18, 2003, the government obtained a superseding indictment charging\\n\\nAngelos with seventeen criminal counts, including additional marijuana distribution\\n\\ncounts and additional § 924(c) counts. On October 1, 2003, following the completion of a\\n\\ncriminal investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, the government obtained a second\\n\\n\\n                                             -5-\\n\\x0csuperseding indictment charging Angelos with twenty criminal counts, including: six\\n\\ncounts of distributing marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) (Counts 1, 3, 5, 9,\\n\\n13, 15); five counts of possessing a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking\\n\\ncrime in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1) (Counts 2, 4, 10, 14, 16); two counts of\\n\\npossessing a stolen firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(j) (Counts 6, 11); one count of\\n\\npossessing a firearm which had the importer’s and manufacturer’s serial number\\n\\nremoved, obliterated and altered, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(k) (Count 7); three\\n\\ncounts of possessing a firearm while being an unlawful user of controlled substances in\\n\\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(3) (Counts 8, 12, 17); one count of engaging in and\\n\\nattempting to engage in a monetary transaction through or to a financial institution in\\n\\ncriminally derived property in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1957 (Count 18); and two counts\\n\\nof conducting and attempting to conduct financial transactions which involved the\\n\\nproceeds of marijuana distribution in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) (Counts\\n\\n19, 20).\\n\\n       The case proceeded to trial in December 2003, where a jury found Angelos guilty\\n\\nof sixteen counts, including three § 924(c) counts. Following trial, a presentence\\n\\ninvestigation report (PSR) was prepared which recommended that Angelos, who had no\\n\\nprior adult criminal history, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of sixty-one and a\\n\\nhalf (61.5) years, including six and a half (6.5) years for the drug and money laundering\\n\\nconvictions and fifty-five (55) years for the three § 924(c) convictions. After receiving\\n\\nthe PSR, the district court expressed concern about imposing what it characterized as “an\\n\\n\\n                                             -6-\\n\\x0cextraordinarily long prison term,” and thus directed the parties to file briefs addressing a\\n\\nnumber of sentencing-related issues, including whether the mandatory minimum\\n\\nsentences required under § 924(c) were consistent with the Eighth Amendment’s\\n\\nprohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. App. at 106. Angelos argued in\\n\\nresponse that the fifty-five year sentence required to be imposed under § 924(c) violated\\n\\nthe Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Angelos also\\n\\nasserted an Equal Protection challenge to § 924(c).\\n\\n       On November 16, 2004, the district court sentenced Angelos to a term of\\n\\nimprisonment of fifty-five years and one day. In doing so, the district court rejected\\n\\nAngelos’s Eighth Amendment and Equal Protection challenges to his sentence.\\n\\n                                             II.\\n\\n                               Denial of motion to suppress\\n\\n       On December 16, 2002, Chelsea Davenport, Angelos’s former girlfriend, advised\\n\\nlaw enforcement agents that Angelos was hiding drugs, firearms, and money at a rental\\n\\nhouse located at 1701 East Fort Union Boulevard (the Fort Union house) in Salt Lake\\n\\nCity. App. at 35-36. In particular, Davenport advised that she had observed marijuana in\\n\\nthe trunk of a black BMW automobile parked in the garage at the Fort Union house (the\\n\\nsame BMW that Angelos was observed driving when he sold marijuana to the CI), and\\n\\nthat additional drugs, guns, and money were located in a safe in the basement of the Fort\\n\\nUnion house. Id. Based upon this information, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\\n\\nagent Juan Becerra prepared an affidavit in support of a search warrant for the Fort Union\\n\\n\\n                                             -7-\\n\\x0chouse and the BMW. Id. at 35-38. In the affidavit, Becerra stated:\\n\\n       Your Affiant desires to seize the safe belonging to Angelos, [and] the black\\n       1993 BMW 318I used during the sale of drugs to [the CI]. Your Affiant\\n       also requests permission to seize any drug paraphernalia, illegal narcotics,\\n       any proceeds derived from these activities, any photographs, video tapes or\\n       other items pertaining to the sale and distribution of illegal narcotics and\\n       street gang affiliation and activities.\\n\\nId. at 37. Consistent with the practice in the District of Utah, Becerra presented his\\n\\naffidavit to an Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) for preparation of an application\\n\\nfor a search warrant and a proposed search warrant. Unlike the broader language\\n\\ncontained in Becerra’s affidavit, both the application and the proposed search warrant\\n\\nprepared by the AUSA requested permission to seize only “[m]arijuana and other indicia\\n\\nof narcotics in the trunk of the vehicle, 1993 BMW 318i, License Plate #215J3” and the\\n\\n“personal safe located in the basement of the residence containing drugs, firearms, and\\n\\nmoney.” Id. at 34, 40. The proposed search warrant was subsequently signed by a\\n\\nfederal judge.\\n\\n       When law enforcement officers executed the search warrant, they first conducted a\\n\\nprotective sweep of all three floors of the Fort Union house in order to ensure their safety.\\n\\nUpon entering the basement, the officers immediately detected a strong odor of raw\\n\\nmarijuana. The odor seemed to be emanating from approximately eighteen large duffle\\n\\nbags that were in plain view. When the officers looked more closely at the duffle bags,\\n\\nthey observed small amounts of marijuana residue on the exterior of the bags.\\n\\nAccordingly, the officers seized those bags. Six similar duffle bags, that also smelled of\\n\\n\\n\\n                                             -8-\\n\\x0craw marijuana, were located in plain view in the garage of the Fort Union house and\\n\\nseized by the officers. In addition to seizing the duffle bags and the items specifically\\n\\nlisted in the search warrant (i.e., narcotics from the trunk of the BMW and the safe\\n\\nlocated in the basement), the officers executing the warrant seized numerous other items\\n\\nfrom throughout the Fort Union house, including firearms, documents, ammunition, a\\n\\ncomputer, gang-related clothing, and electronic scales.\\n\\n       Angelos moved to suppress the items seized from the Fort Union house. After\\n\\nconducting an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied Angelos’s motion. On appeal,\\n\\nAngelos contends the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress. In reviewing\\n\\nthe district court’s decision, we “view the evidence in the light most favorable to the\\n\\ngovernment, accept the district court’s findings of fact unless clearly erroneous, and\\n\\nreview de novo the ultimate determination of reasonableness under the Fourth\\n\\nAmendment.” United States v. Katoa, 379 F.3d 1203, 1205 (10th Cir. 2004).\\n\\n       a) Exceeding scope of search warrant\\n\\n       Angelos contends, as he did below, that the agents executing the search warrant\\n\\nexceeded the scope of the warrant by seizing items other than those specifically listed in\\n\\nthe warrant. In ruling on Angelos’s motion to suppress, the district court agreed “that the\\n\\nsearch warrant itself authorized only a search of the safe and the car,” and did not extend\\n\\nto the Fort Union house as a whole. App. at 101. However, the district court concluded\\n\\nthat “it was objectively reasonable for the [executing] officers to believe that the warrant\\n\\nauthorized them to search the entire residence.” Id. In reaching this conclusion, the\\n\\n\\n                                             -9-\\n\\x0cdistrict court noted that “the officers specifically sought a warrant to obtain the items\\n\\nspecified in Special Agent Becerra’s affidavit, which plainly established probable cause\\n\\nto search not just the basement for the safe but the entire residence.” Id. Further, the\\n\\ndistrict court noted that “the warrant twice generally stated the location of the search as\\n\\nthe ‘residence/premises: 1701 East Fort Union Blvd, Salt Lake City, Utah 84121,” and\\n\\n“also referred to the affidavit as the basis for probable cause.” Id. These references, the\\n\\ndistrict court concluded, could have led Becerra to reasonably believe that the “warrant\\n\\nauthorized him to search the entire residence.” Id. In sum, the district court concluded “it\\n\\nwas objectively reasonable for the agents to think (and that they did in fact think) that\\n\\nthey had obtained a search warrant to search the entire residence.” Id.\\n\\n       “[T]he Fourth Amendment requires search warrants to ‘particularly describ[e] the\\n\\nplace to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized . . . .’” Katoa, 379 F.3d at\\n\\n1207 (quoting Fourth Amendment). The warrant at issue here met the Fourth\\n\\nAmendment’s particularity requirement by specifying the items to be seized from the Fort\\n\\nUnion house, i.e., “[m]arijuana and other indicia of narcotics in the trunk of the vehicle,\\n\\n1993 BMW 318i, License Plate #215J3” and the “personal safe located in the basement of\\n\\nthe residence containing drugs, firearms, and money.” App. at 34, 40. Further, the\\n\\nwarrant, on its face, contained no constitutional or clerical defects, and there was no\\n\\nambiguity in the terms used in the warrant.\\n\\n       That leads to the question of the precise scope of the warrant. We review de novo\\n\\nthe scope of the search warrant at issue, employing “a standard of practical accuracy\\n\\n                                              -10-\\n\\x0crather than technical precision.” United States v. Ortega-Jiminez, 232 F.3d 1325, 1328\\n\\n(10th Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). Although the district court\\n\\nconcluded that the scope of the warrant was limited to the specific items listed on its face\\n\\n(i.e., the narcotics in the trunk of the BMW and the safe located in the basement), the\\n\\ngovernment contends that the scope of the warrant included the entire Fort Union house.\\n\\nMore specifically, the government asserts that we should adopt “a practical reading of the\\n\\nwarrant” and, in doing so, should allow the warrant to be clarified by the supporting\\n\\naffidavit. Govt. Br. at 84.\\n\\n       In support of its arguments, the government cites to a single case, i.e., Ortega-\\n\\nJiminez. In that case, law enforcement officers obtained a search warrant that authorized\\n\\nthe search of a storage unit and any “persons and vehicles of individuals present and\\n\\narriving” at the unit. 232 F.3d at 1328. In executing the warrant, the officers searched\\n\\nthe person and vehicle of the defendant, who had been detained by authorities and\\n\\nbrought to the storage unit prior to the warrant being issued. The district court, pursuant\\n\\nto the defendant’s motion, suppressed the evidence seized from the defendant and his\\n\\nvehicle, concluding the defendant could not fairly have been considered “present” at the\\n\\nstorage unit because he had been moved there by the police. On appeal, we noted that the\\n\\nterm “present,” as used in the search warrant, “might technically be interpreted to mean\\n\\nthose who are voluntarily present at the time the warrant is signed . . . .” Id. at 1329.\\n\\nHowever, we concluded it was appropriate to “determine the practical meaning of the\\n\\nterm . . . .” Id. (italics in original). In doing so, we turned to the affidavit submitted in\\n\\n                                              -11-\\n\\x0csupport of the warrant, which clearly indicated that the defendant was being detained at\\n\\nthe storage unit. In light of this information, we held that “[a] practical reading of the\\n\\nterm ‘present’ must include those the judge knew actually were present at that time,” and\\n\\nthus the search of the defendant and his vehicle fell “within the scope of the warrant.” Id.\\n\\n       Although Ortega-Jiminez allows a court to adopt a “practical reading” of a\\n\\ndisputed term in a search warrant, it is clear that there are no such terms in the search\\n\\nwarrant at issue here. To the contrary, as noted, the warrant describes with particularity,\\n\\nand without ambiguity, the items to be seized from the Fort Union home. Thus, we\\n\\nconclude that none of the terms in the warrant can be read “with practicality” to\\n\\nencompass the entire premises.\\n\\n       That conclusion, in turn, requires us to decide whether the officers executing the\\n\\nwarrant acted reasonably in exceeding the scope of the warrant and seizing items\\n\\nthroughout the house. Although the government makes reference to the good faith\\n\\nexception announced by the Supreme Court in United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897\\n\\n(1984), we conclude that exception is inapplicable here. In Leon, the Court held that\\n\\nevidence obtained pursuant to a constitutionally defective search warrant is admissible at\\n\\ntrial if the officers executing the search warrant reasonably relied on the warrant and there\\n\\nis no evidence the officers mislead the magistrate issuing the warrant. Id. at 920-21.\\n\\nNotably, the Court in Leon made reference to officers “properly execut[ing] [a] warrant\\n\\nand search[ing] only those places and for those objects that it was reasonable to believe\\n\\nwere covered by the warrant.” 468 U.S. at 918, n.19. In turn, we have held that “[t]he\\n\\n                                             -12-\\n\\x0cLeon good faith exception will not save an improperly executed warrant.” United States\\n\\nv. Rowland, 145 F.3d 1194, 1208 n.10 (10th Cir. 1998). Given the circumstances of the\\n\\nsearch of the Fort Union house, it is apparent that the problem lies in the execution, and\\n\\nnot the constitutionality, of the search warrant.\\n\\n       Angelos contends there are only two possible explanations for why the officers in\\n\\nthis case exceeded the scope of the search warrant: either they “knew the limits of the\\n\\nwarrant and decided to disregard them, or [they] never bothered to read the warrant\\n\\nitself.” Aplt. Br. at 76. Either way, he argues, the officers are not entitled to rely on any\\n\\ntype of good faith exception. We agree. Assuming the agents executing the warrant\\n\\nactually read it, they reasonably should have noticed its limited scope. In turn, the agents\\n\\ncould have, upon realizing that the scope of the warrant was narrower than requested by\\n\\nAgent Becerra, contacted the issuing judge by phone in an attempt to receive\\n\\nauthorization to expand the scope of the search to include the entire premises. See Katoa,\\n\\n379 F.3d at 1208 (upholding search as reasonable where officers executing search, upon\\n\\nrealizing that the warrant contained a defect or omission, made immediate contact with\\n\\nthe issuing magistrate, received authorization for their actions, and the judge signed the\\n\\nwarrant upon the officers’ return). By failing to do so, the officers cannot be said to have\\n\\nacted reasonably.\\n\\n       That leaves only the question of what evidence should have been suppressed.\\n\\nAngelos contends that the proper remedy for the Fourth Amendment violation in this case\\n\\nis suppression of all the evidence seized by the officers, and not just the evidence that\\n\\n\\n                                             -13-\\n\\x0cexceeded the scope of the warrant. Aplt. Br. at 74. He does not, however, provide any\\n\\nauthority to support this remedy. In the absence of such authority, we conclude that only\\n\\nthe seized evidence that exceeded the scope of the search warrant, and that was not\\n\\ncovered by the plain smell/view exception, should have been suppressed. See generally\\n\\nUnited States v. Harris, 313 F.3d 1228, 1233 (10th Cir. 2002) (noting the general rule that\\n\\n“[a]ny evidence obtained as a result of an illegal search and seizure is subject to the\\n\\nexclusionary rule--i.e., the evidence cannot be used in a criminal proceeding against the\\n\\nvictim of the illegal search and seizure.”).\\n\\n       b) Plain smell exception\\n\\n       Angelos contends the district court erred in refusing to suppress the group of duffle\\n\\nbags that were seized by officers from the basement and garage of the Fort Union house\\n\\ndue to the smell of raw marijuana emanating from them. Angelos does not deny that the\\n\\nofficers smelled raw marijuana coming from the duffle bags. Instead, Angelos argues\\n\\nthat, because the officers secured the house by performing a protective sweep, “[t]here\\n\\nwas no exigent circumstance for [them] to rummage through the basement and garage in\\n\\nan attempt to locate the source of the smell.” Aplt. Br. at 81.\\n\\n       We disagree. The “plain view” doctrine allows a law enforcement officer to seize\\n\\nevidence of a crime, without violating the Fourth Amendment, if “(1) the officer was\\n\\nlawfully in a position from which the object seized was in plain view, (2) the object’s\\n\\nincriminating character was immediately apparent (i.e., there was probable cause to\\n\\nbelieve it was contraband or evidence of a crime), and (3) the officer had a lawful right of\\n\\n\\n                                               -14-\\n\\x0caccess to the object.” United States v. Thomas, 372 F.3d 1173, 1178 (10th Cir. 2004); see\\n\\nHorton v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 136-37 (1990). “The ‘plain smell’ doctrine,” in turn,\\n\\n“is simply a logical extension of the ‘plain view’ doctrine . . . .” App. at 102; e.g., United\\n\\nStates v. Rhiger, 315 F.3d 1283, 1290 (10th Cir. 2003) (concluding that various factors,\\n\\nincluding agents’ detection of strong odor of cooking methamphetamine, justified\\n\\nwarrantless search); United States v. Clayton, 210 F.3d 841, 845 (8th Cir. 2000)\\n\\n(concluding that officer executing arrest warrant “quickly developed probable cause for a\\n\\nsearch based on his immediate perception of an odor associated with methamphetamine\\n\\nproduction”); United States v. Haley, 669 F.2d 201, 203 (4th Cir. 1982) (concluding that\\n\\nthe odor given off by a container can justify invocation of the “plain view” doctrine).\\n\\nHere, the district court found, and Angelos does not dispute, that the officers executing\\n\\nthe search warrant (1) were lawfully in the Fort Union house, (2) had lawful authority to\\n\\nconduct a protective sweep of the entire premises, including the garage and basement1, (3)\\n\\nsmelled a strong odor of raw marijuana coming from duffle bags in the basement and\\n\\ngarage, all of which were in plain sight, and (4) observed residue of marijuana on the\\n\\nduffle bags in the basement. We conclude these circumstances, considered together,\\n\\nclearly justified the seizure of the duffle bags.2\\n\\n\\n       1\\n         Although Angelos contends a protective sweep is justified only pursuant to an\\narrest, we have previously upheld a search where the officers conducted a protective\\nsweep of a house which was the subject of a search warrant. See United States v. King,\\n222 F.3d 1280, 1283 (10th Cir. 2000).\\n       2\\n          In its appellate brief, the government argues that several other items, including a\\nrifle, surveillance equipment, body armor, and booby traps “were all discovered and\\n\\n                                              -15-\\n\\x0c       c) Was admission of the suppressible evidence harmless?\\n\\n       The government contends that, even if some of the evidence seized from the Fort\\n\\nUnion house should have been suppressed, its admission at trial was harmless. Because\\n\\nthe error was of constitutional magnitude, we apply the harmless error standard outlined\\n\\nin Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18 (1967). See United States v. Fellers, 397 F.3d\\n\\n1090, 1098 (8th Cir. 2005). The Chapman standard requires the government to\\n\\ndemonstrate that the error was “harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.” 386 U.S. at 24.\\n\\n       After carefully reviewing the record on appeal, including the trial transcript, we\\n\\nagree with the government that the admission of evidence improperly seized during the\\n\\nsearch of the Fort Union house was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. To begin with,\\n\\nwe note that the jury acquitted Angelos on three charges arising out of certain items\\n\\nseized at the Fort Union house: a handgun and a rifle, which formed the basis for two §\\n\\n924(c) charges (Counts 14 and 16 of the second superseding indictment); and marijuana\\n\\nfound in the Fort Union house, which formed the basis of a charge of possessing with\\n\\nintent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) (Count 15 of the second\\n\\nsuperseding indictment). The only count of conviction directly arising out of the search\\n\\nof the Fort Union house was Count 13 of the second superseding indictment, which\\n\\n\\n\\nseized because they were in plain view of the officers.” Govt. Br. at 88. We conclude it\\nis unnecessary to address these arguments in detail, given the strength of the\\ngovernment’s evidence underlying the offenses of conviction. In other words, even\\nassuming these items were not properly seized under the plain view doctrine and should\\nhave been suppressed, we conclude their introduction at trial was harmless beyond a\\nreasonable doubt.\\n\\n                                            -16-\\n\\x0ccharged Angelos with possessing with intent to distribute marijuana located in the trunk\\n\\nof the black BMW parked in the garage of the Fort Union house. As outlined above, the\\n\\nsearch warrant for the Fort Union house specifically listed, as an item to be seized, the\\n\\nmarijuana in the trunk of the BMW. Thus, we find no basis for concluding that this\\n\\nconviction was tainted by introduction of any improperly seized evidence.\\n\\n       It is true that the jury also found Angelos guilty of Count 20 of the second\\n\\nsuperseding indictment, which charged him with violating 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A)(i)\\n\\nin December 2002 by paying rent for the Fort Union house with proceeds of marijuana\\n\\ndistribution with the intent to use the Fort Union house to “store marijuana, cash, and\\n\\nother items related to the distribution of and possession with intent to distribute marijuana\\n\\n. . . .” App. at 23. Our review of the record on appeal, however, leads us to conclude that\\n\\nthe properly admitted evidence in support of this conviction was so substantial “that it\\n\\nassured beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have returned a conviction even\\n\\nabsent” any improperly admitted evidence. Fellers, 397 F.3d at 1099. For example,\\n\\nAngelos’s former girlfriend, Chelsea Davenport, testified that she personally observed\\n\\nAngelos sell marijuana on a daily basis, and that Angelos sometimes did so at the Fort\\n\\nUnion house. Davenport further testified that, on one occasion, she traveled with Angelos\\n\\nand two other individuals to California and returned to Salt Lake City with a trunkload of\\n\\nduffel bags containing marijuana. Eric Lerohl, an FBI agent who was involved in the\\n\\nsearch of the Fort Union house, testified that the entire house emitted a very distinct odor\\n\\nof raw marijuana. Together, the testimony of Davenport and Lerohl was more than ample\\n\\n\\n                                            -17-\\n\\x0cto have allowed the jury to reasonably conclude that the duffle bags seized during the\\n\\nsearch of the Fort Union house, which smelled of raw marijuana and contained marijuana\\n\\nresidue, were the same duffle bags used by Angelos to transport marijuana from\\n\\nCalifornia to Salt Lake City. In light of this evidence, the admission of any items\\n\\nimproperly seized from the Fort Union house was merely cumulative and, in our view,\\n\\nharmless. In other words, any improperly seized evidence was not critical to the jury’s\\n\\nfinding that Angelos utilized the Fort Union house for his marijuana-trafficking activities.\\n\\n       Lastly, we conclude that the evidence in support of Angelos’s remaining\\n\\nconvictions was so substantial that it rendered harmless the admission of any evidence\\n\\nimproperly seized from the Fort Union house. In particular, we note that the evidence in\\n\\nsupport of Angelos’s § 924(c) convictions was overwhelming. The first two of those\\n\\nconvictions were tied to Angelos’s possession of a 10 millimeter Glock pistol during the\\n\\nfirst and second controlled purchases. At trial, the CI testified that during the first\\n\\ncontrolled purchase Angelos had the pistol tucked between the front seats of his vehicle,\\n\\nand during the second controlled purchase was wearing the pistol in an ankle holster.\\n\\nSergeant Mazuran in turn testified that the CI reported these same observations\\n\\nimmediately following each of the first two controlled purchases. Christopher Maez and\\n\\nScott Hansen, deputies with the Salt Lake County Sheriff’s Office, testified that on July\\n\\n10, 2002, they responded to a fight involving Angelos and, during the course of\\n\\ninvestigating the incident, seized a 10 millimeter Glock pistol that Angelos was wearing\\n\\nin an ankle holster. Lastly, Chelsea Davenport, Angelos’s former girlfriend, testified that,\\n\\n\\n                                             -18-\\n\\x0cduring the course of their relationship, Angelos consistently carried a black gun in an\\n\\nankle holster, particularly when selling drugs. Together, this evidence overwhelmingly\\n\\nsupported the jury’s findings that Angelos knowingly carried and possessed the pistol\\n\\nduring the first and second controlled purchases. Angelos’s third § 924(c) conviction was\\n\\nbased upon three weapons seized during the post-arrest search of his apartment. Notably,\\n\\nAngelos does not dispute that he possessed those weapons. Nor does he seriously dispute\\n\\nthat he used that apartment for the distribution of drugs. Thus, we conclude that the\\n\\nadmission of evidence improperly seized from the Fort Union house was harmless with\\n\\nrespect to this final § 924(c) conviction.\\n\\n                       District court’s refusal to admit police reports\\n\\n       Angelos contends the district court erred in refusing to admit contemporaneous\\n\\nlaw enforcement reports of the first two controlled purchases. Although Angelos was\\n\\ncharged with and convicted of possessing a firearm during those first two transactions,\\n\\nAngelos asserts that the contemporaneous law enforcement reports of those two\\n\\ntransactions contained no mention of a firearm and thus were relevant and admissible.\\n\\nWe review a district court’s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. United States v.\\n\\nMontague, 421 F.3d 1099, 1101 (10th Cir. 2005). Under that standard, we will reverse\\n\\n“only for a clearly erroneous finding of fact or an erroneous conclusion of law or . . . a\\n\\nclear error in judgment.” Id. at 1102 (internal quotation marks omitted).\\n\\n       At trial, the law enforcement officer who drafted the contemporaneous reports,\\n\\nSergeant Mazuran, testified on direct examination that, immediately following the first\\n\\n\\n                                             -19-\\n\\x0ctwo transactions, the CI reported observing Angelos in possession of a gun (the CI\\n\\nlikewise testified to the same thing). On cross-examination by Angelos’s counsel,\\n\\nMazuran admitted that he failed to include this information in the contemporaneous\\n\\nreports he prepared. In light of Mazuran’s testimony, the admission of the reports\\n\\nthemselves would have been only cumulative. Indeed, at one point during the trial,\\n\\nAngelos’s counsel, in response to the district court’s question whether he was seeking to\\n\\nadmit the reports, stated that he wanted the reports admitted but did not want them to go\\n\\nto the jury. Aplee. App. at 569. Although Angelos’s counsel subsequently changed his\\n\\nmind and asked for the reports to be admitted, the district court rejected that request and\\n\\nAngelos’s counsel made no attempt to explain why the reports were admissible or to\\n\\nquestion the district court’s ruling. Accordingly, we conclude the district court did not\\n\\nabuse its discretion in refusing to admit the reports.\\n\\n                   Eighth Amendment challenge to Angelos’s sentences\\n\\n       Angelos, joined in an amicus brief filed by a group of individuals, including\\n\\nformer federal judges, United States Attorneys General, and high-ranking United States\\n\\nDepartment of Justice officials, contends the district court erred in concluding that the\\n\\nfifty-five year sentence mandated in his case by § 924(c) did not violate the Eighth\\n\\nAmendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. We review de novo the\\n\\nquestion of whether a criminal sentence violates the Eighth Amendment. E.g., United\\n\\nStates v. Fernandez, 388 F.3d 1199, 1258 (9th Cir. 2004); United States v. Myers, 280\\n\\nF.3d 407, 416 (4th Cir. 2002).\\n\\n\\n                                             -20-\\n\\x0c       “The Eighth Amendment . . . contains a ‘narrow proportionality principle’ that\\n\\n‘applies to noncapital sentences.’” Ewing v. California, 538 U.S. 11, 20 (2003) (quoting\\n\\nHarmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 996-97 (1991)). Under this narrow proportionality\\n\\nprinciple, the Eighth Amendment “does not require strict proportionality between crime\\n\\nand sentence.” Id. at 23. “Rather, it forbids only extreme sentences that are ‘grossly\\n\\ndisproportionate’ to the crime.” Id. (quoting Harmelin, 501 U.S. at 1001 (Kennedy, J.,\\n\\nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment)).\\n\\n       Although the Supreme Court has reviewed Eighth Amendment challenges to a\\n\\nnumber of state and federal sentences, it has struck down only two of them over the past\\n\\ncentury. In Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 367 (1910), the Court invalidated\\n\\nunder the Eighth Amendment a sentence of fifteen years in chains and at hard labor, plus\\n\\npermanent surveillance and civil disabilities, for the crime of falsifying a public\\n\\ndocument. Seventy-three years later, in Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S. 277 (1983), the Court\\n\\ninvalidated under the Eighth Amendment a sentence of life imprisonment without the\\n\\npossibility of parole imposed under South Dakota law against a nonviolent recidivist\\n\\nwhose final crime was writing a “no account” check with the intent to defraud.\\n\\n       In contrast to these two cases, the Supreme Court has rejected Eighth Amendment\\n\\nchallenges to the following sentences:\\n\\n       • A life sentence, with the possibility of parole, under a Texas recidivist\\n       statute for successive convictions of (1) fraudulent use of a credit card to\\n       obtain $80 worth of goods or services, (2) passing a forged check in the\\n       amount of $28.36, and (3) obtaining $120.75 by false pretenses. Rummel v.\\n       Estelle, 445 U.S. 263, 285 (1980).\\n\\n\\n                                             -21-\\n\\x0c       • A forty-year sentence for possession and distribution of 9 ounces of\\n       marijuana. Hutto v. Davis, 454 U.S. 370, 375 (1982).\\n\\n       • A life sentence, without the possibility of parole, for possession of more\\n       than 650 grams of cocaine. Harmelin, 501 U.S. at 1005.\\n\\n       • A twenty-five year to life sentence imposed under a California recidivist\\n       statute for the offense of felony grand theft (i.e., stealing three golf clubs\\n       worth approximately $1,200). Ewing, 538 U.S. at 30-31.\\n\\n       • Two consecutive twenty-five-year to life sentences under a California\\n       recidivist statute for two counts of petty theft. Lockyer v. Andrade, 538\\n       U.S. 63, 77 (2003).\\n\\nConsidered together, these cases clearly support the Supreme Court’s recent statement in\\n\\nAndrade that “[t]he gross disproportionality principle reserves a constitutional violation\\n\\nfor only the extraordinary case.” 538 U.S. at 76.\\n\\n       Applying these principles to the case at hand, we conclude that this is not an\\n\\n“extraordinary” case in which the sentences at issue are “grossly disproportionate” to the\\n\\ncrimes for which they were imposed. The Supreme Court has noted that the “basic\\n\\npurpose” of § 924(c) is “to combat the ‘dangerous combination’ of ‘drugs and guns.’”\\n\\nMuscarello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125, 126 (1998) (quoting Smith v. United States,\\n\\n508 U.S. 223, 240 (1993)). The Court has also noted that “the provision’s chief\\n\\nlegislative sponsor . . . said that the provision seeks ‘to persuade the man who is tempted\\n\\nto commit a Federal felony to leave his gun at home.’” Id. (quoting 114 Cong. Rec.\\n\\n22231 (1968) (Rep. Poff)). In addition, the Court has concluded that it was entirely\\n\\nrational for Congress to penalize the mere presence of a firearm during a drug transaction:\\n\\n“Whether guns are used as the medium of exchange for drugs sold illegally or as a means\\n\\n\\n                                             -22-\\n\\x0cto protect the transaction or dealers, their introduction into the scene of drug transactions\\n\\ndramatically heightens the danger to society.” Smith, 508 U.S. at 239 (internal quotation\\n\\nmarks omitted). In this same vein, the Third Circuit has held that “[i]t is likely that\\n\\nCongress,” in enacting § 924(c), “meant . . . to protect our communities from violent\\n\\ncriminals who repeatedly demonstrate a willingness to employ deadly weapons by\\n\\npunishing them more harshly.” United States v. Couch, 291 F.3d 251, 255 (3d Cir. 2002).\\n\\nIn sum, the lengthy sentences mandated by § 924(c) were intended by Congress to (a)\\n\\nprotect society by incapacitating those criminals who demonstrate a willingness to\\n\\nrepeatedly engage in serious felonies while in possession of firearms, and (b) to deter\\n\\ncriminals from possessing firearms during the course of certain felonies. Notably, both of\\n\\nthese penological theories have been held by the Supreme Court to be valid and subject to\\n\\ndeference by the courts. See Ewing, 538 U.S. at 24-28; Harmelin, 501 U.S. at 998-99.\\n\\n       Although Angelos attempts to downplay the nature of his crimes, the record on\\n\\nappeal clearly supports the jury’s findings that Angelos possessed a handgun during the\\n\\ncourse of the first two controlled purchases, and likewise possessed firearms at his\\n\\napartment in conjunction with drug-trafficking materials. All of these firearms appear to\\n\\nhave facilitated his drug trafficking by, if nothing else, providing protection from\\n\\npurchasers and others. Although Angelos emphasizes that he never used any of the\\n\\nfirearms, his possession of the firearms clearly heightened the threat of danger to society.\\n\\nIn particular, it undoubtedly increased the likelihood of violence occurring to neighbors in\\n\\nand around the residences where the firearms were maintained, as well as to others that\\n\\n\\n                                             -23-\\n\\x0chappened to be in the vicinity of wherever he chose to conduct his drug transactions.\\n\\n       It is also important to note that Angelos’s possession of firearms facilitated his\\n\\npossession and distribution of illegal drugs. In Harmelin, the Supreme Court emphasized\\n\\nthe seriousness of drug trafficking crimes, noting that the “[p]ossession, use, and\\n\\ndistribution of illegal drugs represent ‘one of the greatest problems affecting the health\\n\\nand welfare of our population.’” 501 U.S. at 1002 (quoting Treasury Employees v. Von\\n\\nRaab, 489 U.S. 656, 668 (1989)). In particular, “drugs relate to crime in at least three\\n\\nways: (1) A drug user may commit crime because of drug-induced changes in\\n\\nphysiological functions, cognitive ability, and mood; (2) A drug user may commit crime\\n\\nin order to obtain money to buy drugs; and (3) A violent crime may occur as part of the\\n\\ndrug business or culture.” Id. at 1002. Thus, as in Harmelin, Angelos’s “suggestion that\\n\\nhis crime was nonviolent . . . is false to the point of absurdity.” Id. at 1002. “To the\\n\\ncontrary,” his “crime[s] threatened to cause grave harm to society.” Id.\\n\\n       Thus, Congress “could with reason conclude that the threat posed to the individual\\n\\nand society” by possessing firearms in connection with serious felonies, in particular\\n\\ndrug-trafficking crimes, was “momentous enough to warrant the deterrence and\\n\\nretribution” of lengthy consecutive sentences, such as those imposed on Angelos in this\\n\\ncase. Id. at 1003. In turn, that is enough to conclude that the sentences imposed on\\n\\nAngelos are not grossly disproportionate to his crimes. Id. at 1004 (“The severity of\\n\\npetitioner’s crimes brings his [life sentence without parole] within the constitutional\\n\\nboundaries established by our prior decisions.”).\\n\\n\\n                                             -24-\\n\\x0c       The district court reached this same conclusion, but took a somewhat different\\n\\nroute. The district court initially concluded that it was required to examine three\\n\\n“factors” first mentioned in Justice Powell’s dissenting opinion in Davis, and\\n\\nsubsequently discussed in Solem and Harmelin: “(1) the nature of the crime and its\\n\\nrelation to the punishment imposed, (2) the punishment for other offenses in this\\n\\njurisdiction, and (3) the punishment for similar offenses in other jurisdictions.” App. at\\n\\n175. Applying these factors, the district court concluded that “the 55-year enhancement”\\n\\nit was required to impose pursuant to § 924(c) was grossly disproportionate to the crimes\\n\\ncommitted by Angelos. Id. at 177. In support of this conclusion, the district court stated\\n\\nthat Angelos “did not engage in force or violence, or threats of force or violence . . . .” Id.\\n\\nFurther, the district court noted that, under the Sentencing Guidelines, the penalty for\\n\\nAngelos’s “firearms conduct” would be “about 24 months . . . .” Id. With respect to the\\n\\nsecond “factor,” the district court concluded that § 924(c) effectively treated Angelos “in\\n\\nthe same manner as, or more severely than, criminals who have committed far more\\n\\nserious crimes.” Id. at 178 (internal quotation marks omitted). With respect to the third\\n\\nfactor, the district court concluded that Angelos’s sentence under § 924(c) was “longer\\n\\nthan he would receive in any of the fifty states.” Id. In sum, the district court concluded\\n\\nthat analysis of these three factors led “to the conclusion that . . . Angelos’ sentence\\n\\nviolate[d] the Eighth Amendment.” Id. at 179. However, the district court concluded that\\n\\nthe Supreme Court’s decision in Davis prevented it from declaring Angelos’s sentence\\n\\nviolative of the Eighth Amendment. Id. More specifically, the district court noted that “if\\n\\n\\n                                             -25-\\n\\x0c40 years in prison for possessing nine ounces of marijuana d[id] not violate the Eighth\\n\\nAmendment, it [wa]s hard to see how 61 years [the sentence urged by the government in\\n\\nthis case] for distributing sixteen ounces (or more) would do so.” Id.\\n\\n       Angelos argues that the district court erred in concluding that the Supreme Court’s\\n\\ndecision in Davis remains good law and in turn concluding that the decision in Davis\\n\\nrequired the district court to reject Angelos’s Eighth Amendment challenge to his\\n\\nsentence. The flaw in Angelos’s argument is his assertion that Davis is no longer good\\n\\nlaw. Although the Court in Davis rejected application of the three-factor test later\\n\\ndiscussed in Solem and Harmelin, it is the ultimate holding in that case (i.e., that a forty-\\n\\nyear sentence for a marijuana trafficking crime does not violate the Eighth Amendment)\\n\\nthat remains important. Further, the Supreme Court has continued to recognize and\\n\\ndiscuss Davis anytime it has been faced with an Eighth Amendment challenge to a\\n\\nsentence – thereby clearly indicating that the holding in Davis remains “good law.”\\n\\n       The amici “suggest that once [Harmelin’s] three factor test has been satisfied, the\\n\\nanalysis ends, and a finding that a sentence is unconstitutional under Harmelin is not\\n\\ninconsistent with Davis.” This suggestion, however, is only partially correct. As noted in\\n\\nHawkins v. Hargett, 200 F.3d 1279, 1282 (10th Cir. 1999), “Justice Kennedy’s opinion in\\n\\nHarmelin . . . sets forth the applicable Eighth Amendment proportionality test.” Under\\n\\nthat test, a court first examines whether the sentence at issue is grossly disproportionate to\\n\\nthe crime for which it was imposed. Id. If there is no gross disproportionality, that is the\\n\\nend of the analysis; only if gross disproportionality is found must a court “proceed to the\\n\\n\\n                                             -26-\\n\\x0ccomparative analyses” of the second and third factors. Id.\\n\\n       Importantly, however, that does not change the outcome here because, for the\\n\\nreasons discussed in detail above, it is clear that the first, and controlling, “factor” in\\n\\nHarmelin, i.e., whether the sentence at issue is grossly disproportionate to the crime, has\\n\\nnot been satisfied. Although the district court concluded that Angelos’s sentence was\\n\\ndisproportionate to his crimes, we disagree. In our view, the district court failed to accord\\n\\nproper deference to Congress’s decision to severely punish criminals who repeatedly\\n\\npossess firearms in connection with drug-trafficking crimes, and erroneously downplayed\\n\\nthe seriousness of Angelos’s crimes. Although it is true that Angelos had no significant\\n\\nadult criminal history, that appears to have been the result of good fortune rather than\\n\\nAngelos’s lack of involvement in criminal activity. The evidence presented by the\\n\\ngovernment at trial clearly established that Angelos was a known gang member who had\\n\\nlong used and sold illicit drugs. Further, the government’s evidence established that, at\\n\\nthe time of his arrest, Angelos was a mid-to-high drug dealer who purchased and in turn\\n\\nsold large quantities of marijuana. In addition, the government’s evidence established\\n\\nthat Angelos possessed and used a number of firearms, some stolen, to facilitate his drug-\\n\\ndealing acitivities. Lastly, the evidence established that although Angelos had some\\n\\ninvolvement in the music industry, he failed to financially profit from that involvement\\n\\nand indeed never reported any positive earnings to the Internal Revenue Service. Thus,\\n\\nthe only reasonable inference that could be drawn was that Angelos’s sole source of\\n\\nincome was his drug-trafficking operations.\\n\\n\\n                                              -27-\\n\\x0c       In sum, we conclude there is no merit to Angelos’s Eighth Amendment challenge\\n\\nto his sentence under § 924(c). See United States v. Beverly, 369 F.3d 516, 537 (6th Cir.\\n\\n2003) (rejecting Eighth Amendment challenge to § 924(c) sentences and noting that “the\\n\\nSupreme Court has never held that a sentence to a specific term of years, even if it might\\n\\nturn out to be more than the reasonable life expectancy of the defendant, constitutes cruel\\n\\nand unusual punishment.”).\\n\\n                    Equal Protection challenge to Angelos’s sentences\\n\\n       Angelos also challenges his sentence on Equal Protection grounds, arguing that his\\n\\nsentence is the product of “an irrational legislative scheme that implicates the judicial\\n\\nbranch’s core duty of criminal sentencing and entails incomparable consequences for the\\n\\nindividual defendant.” Aplt. Br. at 8. We review constitutional challenges to a sentence\\n\\nde novo. United States v. Eaton, 260 F.3d 1232, 1236 (10th Cir. 2001).\\n\\n       The parties in this case appear to agree that the appropriate level of scrutiny to be\\n\\napplied in resolving Angelos’s Equal Protection claim is the rational basis test, since\\n\\nAngelos has not alleged a discriminatory intent on the part of Congress in enacting the\\n\\nmandatory minimum sentencing scheme outlined in § 924(c). To pass muster under the\\n\\nrational basis test, § 924(c) must “have a legitimate purpose,” and it must have been\\n\\n“reasonable for the lawmakers to believe that use of the challenged classification would\\n\\npromote that purpose.” Western & Southern Life Ins. Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization,\\n\\n451 U.S. 648, 668 (1981).\\n\\n       Section 924(c) easily survives the rational basis test.

Clearly, this purpose is legitimate, given the\\n\\nrecognized negative impact drugs and violence have upon society. Further, it was well\\n\\nwithin reason for Congress to believe that use of the mandatory minimum sentencing\\n\\nscheme outlined in § 924(c) would achieve this basic purpose by (a) incapacitating those\\n\\ncriminals willing to possess firearms during drug-trafficking crimes, and (b) deterring\\n\\nother criminals from engaging in such dangerous conduct. See generally Chapman v.\\n\\nUnited States, 500 U.S. 453, 467 (1991) (“Congress has the power to define criminal\\n\\npunishments without giving the courts any sentencing discretion.”).\\n\\n                            Alternative construction of § 924(c)\\n\\n       Lastly, Angelos contends the district court could have avoided any constitutional\\n\\nproblems by interpreting § 924(c) so as to treat his three marijuana distribution\\n\\nconvictions as a “grouping of related acts,” and in turn applying “only the 5-year\\n\\nmandatory minimum sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(2)(A)(i).” Aplt. Br. at 63.\\n\\nAngelos’s contention, however, finds no support in the language of § 924(c). Section\\n\\n924(c) provides enhanced penalties for “any person who, during and in relation to any . . .\\n\\ndrug trafficking crime . . . for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the\\n\\nUnited States, uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime,\\n\\npossesses a firearm . . . .” 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A). Section 924(c) defines the term\\n\\n“drug trafficking crime” as “any felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act .\\n\\n. , the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act . . , or the Maritime Drug Law\\n\\n\\n                                            -29-\\n\\x0cEnforcement Act . . . .” 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(2). A defendant’s first conviction under §\\n\\n924(c) carries a mandatory minimum five-year sentence that must run consecutively to\\n\\nany other sentences. 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A)(i). A second or subsequent conviction\\n\\nunder § 924(c) carries a mandatory minimum twenty-five year sentence that must run\\n\\nconsecutively to any other sentences. 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(C)(i). Here, it is undisputed\\n\\nthat Angelos was convicted of three separate violations of § 924(c), each occurring on a\\n\\ndifferent date, and each in connection with a separate “drug trafficking crime.” In light of\\n\\nthose three convictions, § 924(c) clearly mandated the imposition of a fifty-five year\\n\\nsentence (five years for the first conviction, and twenty-five years for the second and third\\n\\nconvictions).\\n\\n       AFFIRMED.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                            -30-\\n\\x0c\"}]\n",

The indictment did not allege and no attempt was made to show that the firearms involved had been possessed 'in commerce or affecting commerce,' the Government contending that the statute does not require proof of a connection with interstate commerce in individual cases involving possession or receipt. Doubting its constitutionality if the statute were thus construed, the Court of Appeals reversed. Held: It is not clear from the language and legislative history of § 1202(a)(1) whether or not receipt or possession of a firearm by a convicted felon has to be shown in an individual prosecution to have been connected with interstate commerce. The ambiguity of this provision (which is not only a criminal statute but one whose broad construction would define as a federal offense conduct readily proscribed by the States), must therefore be resolved in favor of the narrower reading that a nexus with interstate commerce must be shown with respect to all three offenses embraced by the provision. Pp. 339—351.\\n434 F.2d 1296, affirmed.\\nRoger A. Pauley, Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\\nWilliam E. Hellerstein, New York City, for respondent.\\nMr. Justice MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n\\n\\n1\\nRespondent was convicted in the Southern District of New York of possessing firearms in violation of Title VII of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C.App. § 1202(a). In pertinent part, that statute reads:\\n\\n\\n2\\n'Any person who—\\n\\n\\n3\\n(1) has been convicted by a court of the United States or of      a State or any political subdivision thereof of a felony . .      . and who receives, possesses, or transports in commerce or      affecting commerce . . . any firearm shall be fined not more      than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than two years, or      both.'1\\n\\n\\n4\\nThe evidence showed that respondent, who had previously been convicted of a felony in New York State, possessed on separate occasions a pistol and then a shotgun. There was no allegation in the indictment and no attempt by the prosecution to show that either firearm had been possessed 'in commerce or affecting commerce.' The Government proceeded on the assumption that § 1202(a) (1) banned all possessions and receipts of firearms by convicted felons, and that no connection with interstate commerce had to be demonstrated in individual cases.\\n\\n\\n5\\nAfter his conviction,2 respondent unsuccessfully moved for arrest of judgment on two primary grounds: that the statute did not reach possession of a firearm not shown to have been 'in commerce or affecting commerce,' and that, if it did, Congress had overstepped its constitutional powers under the Commerce Clause. 308 F.Supp. 1385. The Court of Appeals reversed the conviction, being of the view that if the Government's construction of the statute were accepted, there would be substantial doubt about the statute's constitutionality. 434 F.2d 1296 (CA 2). We granted certiorari, 401 U.S. 993, 91 S.Ct. 1234, 28 L.Ed.2d 530 to resolve a conflict among lower courts over the proper reach of the statute.3 We affirm the judgment of the court below, but for substantially different reasons.4 We conclude that § 1202 is ambiguous in the critical respect. Because its sanctions are criminal and because, under the Government's broader reading, the statute would mark a major inroad into a domain traditionally left to the States, we refuse to adopt the broad reading in the absence of a clearer direction from Congress.\\n\\n\\n6\\n* Not wishing 'to give point to the quip that only when legislative history is doubtful do you go to the statute,'5 we begin by looking to the text itself. The critical textual question is whether the statutory phrase 'in commerce or affecting commerce' applies to 'possesses' and 'receives' as well as to 'transports.' If it does, then the Government must prove as an essential element of the offense that a possession, receipt, or transportation was 'in commerce or affecting commerce'—a burden not undertaken in this prosecution for possession.\\n\\n\\n7\\nWhile the statute does not read well under either view, 'the natural construction of the language' suggests that the clause 'in commerce or affecting commerce' qualifies all three antecedents in the list. Porto Rico Railway Light & Power Co. v. Mor, 253 U.S. 345, 348, 40 S.Ct. 516, 518, 64 L.Ed. 944 (1920). Since 'in commerce or affecting commerce' undeniably applies to at least one antecedent, and since it makes sense with all three, the more plausible construction here is that it in fact applies to all three. But although this is a beginning, the argument is certainly neither overwhelming nor decisive.6\\n\\n\\n8\\nIn a more significant respect, however, the language of the statute does provide support for respondent's reading. Undeniably, the phrase 'in commerce or affecting commerce' is part of the 'transports' offense. But if that phrase applies only to 'transports,' the statute would have a curious reach. While permitting transportation of a firearm unless it is transported 'in commerce or affecting commerce,' the statute would prohibit all possessions of firearms, and both interstate and intrastate receipts. Since virtually all transportations, whether interstate or intrastate, involve an accompanying possession or receipt, it is odd indeed to argue that on the one hand the statute reaches all possessions and receipts, and on the other hand outlaws only interstate transportations. Even assuming that a person can 'transport' a firearm under the statute without possessing or receiving it, there is no reason consistent with any discernible purpose of the statute to apply an interstate commerce requirement to the 'transports' offense alone.7 In short, the Government has no convincing explanation for the inclusion of the clause 'in commerce or affecting commerce' if that phrase only applies to the word 'transports.' It is far more likely that the phrase was meant to apply to 'possesses' and 'receives' as well as 'transports.' As the court below noted, the inclusion of such a purase 'mirror(s) the approach to federal criminal jurisdiction reflected in many other federal statutes.'8\\n\\n\\n9\\nNevertheless, the Government argues that its reading is to be preferred because the defendant's narrower interpretation would make Title VII redundant with Title IV of the same Act. Title IV, inter alia, makes it a crime for four categories of people—including those convicted of a crime punishable for a term exceeding one year—'to ship or transport any firearm or ammunition in interstate or foreign commerce . . . (or) to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.' 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) and (h). As Senator Long, the sponsor of Title VII, represented to Senator Dodd, the sponsor of Title IV, Title VII indeed does complement Title IV. 114 Cong.Rec. 14774; see also 114 Cong.Rec. 16286. Respondent's reading of Title VII is fully consistent with this view. First, although subsections of the two Titles do address their prohibitions to some of the same people, each statute also reaches substantial groups of people not reached by the other.9 Secondly, Title VII complements Title IV by punishing a broader class of behavior. Even under respondent's view, a Title VII offense is made out if the firearm was possessed or received 'in commerce or affecting commerce'; however, Title IV apparently does not reach possessions or intrastate transactions at all, even those with an interstate commerce nexus, but is limited to the sending or receiving of firearms as part of an interstate transportation.10\\n\\n\\n10\\nIn addition, whatever reading is adopted, Title VII and Title IV are, in part, redundant. The interstate commerce requirement in Title VII minimally applies to transportation. Since Title IV also prohibits convicted criminals from transporting firearms in interstate commerce, the two Titles overlap under both readings. The Government's broader reading of Title VII does not eliminate the redundancy, but simply creates a larger area in which there is no overlap. While the Government would be on stronger ground if its reading were necessary to give Title VII some unique and independent thrust, this is not the case here. In any event, circumstances surrounding the passage of Title VII make plain that Title VII was not carefully molded to complement Title IV. Title VII was a last-minute Senate amendment to the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act. The Amendment was hastily passed, with little discussion, no hearings and no report.11 The notion that it was enacted to dovetail neatly with Title IV rests perhaps on a conception of the model legislative process; but we cannot pretend that all statutes are model statutes. While courts should interpret a statute with an eye to the surrounding statutory landscape and an ear for harmonizing potentially discordant provisions, these guiding principles are not substitutes for congressional lawmaking. In our view, no conclusion can be drawn from Title IV concerning the correct interpretation of Title VII.\\n\\n\\n11\\nOther aspects of the meager legislative history, however, do provide some significant support for the Government's interpretation. On the Senate floor, Senator Long, who introduced § 1202, described various evils that prompted his statute. These evils included assassinations of public figures and threats to the operation of businesses significant enough in the aggregate to affect commerce.12 Such evils, we note, would be most thoroughly mitigated by forbidding every possession of any firearm by specified classes of especially risky people, regardless of whether the gun was possessed, received, or transported 'in commerce or affecting commerce.' In addition, specific remarks of the Senator can be read to state that the amendment reaches the mere possession of guns without any showing of an interstate commerce nexus.13 But Senator Long never specifically says that no connection with commerce need be shown in the individual case. And nothing in his statements explains why, if an interstate commerce nexus is irrelevant in individual cases, the phrase 'in commerce or affecting commerce' is in the statute at all.14 But even if Senator Long's remarks were crystal clear to us, they were apparently not crystal clear to his congressional colleagues. Meager as the discussion of Title VII was, one of the few Congressmen who discussed the amendment summarized Title VII as 'mak(ing) it a Federal crime to take, possess, or receive a firearm across State lines . . ..' 114 Cong.Rec. 16298 (statement of Rep. Pollock).\\n\\n\\n12\\nIn short, 'the legislative history of (the) Act hardly speaks with that clarity of purpose which Congress supposedly furnishes courts in order to enable them to enforce its true will.' Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 483, 71 S.Ct. 456, 462, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). Here, as in other cases, the various remarks by legislators 'are sufficiently ambiguous, insofar as this narrow issue is concerned . . . to invite mutually destructive dialectic,' and not much more. FCC v. Columbia Broadcasting System, 311 U.S. 132, 136, 61 S.Ct. 152, 154, 85 L.Ed. 87 (1940). Taken together, the statutory materials are inconclusive on the central issue of whether or not the statutory phrase 'in commerce or affecting commerce' applies to 'possesses' and 'receives' as well as 'transports.' While standing alone, the legislative history might tip in the Government's favor, the respondent explains far better the presence of critical language in the statute. The Government concedes that 'the statute is not a model of logic or clarity.' Pet. for Cert. 5. After 'seiz(ing) every thing from which aid can be derived,' United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch 358, 386, 2 L.Ed. 304 (1805) (Marshall, C.J.), we are left with an ambiguous statute.\\n\\nII\\n\\n13\\nGiven this ambiguity, we adopt the narrower reading: the phrase 'in commerce or affecting commerce' is part of all three offenses, and the present conviction must be set aside because the Government has failed to show the requisite nexus with interstate commerce. This result is dictated by two wise principles this Court has long followed.\\n\\n\\n14\\nFirst, as we have recently reaffirmed, 'ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.' Rewis v. United States, 401 U.S. 808, 812, 91 S.Ct. 1056, 1059, 28 L.Ed.2d 493 (1971). See also Ladner v. United States, 358 U.S. 169, 177, 79 S.Ct. 209, 213, 3 L.Ed.2d 199 (1958); Bell v. United States, 349 U.S. 81, 75 S.Ct. 620, 99 L.Ed. 905 (1955); United States v. Five Gambling Devices, etc., 346 U.S. 441, 74 S.Ct. 190, 98 L.Ed. 179 (1953) (plurality opinion for affirmance). In various ways over the years, we have stated that 'when choice has to be made between two readings of what conduct Congress has made a crime, it is appropriate, before we choose the harsher alternative, to require that Congress should have spoken in language that is clear and definite.' United States v. Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp., 344 U.S. 218, 221—222, 73 S.Ct. 227, 229, 97 L.Ed. 260 (1952). This principle is founded on two policies that have long been part of our tradition. First, 'a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed. To make the warning fair, so fair as possible the line should be clear.' McBoyle v. United States, 283 U.S. 25, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340, 341, 75 L.Ed. 816 (1931) (Holmes, J.).15 See also United States v. Cardiff, 344 U.S. 174, 73 S.Ct. 189, 97 L.Ed. 200 (1952). Second, because of the seriousness of criminal penalties, and because criminal punishment usually represents the moral condemnation of the community, legislatures and not courts should define criminal activity. This policy embodies 'the instinctive distastes against men languishing in prison unless the lawmaker has clearly said they should.' H. Friendly Mr. Justice Frankfurter and the Reading of Statutes, in Benchmarks 196, 209 (1967). Thus, where there is ambiguity in a criminal statute, doubts are resolved in favor of the defendant. Here, we conclude that Congress has not 'plainly and unmistakably,' United States v. Gradwell, 243 U.S. 476, 485, 37 S.Ct. 407, 411, 61 L.Ed. 857 (1917), made it a federal crime for a convicted felon simply to possess a gun absent some demonstrated nexus with interstate commerce.\\n\\n\\n15\\nThere is a second principle supporting today's result: unless Congress conveys its purpose clearly, it will not be deemed to have significantly changed the federal-state balance.16 Congress has traditionally been reluctant to define as a federal crime conduct readily denounced as criminal by the States.17 This congressional policy is rooted in the same concepts of American federalism that have provided the basis for judge-made doctrines. See, e.g., Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). As this Court emphasized only last Term in Rewis v. United States, supra, we will not be quick to assume that Congress has meant to effect a significant change in the sensitive relation between federal and state criminal jurisdiction. In traditionally sensitive areas, such as legislation affecting the federal balance, the requirement of clear statement assures that the legislature has in fact faced, and intended to bring into issue, the critical matters involved in the judicial decision. In Rewis, we declined to accept an expansive interpretation of the Travel Act. To do so, we said then, 'would alter sensitive federalstate relationships (and) could overextend limited federal police resources.' While we noted there that '(i)t is not for us to weigh the merits of these factors,' we went on to conclude that 'the fact that they are not even discussed in the legislative history . . . strongly suggests that Congress did not intend that (the statute have the broad reach).' 401 U.S., at 812, 91 S.Ct., at 1059. In the instant case, the broad construction urged by the Government renders traditionally local criminal conduct a matter for federal enforcement and would also involve a substantial extension of federal police resources. Absent proof of some interstate commerce nexus in each case, § 1202(a) dramatically intrudes upon traditional state criminal jurisdiction. As in Rewis, the legislative history provides scanty basis for concluding that Congress faced these serious questions and meant to affect the federal-state balance in the way now claimed by the Government. Absent a clearer statement of intention from Congress than is present here, we do not interpret § 1202(a) to reach the 'mere possession' of firearms.\\n\\nIII\\n\\n16\\nHaving concluded that the commerce requirement in § 1202(a) must be read as part of the 'possesses' and 'receives' offenses, we add a final word about the nexus with interstate commerce that must be shown in individual cases. The Government can obviously meet its burden in a variety of ways. We note only some of these. For example, a person 'possesses . . . in commerce or affecting commerce' if at the time of the offense the gun was moving interstate or on an interstate facility, or if the possession affects commerce. Significantly broader in reach, however, is the offense of 'receiv(ing) . . . in commerce or affecting commerce,' for we conclude that the Government meets its burden here if it demonstrates that the firearm received has previously traveled in interstate commerce.18 This is not the narrowest possible reading of the statute, but canons of clear statement and strict construction do 'not mean that every criminal statute must be given the narrowest possible meaning in complete disregard of the purpose of the legislature.' United States v. Bramblett, 348 U.S. 503, 510, 75 S.Ct. 504, 508, 99 L.Ed. 594 (1955). We have resolved the basic uncertainty about the statute in favor of the narrow reading, concluding that 'in commerce or affecting commerce' is part of the offense of possessing or receiving a firearm. But, given the evils that prompted the statute and the basic legislative purpose of restricting the firearm-related activity of convicted felons, the readings we give to the commerce requirement, although not all narrow, are appropriate. And consistent with our regard for the sensitive relation between federal and state criminal jurisdiction, our reading preserves as an element of all the offenses a requirement suited to federal criminal jurisdiction alone.\\n\\n\\n17\\nThe judgment is affirmed.\\n\\n\\n18\\nAffirmed.\\n\\n\\n19\\nMr. Justice BRENNAN joins the judgment of the Court and the opinion except for Part III. No question of the quantum of evidence necessary to establish the Government's prima facie case is before the Court and he would await a case properly presenting that question before deciding it.\\n\\n\\n20\\nMr. Justice BLACKMUN, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joins, dissenting.\\n\\n\\n21\\nI cannot join the Court's opinion and judgment. Five of the six United States courts of appeals that have passed upon the issue presented by this case have decided it adversely to the position urged by the respondent here. United States v. Cabbler, 429 F.2d 577 (CA4 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 901, 91 S.Ct. 138, 27 L.Ed.2d 138; United States, v. Mullins, 432 F.2d 1003 (CA4 1970); United States v. Donofrio, 450 F.2d 1054 (CA5 1971); Stevens v. United States, 440 F.2d 144 (CA6 1971) (one judge dissenting); United States v. Synnes, 438 F.2d 764 (CA8 1971); United States v. Wiley, 438 F.2d 773 (CA8 1971); United States v. Taylor, 438 F.2d 774 (CA8 1971); United States v. Daniels, 431 F.2d 697 (CA9 1970); United States v. Crow, 439 F.2d 1193 (CA9 1971). Only the Second Circuit stands opposed.1\\n\\n\\n22\\n1. The statute, 18 U.S.C.App. § 1202 (a), when it speaks of one 'who receives, possesses, or transports in commerce or affecting commerce,' although arguably ambiguous and, as the Government concedes, 'not a model of logic or clarity,'2 is clear enough. The structure of the vital language and its punctuation make it refer to one who receives, to one who possesses, and to one who transports in commerce. If one wished to say that he would welcome a cat, would welcome a dog, or would welcome a cow that jumps over the moon, he would likely say 'I would like to have a cat, a dog, or a cow that jumps over the moon.' So it is here.\\n\\n\\n23\\n2. The meaning the Court implants on the statute is justified only by the addition and interposition of a comma after the word 'transports.' I perceive no warrant for this judicial transfiguration.\\n\\n\\n24\\n3. In the very same statute the phrase 'after the date of enactment of this Act' is separated by commas and undeniably modifies each of the preceding words, 'receives,' 'possesses,' and 'transports.' Obviously, then, the draftsman—and the Congress—knew the use of commas for phrase modification. We should give effect to the only meaning attendant upon that use.\\n\\n\\n25\\n4. The specific finding in 18 U.S.C.App. § 12013 clearly demonstrates that Congress was attempting to reach and prohibit every possession of a firearm by a felon; that Congress found that such possession, whether interstate or intrastate, affected interstate commerce; and that Congress did not conclude that intrastate possession was a matter of less concern to it than interstate possession. That finding was unnecessary if Congress also required proof that each receipt or possession of a firearm was in or affected interstate or foreign commerce.\\n\\n\\n26\\n5. Senator Long's explanatory comments reveal clearly the purpose, the intent, and the extent of the legislation:\\n\\n\\n27\\n'I have prepared an amendment which I will offer at an      appropriate time, simply setting forth the fact that anybody      who has been convicted of a felony . . . is not permitted to      possess a firearm . . ..\\n\\n\\n28\\n'It might be well to analyze, for a moment, the logic      involved. When a man has been convicted of a felony, unless      as this bill sets forth—he has been expressly pardoned by the      President and the pardon states that the person is to be      permitted to possess firearms in the future, that man would      have no right to possess firearms. He would be punished criminally if he is      found in possession of them.' 114 Cong.Rec. 13868 (emphasis      supplied).\\n\\n\\n29\\n'So Congress simply finds that the possession of these      weapons by the wrong kind of people is either a burden on      commerce or a threat that affects the free flow of commerce.\\n\\n\\n30\\n'You cannot do business in an area, and you certainly cannot      do as much of it and do it as well as you would like, if in      order to do business you have to go through a street where      there are burglars, murderers, and arsonists armed to the      teeth against innocent citizens. So the threat certainly      affects the free flow of commerce.' 114 Cong.Rec. 13869      (emphasis supplied).\\n\\n\\n31\\n'What the amendment seeks to do is to make it unlawful for a      firearm—be it a handgun, a machinegun, a longrange rifle, or      any kind of firearm—to be in the possession of a convicted      felon who has not been pardoned and who has therefore lost      his right to possess firearms. . . . It also relates to the      transportation of firearms.\\n\\n\\n32\\n'Clauses 1—5 describe persons who, by their actions, have      demonstrated that they are dangerous, or that they may become      dangerous. Stated simply, they may not be trusted to possess      a firearm without becoming a threat to society. This title      would apply both to hand guns and to long guns.\\n\\n\\n33\\n'All of these murderers had shown violent tendencies before      they committed the crime for which they are most infamous.      They should not have been permitted to possess a gun. Yet,      there is no Federal law which would deny possession to these      undesirables.\\n\\n\\n34\\n'The killer of Medgar Evers, the murderer of the three           civil rights workers in Mississippi, the defendants who           shot Captain Lemuel Penn (on a highway while he was           driving back to Washington after completion of reserve           Military duty) would all be free under present Federal           law to acquire another gun and repeat those same sorts           of crimes in the future.\\n\\n\\n35\\n'So under Title VII, every citizen could possess a gun until      the commission of his first felony. Upon his conviction,      however, Title VII would deny every assassin, murderer, thief      and burglar of the right to possess a firearm in the future      except where he has been pardoned by the President or a State      Governor and has been expressly authorized by his pardon to      possess a firearm.\\n\\n\\n36\\n'It has been said that Congress lacks the power to outlaw      mere possession of weapons. . . .\\n\\n\\n37\\n'. . . The important point is that this legislation      demonstrates that possession of a deadly weapon by the wrong      people can be controlled by Congress, without regard to where      the police power resides under the Constitution.\\n\\n\\n38\\n'Without question, the Federal Government does have power to      control possession of weapons where such possession could      become a threat to interstate commerce . . ..\\n\\n\\n39\\n'State gun control laws where they exist have proven      inadequate to bar possession of firearms from those most      likely to use them for unlawful purposes . . ..\\n\\n\\n40\\n'Nor would Title VII impinge upon the rights of citizens      generally to possess firearms for legitimate and lawful      purposes. It deals solely with those who have demonstrated that they cannot be trusted to possess      a firearm—those whose prior acts—mostly voluntary—have placed      them outside of our society. . . .\\n\\n\\n41\\n'. . . I am convinced that we have enough constitutional      power to prohibit these categories of people from possessing,      receiving, or transporting a firearm. . . .\\n\\n\\n42\\n'This amendment would provide that a convicted felon who      participates in one of these marches and is carrying a      firearm would be violating the law. . . .' 114 Cong.Rec.      14773—14774 (emphasis supplied).\\n\\n\\n43\\nOne cannot detect in these remarks any purpose to restrict or limit the type of possession that was being considered for proscription.\\n\\n\\n44\\n6. The Court's construction of § 1202(a), limiting its application to interstate possession and receipt, shrinks the statute into something little more than a duplication of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g) and (h). I cannot ascribe to Congress such a gesture of nonaccomplishment.\\n\\n\\n45\\nI thus conclude that § 1202(a) was intended to and does reach all possessions and receipts of firearms by convicted felons, and that the Court should move on and decide the constitutional issue present in this case.\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n Section 1202(a) reads in full:\\n'Any person who—\\n'(1) has been convicted by a court of the United States or of a State or any political subdivision thereof of a felony, or\\n'(2) has been discharged from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions, or\\n'(3) has been adjudged by a court of the United States or of a State or any political subdivision thereof of being mentally incompetent, or\\n'(4) having been a citizen of the United States has renounced his citizenship, or\\n'(5) being an alien is illegally or unlawfully in the United States, and who receives, possesses, or transports in commerce or affecting commerce, after the date of enactment of this Act, any firearm shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than two years, or both.'\\n\\n\\n2\\n Respondent was acquitted on another count charging him with carrying a firearm during the commission of a felony (the sale of a narcotic drug), a federal offense under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(2).\\n\\n\\n3\\n At this date, six circuits and numerous district courts have decided the issue. The Government's view was adopted in United States v. Cabbler, 429 F.2d 577 (CA 4 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 901, 91 S.Ct. 138, 27 L.Ed.2d 138; United States v. Donofrio, 450 F.2d 1054 (CA 5 1971); Stevens v. United States, 440 F.2d 144 (CA 6 1971) (one judge dissenting); United States v. Synnes, 438 F.2d 764 (CA 8 1971); United States v. Daniels, 431 F.2d 697 (CA9 1970). The result reached by the Second Circuit in this case has also been reached in United States v. Harbin, 313 F.Supp. 50 (N.D.Ind.1970); United States v. Steed, No. CR 70—57 (WD Tenn., May 11, 1970); United States v. Phelps, No. CR—14,465 (MD Tenn., Feb. 10, 1970); United CR—14465 (MD Tenn.1970); United States v. Francis, No. CR 12,684 (ED Tenn., Dec. 12, 1969).\\n\\n\\n4\\n In light of our disposition of the case, we do not reach the question whether, upon appropriate findings, Congress can constitutionally punish the 'mere possession' of firearms; thus, we need not consider the relevance, in that connection, of our recent decision in Perez v. United States, 402 U.S. 146, 91 S.Ct. 1357, 28 L.Ed.2d 686 (1971). The question whether the definition of 'felony' in § 1202(c)(2) creates a classification violating the Fifth Amendment was not raised in the Government's Petition for Certiorari, and is also not considered here.\\n\\n\\n5\\n Frankfurter, Some Reflections on the Reading of Statutes, 47 Col.L.Rev. 527, 543 (1947).\\n\\n\\n6\\n Compare United States v. Standard Brewery, Inc., 251 U.S. 210, 218, 40 S.Ct. 139, 140, 64 L.Ed. 229 (1920), with FTC v. Mandel Brothers, Inc., 359 U.S. 385, 389—390, 79 S.Ct. 818, 822, 823, 3 L.Ed.2d 893 (1959); see also 2 J. Sutherland Statutory Construction § 4921 (3d ed. 1943); K. Llewellyn, The Common Law Tradition 527 (1960).\\nThe Government, noting that there is no comma after 'transports,' argues that the punctuation indicates a congressional intent to limit the qualifying phrase to the last antecedent. But many leading grammarians, while sometimes noting that commas at the end of series can avoid ambiguity, concede that use of such commas is discretionary. See, e.g., B. Evans & C. Evans, A Dictionary of Contemporary American Usage 103 (1957); M. Nicholson, A Dictionary of American-English Usage 94 (1957); R. Copperud, A Dictionary of Usage and Style 94—95 (1964); cf. W. Strunk & E. White, The Elements of Style 1—2 (1959). When grammarians are divided, and surely where they are cheerfully tolerant, we will not attach significance to an omitted comma. It is enough to say that the statute's punctuation is fully consistent with the respondent's interpretation, and that in this case grammatical expertise will not help to clarify the statute's meaning.\\n\\n\\n7\\n The Government urges that 'transports' includes the act of 'causing a firearm to be transported,' and therefore would connote an offense separate in some cases from 'receives' or 'possesses.' From this, the Government argues that 'Congress might have felt that the broader scope of the term 'transports,' as compared to the terms 'receives' or 'possesses,' justified its qualification by the interstate commerce requirement.' Brief for the United States 14—15. The Government's view about the comparative breadth of the various offenses certainly does not follow from its definition of 'transports.' But beyond that, its argument about what Congress 'might have felt' is purely speculative, and finds no support in any arguable purpose of the statute. There is certainly no basis for concluding that Congress was less concerned about the transporting and supplying of guns than their acquisition.\\n\\n\\n8\\n 434 F.2d, at 1298. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 2421 (prostitution); 18 U.S.C. § 1952 (Travel Act); 18 U.S.C. § 1951 (robbery and extortion); 18 U.S.C. § 1231 (strikebreaking); 18 U.S.C. § 1201 (kidnaping); 18 U.S.C. § 1084 (gambling); 18 U.S.C. § 842(i) (explosives); 15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (antitrust); 15 U.S.C. § 77e (securities fraud).\\n\\n\\n9\\n Title VII limits the firearm-related activity of convicted felons, dishonorable discharges from the Armed Services, persons adjudged 'mentally incompetent,' aliens illegally in the country, and former citizens who have renounced their citizenship. See n. 1, supra. A felony is defined as 'any offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, but does not include any offense (other than one involving a firearm or explosive) classified as a misdemeanor under the laws of a State and punishable by a term of imprisonment of two years or less . . ..' 18 U.S.C.App. § 1202(c)(2).\\nTitle IV reaches persons 'under indictment for, or . . . convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year'; fugitives from justice; users or addicts of various drugs; persons adjudicated as 'mental defective(s) or . . . committed' to a mental institution. 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) and (h).\\n\\n\\n10\\n Title IV, 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) and (h), is a modified and recodified version of 15 U.S.C. § 902(e) and (f) (1964 ed.), 75 Stat. 757, which in turn amended the original statute passed in 1938, 52 Stat. 1250, 1251. Each amendment enlarged the group of people coming within the Act's substantive prohibitions against transportation or receipt of firearms in interstate commerce. The wording of the substantive offense has remained identical, although the original Act had a provision that possession of a firearm 'shall be presumptive evidence that such firearm or ammunition was shipped or transported or received (in interstate or foreign commerce).' That presumption was struck down in Tot v. United States, 319 U.S. 463, 63 S.Ct. 1241, 87 L.Ed. 1519 (1943), and the Court there noted:\\n'(T)he Act is confined to the receipt of firearms or ammunition as a part of interstate transportation and does not extend to the receipt, in an intrastate transaction, of such articles which, at some prior time, have been transported interstate.' Id., at 466, 63 S.Ct., at 1244. While the reach of Title IV itself is a question to be decided finally some other day, the Government has presented here no learning or other evidence indicating that the 1968 Act changed the prior approach to the 'receipt' offense. See, e.g., S.Rep.No.1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 115 (1968); U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News, p. 2112.\\n\\n\\n11\\n The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 started its life as a measure designed to aid state and local governments in law enforcement by means of financial and administrative assistance. See H.R.Rep.No.488, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967). The bill passed the House on August 8, 1967, and went to the Senate. A similar bill was introduced in the Senate (S. 917) and went to the Committee on the Judiciary, which rewrote it completely. See S.Rep.No.1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., supra. The amendments included the much-debated provisions regarding the admissibility of confessions, wiretapping, and state firearms control.\\nOn May 17, 1968, Senator Long introduced on the floor his amendment to S. 917, which he designated Title VII. His introductory remarks set forth the purpose of the amendment. 114 Cong.Rec. 13867—13869. About a week later he explained his amendment once again. There was a brief debate; the reaction was favorable but cautious, with 'further thought' and 'study' being suggested by several favorably inclined Senators who observed some problems with the bill as drafted. Unexpectedly, however, there was a call for a vote and Title VII passed without modification. See 114 Cong.Rec. 14772—14775. The amendment received only passing mention in the House discussion of the bill, 114 Cong.Rec. 16286, 16298, and never received committee consideration or study in the House either.\\n\\n\\n12\\n See 114 Cong.Rec. 13868—13871, 14772—14775.\\n\\n\\n13\\n For example, Senator Long began his floor statement by announcing:\\n'I have prepared an amendment which I will offer at an appropriate time, simply setting forth the fact that anybody who has been convicted of a felony (or comes within certain other categories) . . . is not permitted to possess a firearm . . ..' 114 Cong.Rec. 13868.\\n\\n\\n14\\n For the same, and additional, reasons, § 1201, which contains the congressional 'findings' applicable to § 1202(a), is not decisive support for the Government. That section reports that:\\n'The Congress hereby finds and declares that the receipt, possession, or transportation of a firearm by felons, veterans who are discharged under dishonorable conditions, mental incompetents, aliens who are illegally in the country, and former citizens who have renounced their citizenship, constitutes—\\n'(1) a burden on commerce or threat affecting the free flow of commerce,\\n'(2) a threat to the safety of the President of the United States and Vice President of the United States,\\n'(3) an impediment or a threat to the exercise of free speech and the free exercise of a religion guaranteed by the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and\\n'(4) a threat to the continued and effective operation of the Government of the United States and of the government of each State guaranteed by article IV of the Constitution.'\\nThe Government argues that these findings would have been 'wholly unnecessary' unless Congress intended to prohibit all receipts and possessions of firearms by felons. But these findings of 'burdens' and 'threats' simply state Congress' view of the constitutional basis for its power to act; the findings do not tell us how much of Congress' perceived power was in fact invoked. That the findings in fact support a statute broader than the one actually passed is suggested by the fact that 'in commerce or affecting commerce' does not appear at all in the introductory clause to the 'findings,' even though § 1202(a) contains the phrase and concededly reaches only transportation 'in commerce or affecting commerce.'\\n\\n\\n15\\n Holmes prefaced his much-quoted statement with the observation that 'it is not likely that a criminal will carefully consider the text of the law before he murders or steals . . ..' But in the case of gun acquisition and possession it is not unreasonable to imagine a citizen attempting to '(steer) a careful course between violation of the statute (and lawful conduct),' United States v. Hood, 343 U.S. 148, 151, 72 S.Ct. 568, 570, 96 L.Ed. 846 (1952). Of course, where there is a state law prohibiting felons from possessing firearms, as in New York State, N.Y. Penal Law § 265.05 (McKinney's Consol.Laws, c. 40, Supp.1971 1972), it may be unreal to argue that there are notice problems under the federal law. There are many States, however, that do not have their own laws prohibiting felons from possessing firearms. See Geisel, Roll, & Wettick, The Effectiveness of State and Local Regulation of Handguns: A Statistical Analysis, 1969 Duke L.J. 647, 652—653. Since ex-offenders in these States are limited only by the federal gun control laws, the notice problem of that law may be quite real.\\n\\n\\n16\\n Apex Hosiery Co. v.

May-\\nParker, Assistant United States Attorney, OFFICE OF THE\\nUNITED STATES ATTORNEY, Raleigh, North Carolina,\\nfor Appellee.\\n\\n\\n                             OPINION\\n\\nSHEDD, Circuit Judge:\\n\\n   The Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\") imposes a 15-\\nyear mandatory prison term on an individual convicted of\\nbeing a felon in possession of a firearm if that individual has\\n\"three previous convictions . . . for a violent felony or a seri-\\nous drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different\\nfrom one another.\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). Daryl Steven Carr\\npled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm and was\\nsentenced as an armed career criminal to 262 months of\\nimprisonment. The district court applied the ACCA enhance-\\nment because Carr has four prior state convictions encom-\\npassing 13 counts of felony breaking or entering under N.C.\\nGen. Stat. § 14-54(a). In this appeal, Carr acknowledges that\\nhe has more than three previous convictions for a violent felony,1\\nbut he argues that the violent felonies were not \"committed on\\noccasions different from one another\" and, therefore, the\\nACCA does not apply. For the following reasons, we reject\\nhis contention and affirm.\\n\\n                                   I\\n\\n   In September 1996, a Washington County, North Carolina,\\ngrand jury issued 13 separate indictments charging Carr with\\nfelony breaking or entering in violation of § 14-54(a). Each\\nindictment (1) alleges that on May 21, 2006, Carr broke into\\n    1\\n   We recently reaffirmed circuit precedent that breaking or entering\\nunder § 14-54(a) is an ACCA violent felony. See United States v. Thomp-\\nson, 588 F.3d 197 (4th Cir. 2009).\\n\\x0c                         UNITED STATES v. CARR                              3\\na building used as a storage unit located at \"N.C. 32 South\"\\nwith the intent to commit felony larceny; (2) identifies a dif-\\nferent storage unit (units #C-15, #C-16, #D-5, #D-6, #D-7,\\n#D-8, #D-10, #D-11, #D-12, #D-22, #F-8, #F-9, and #F-13);\\nand (3) lists the occupant of each storage unit (totaling 10 dif-\\nferent occupants). J.A. 23-35. Nine of the indictments list\\nitems that were stolen from the particular storage units. Carr\\npled guilty to all of the indictments in November 1996.2\\n\\n   In 2007, Carr was indicted on two counts of possessing a\\nstolen firearm and one count of being a felon in possession of\\na firearm. According to the presentence investigative report\\n(\"PSR\"), Carr’s federal offense conduct involves his theft of\\nfirearms and ammunition from several law enforcement patrol\\ncars and his subsequent act of shooting a firearm at law\\nenforcement officers (and wounding one officer) as they\\nattempted to stop him. He pled guilty to the felon-in-\\npossession count.\\n\\n  In his PSR, a probation officer designated Carr as an armed\\ncareer criminal based on the aforementioned breaking or\\nentering convictions.3 With this designation, Carr’s sentencing\\nguideline range was calculated to be 210 to 262 months. Carr\\n  2\\n     We note that the indictments actually charge Carr with breaking and\\nentering, but (as we explain later) the judgments correctly specify that the\\ncrime for which he was convicted is breaking or entering. We further note\\nthat the nine indictments listing stolen items also charge Carr with feloni-\\nous larceny and felonious possession of stolen goods. Although he pled\\nguilty to some of those charges, the parties do not argue that those crimes\\nare relevant to our analysis. Finally, we note that 12 of the indictments list\\n\"N.C. 32, South\" as being in Plymouth, North Carolina, while one indict-\\nment lists that address as being in Washington, North Carolina.\\n   3\\n     In addition to the four 1996 convictions addressed herein, Carr also has\\nstate convictions for assault by pointing a gun (1995); simple assault\\n(1995); second degree trespass (1996); shoplifting (2001); injury to real\\nproperty (two separate convictions in 2002); carrying a concealed weapon,\\nsecond degree trespass, and resisting a police officer (2005); larceny\\n(2005); possession of marijuana and second degree trespass (2005); and\\npossession of marijuana (2006). J.A. 120-23.\\n\\x0c4                       UNITED STATES v. CARR\\nobjected to application of the ACCA, arguing that the break-\\ning or entering crimes were not committed on different occa-\\nsions. The district court overruled the objection and sentenced\\nhim to 262 months. This appeal followed.\\n\\n                                    II\\n\\n   Resolution of this appeal involves a determination of\\nwhether the record establishes that Carr committed the 13 fel-\\nony breaking or entering crimes \"on occasions different from\\none another.\" If it does, then the district court correctly\\napplied the ACCA in sentencing Carr.4 On this point, the dis-\\ntrict court surveyed our precedent, as well as several cases\\nfrom other circuits, and concluded:\\n\\n        The question of whether breaking and entering mul-\\n        tiple subunits at a single complex constitutes sepa-\\n        rate occasions for purposes of the ACCA does not\\n        appear to have been squarely addressed by the\\n        Fourth Circuit. Based on persuasive authority, and\\n        the circumstances presented, the court finds that the\\n        physical and temporal proximity of the offenses at\\n        issue do not indicate that they occurred on a single\\n        occasion for ACCA purposes. To hold breaking and\\n        entering into separate storage units is a single crimi-\\n        nal \"occasion\" would be to ignore the available\\n        record and the reality of the situation.\\n    4\\n    Generally, we review a sentence in two parts: first, we review for sig-\\nnificant procedural error, such as improperly calculating the advisory sen-\\ntencing guidelines range; second, absent significant procedural error, we\\nreview for substantive reasonableness. See Gall v. United States, 552 U.S.\\n38, 51 (2007). Although our determination of whether the ACCA enhance-\\nment applies involves review for significant procedural error, United\\nStates v. Walker, 555 F.3d 716, 722 (8th Cir. 2009), it involves only a\\n\"question of statutory interpretation\" that we consider de novo, United\\nStates v. Letterlough, 63 F.3d 332, 334 (4th Cir. 1995). Carr does not oth-\\nerwise challenge his sentence.\\n\\x0c                    UNITED STATES v. CARR                     5\\nUnited States v. Carr, 2008 Westlaw 4641346, *3 (E.D.N.C.\\nOct. 16, 2008). For the reasons that follow, we agree with the\\ncourt’s conclusion.\\n\\n                              A.\\n\\n   As the district court noted, we have not decided the appli-\\ncability of the ACCA in a case involving facts similar to this\\none. However, in several published opinions we have consid-\\nered whether potential ACCA predicate offenses that were\\nclose in time or proximity were committed on different occa-\\nsions for sentencing purposes.\\n\\n   For example, in Letterlough, the defendant challenged the\\napplicability of the ACCA to his sentence, arguing that two\\nof his three predicate offenses were not committed on differ-\\nent occasions. Those offenses were two separate sales of a\\nsingle dose of crack cocaine to the same undercover officer on\\nthe same day; the first sale occurred at 8:35 p.m., and the sec-\\nond sale occurred at 10:15 p.m. Examining the operative lan-\\nguage of the ACCA, we stated that \"Congress intended to\\ninclude within the scope of the ACCA only those predicate\\noffenses that can be isolated with a beginning and an end —\\nones that constitute an occurrence unto themselves.\" 63 F.3d\\nat 335. With this in mind, we adopted the following definition\\nto determine whether the ACCA applies to a defendant’s\\nclosely related prior crimes: \"Convictions occur on occasions\\ndifferent from one another ‘if each of the prior convictions\\narose out of a separate and distinct criminal episode.’\" Id.\\n(quoting United States v. Hudspeth, 42 F.3d 1015, 1019 (7th\\nCir. 1994) (en banc) (emphasis in original) (internal punctua-\\ntion marks omitted)).\\n\\n   Continuing, we noted that \"although this definition may be\\nclear, the factual permutations surrounding the ACCA tend to\\ncreate havoc. As a result, courts have applied a multiplicity of\\nfactors to determine when more than one conviction consti-\\ntutes a separate and distinct criminal episode.\" Id. We listed\\n\\x0c6                   UNITED STATES v. CARR\\nthese factors as including whether the offenses arose in differ-\\nent geographic locations, whether the nature of the offenses\\nwas substantively different, and whether the offenses involved\\nmultiple victims or multiple criminal objectives, and we\\nexplained the fluid nature of the analysis:\\n\\n    Courts have applied these factors independently, or\\n    in conjunction, to decide that a defendant’s similar\\n    offenses are actually separate and distinct from one\\n    another. In essence, if any one of the factors has a\\n    strong presence, it can dispositively segregate an\\n    extended criminal enterprise into a series of separate\\n    and distinct episodes.\\n\\nId. at 336 (footnote omitted).\\n\\n   Applying these principles to the facts of the case, we\\naffirmed the application of the ACCA. In doing so, we\\nrejected the defendant’s contention that the two drug sales\\nwere part of a continuous drug transaction. We held instead\\nthat each drug transaction \"was a complete and final transac-\\ntion, and therefore, an independent offense.\" Id. at 337.\\n\\n   We next considered this issue in United States v. Hobbs,\\n136 F.3d 384 (4th Cir. 1998), in which the district court\\ndeclined to apply the ACCA enhancement because it found\\nthat three of the defendant’s four predicate burglary offenses\\n(each involving a small, unoccupied country grocery store)\\noccurred within the space of one hour and, consequently, did\\nnot occur \"on occasions different from one another.\" Analyz-\\ning the case under Letterlough, we disagreed and remanded\\nfor resentencing under the ACCA.\\n\\n   We first found that the three burglaries occurred at least a\\nmile apart from one another, and this fact suggested that they\\nwere separate and distinct criminal episodes. However, we\\nthen found that the nature of the burglaries was not substan-\\ntively different because \"each involved a break-in of a small,\\n\\x0c                    UNITED STATES v. CARR                     7\\nunoccupied country store from which [the defendant] stole\\nfood, cash, and/or dry goods.\" Id. at 389. We noted that this\\nfact \"while not enough on its own to suggest that the offenses\\noccurred on the same occasion, would bolster such a conclu-\\nsion, if that conclusion were also supported by other facts.\"\\nId. We then examined whether there were multiple victims\\nand criminal objectives, and we found that although the objec-\\ntives of the burglaries appeared similar, there were multiple\\nvictims because each store was under separate ownership. We\\nconcluded that \"the fact that there were multiple victims deci-\\nsively tips the scales in favor of concluding that each burglary\\nwas a ‘separate and distinct criminal episode.’\" Id. (quoting\\nLetterlough, 63 F.3d at 335).\\n\\n   We again considered the issue in United States v. Williams,\\n187 F.3d 429 (4th Cir. 1999). The defendant in that case had\\nfour prior felony offenses, three of which stemmed from his\\nflight from law enforcement officers at a traffic checkpoint.\\nDuring the flight, which lasted 10-15 minutes and spanned\\nover three blocks, the defendant shot at one officer (leading\\nto a conviction for assault with a firearm on a government\\nofficer) and later pointed his firearm at two other officers\\n(leading to two convictions for assault with a deadly weapon\\nwith intent to kill).\\n\\n   On his appeal from his ACCA-enhanced sentence, the\\ndefendant argued that the three assault offenses should be\\nconsidered as having occurred on the same occasion for pur-\\nposes of the ACCA. We disagreed, concluding under Letter-\\nlough and Hobbs that there were \"two complete and discrete\\ncriminal transactions\": the initial shooting at one officer and\\nthe subsequent pointing of a firearm at the other two officers.\\nId. at 431. We noted that the fact \"that the events occurred\\nwithin a short period of time does not dictate a result that the\\noffenses occurred on one occasion.\" Id. We instead based our\\ndecision on the fact that the defendant had an interval of time\\nbetween the two incidents that \"provided him with the oppor-\\n\\x0c8                    UNITED STATES v. CARR\\ntunity to reflect and desist,\" and that there were different vic-\\ntims. Id.\\n\\n   In United States v. James, 337 F.3d 387 (4th Cir. 2003), we\\naffirmed an ACCA-enhanced sentence, rejecting the defen-\\ndant’s argument that his two prior convictions for burglary\\nwere improperly counted for ACCA purposes because the\\nburglaries occurred on the same day at two different stores\\nthat were across the street from one another. We concluded:\\n\\n    Even though James committed the two burglaries on\\n    the same day, his two convictions clearly arose out\\n    of separate and distinct criminal episodes. The first\\n    burglary was completed before the second started,\\n    each burglary occurred at a different location, and\\n    each involved a different victim. Thus, the district\\n    court properly applied the armed career criminal\\n    enhancement to James’s sentence.\\n\\nId. at 391 (citation omitted).\\n\\n   Finally, in United States v. Leeson, 453 F.3d 631 (4th Cir.\\n2006), the defendant contended that the district court erred by\\ncounting his prior convictions for aggravated robbery and\\nattempted capital murder separately for ACCA purposes\\nbecause they were committed on the same occasion. The facts\\nof that case established that while the defendant was commit-\\nting an aggravated robbery of an individual in a grocery store\\n(the first conviction), an off-duty police officer who was out-\\nside the store observed what was happening and, upon the\\ndefendant’s exit, ordered him to stop. The defendant then\\nfired his weapon at the officer (the second conviction).\\n\\n   Applying the Letterlough factors, we concluded that one\\nfactor – geography – suggested that the crimes were commit-\\nted in one criminal episode because they occurred on the\\nstore’s premises. However, we concluded that the other fac-\\ntors all pointed toward two separate and distinct criminal epi-\\n\\x0c                     UNITED STATES v. CARR                     9\\nsodes. Specifically, we found that the crimes were distinctly\\ndifferent in nature, had different victims, and had different\\ncriminal objectives. Additionally, we found that the defendant\\n\"had the opportunity to make a conscious and knowing deci-\\nsion to cease and desist his criminal behavior or engage in yet\\nanother crime.\" Id. at 641. We concluded by rejecting the\\nnotion that because the defendant’s conduct fit the description\\nof a crime spree, the crimes were part of a single criminal epi-\\nsode:\\n\\n    [O]ur holding today that these two offenses consti-\\n    tute crimes committed on occasions different from\\n    one another for purposes of increasing Leeson’s sen-\\n    tence under the ACCA is consistent with our case\\n    law which recognizes that, criminals who commit\\n    separate crimes against different individuals while\\n    on a spree, within a short period of time, provided\\n    that the perpetrator had the opportunity to cease and\\n    desist from his criminal actions at any time[,] com-\\n    mit crimes on occasions different from one another.\\n\\nId. at 642-43 (citations and internal punctuation omitted).\\n\\n                               B.\\n\\n   Although we have not decided a factually similar case,\\nother circuits have. Because we cited or discussed it favorably\\nin Letterlough, Hobbs, Williams, and Leeson, the most notable\\nof these cases is United States v. Hudspeth, 42 F.3d 1015 (7th\\nCir. 1994) (en banc). In Hudspeth, the district court sentenced\\nthe defendant as an armed career criminal, relying on his three\\nprior burglary convictions. Those burglaries occurred in a\\nstrip mall during a 35-minute period, when the defendant and\\nhis accomplices broke into a doughnut shop, a dry cleaning\\nstore, and an insurance company. From the record of that\\ncase, it appears that the burglars first broke into a door to the\\ndry cleaning store, then used a sledgehammer to break\\nthrough the shared wall between the dry cleaner and the\\n\\x0c10                   UNITED STATES v. CARR\\ndoughnut shop, and subsequently forced open a door between\\nthe doughnut shop and the insurance company. On appeal, the\\ndefendant unsuccessfully argued that these burglaries were\\nnot committed on different occasions for ACCA purposes.\\n\\n   The Seventh Circuit began its analysis by noting that \"a\\ndefendant is subject to the [ACCA] sentence enhancement if\\neach of the prior convictions arose out of a ‘separate and dis-\\ntinct criminal episode,’\" and it listed \"the nature of the crimes,\\nthe identities of the victims, and the locations\" as being perti-\\nnent to the analysis of whether multiple convictions arose out\\nof separate and distinct criminal episodes. Id. at 1019 (citation\\nomitted, emphasis in original). Surveying several circuit\\ncases, the court then explained:\\n\\n     Cases interpreting the ACCA clearly uphold the\\n     minimum fifteen-year sentence enhancement for\\n     criminals who commit separate crimes against differ-\\n     ent individuals while on a spree, within a short\\n     period of time, provided that the perpetrator had the\\n     opportunity to cease and desist from his criminal\\n     actions at any time. . . .\\n\\n     Under the ACCA, the relevant inquiry as to the tim-\\n     ing of multiple crimes is simple: were the crimes\\n     simultaneous or were they sequential?\\n\\nId. at 1020-21 (emphasis in original).\\n\\n    Turning to the specific facts before it, the Seventh Circuit\\nconcluded that the sentence was proper because the defendant\\nhad committed \"three distinct burglaries against three separate\\nvictims (the owners of three distinct business enterprises), in\\nthree separate locations over the course of more than thirty\\nminutes. . . .\" Id. at 1021 (footnotes omitted). Continuing, the\\ncourt explained that the defendant’s three burglaries \"were\\nsequential (committed in succession), and not simultaneous;\\nit is physically impossible for one person to commit three bur-\\n\\x0c                    UNITED STATES v. CARR                     11\\nglaries simultaneously at three different locations.\" Id.\\n(emphasis in original).\\n\\n   Without attempting to catalogue all of the analogous cases,\\nwe note that other courts have reached differing results under\\nsimilar facts. For example, in United States v. Tisdale, 921\\nF.2d 1095 (10th Cir. 1990), the Tenth Circuit held (consistent\\nwith Hudspeth) that the ACCA enhancement applied based on\\nthe defendant’s three prior burglaries of separate businesses in\\na shopping mall. The court concluded:\\n\\n    After the defendant \"successfully completed\" bur-\\n    glarizing one business, he was free to leave. The fact\\n    that he chose, instead, to burglarize another business\\n    is evidence of his intent to engage in a separate crim-\\n    inal episode. Moreover, . . . the defendant’s burgla-\\n    ries did not occur at the same location. The record\\n    shows that although defendant entered one shopping\\n    mall he had to physically break and enter three sepa-\\n    rate structures. The fact each incident occurred\\n    inside one enclosed structure does not alter our con-\\n    clusion that the crimes were committed at different\\n    locations.\\n\\nId. at 1099; see also United States v. Phillips, 149 F.3d 1026\\n(9th Cir. 1998) (holding that the defendant’s two prior convic-\\ntions for burglarizing two adjacent businesses on the same\\nnight constituted separate episodes for ACCA purposes).\\n\\n  On the other hand, the Ninth Circuit held that the ACCA\\nenhancement did not apply in United States v. McElyea, 158\\nF.3d 1016 (9th Cir. 1998), which involved prior burglaries of\\ntwo separate stores in a strip mall. As in Hudspeth, the defen-\\ndant and his accomplice broke into the first business and,\\nonce inside, broke through a wall into an adjoining business.\\nThe court concluded:\\n\\n    The record before us does not contain any informa-\\n    tion regarding the amount of time McElyea spent in\\n\\x0c12                      UNITED STATES v. CARR\\n      each store or whether he stayed in one store while\\n      his accomplice entered the other store. Conse-\\n      quently, we cannot say that the burglaries committed\\n      by McElyea were \"separate and distinct criminal epi-\\n      sodes\". Rather, we hold McElyea’s acts were part of\\n      one criminal episode.\\n\\n      McElyea committed two identical crimes in basically\\n      the same location within a short time period. He does\\n      not meet the profile of a career criminal envisioned\\n      by Congress. Consequently, we find that McElyea’s\\n      1980 burglaries were not \"committed on occasions\\n      different from one another\" and the district court\\n      erred in enhancing McElyea’s sentence.\\n\\nId. at 1021.5\\n\\n                                    C.\\n\\n   We now turn to the specific facts before us. In sum, the\\nrecord reveals that on May 21, 1996, at \"N.C. 32 South,\" Carr\\nfeloniously broke or entered into 13 different buildings that\\nwere used by 10 different occupants as storage units. What\\nthe record does not reveal, according to Carr, is whether he\\nbroke or entered into each unit \"one after another, rather than\\nat the same time through [him] going back and forth among\\nthe units to steal items after having broken into all of the\\nunits.\" Brief of Appellant, at 5. As he explains:\\n  5\\n   In United States v. Fuller, 453 F.3d 274 (5th Cir. 2006), the court\\nfound that the defendant’s prior convictions for burglarizing two buildings\\nin a short period of time could not count for ACCA purposes. The court\\nbased its decision on the fact that the record was unclear whether the\\ndefendant entered one building at the same time that his accomplice\\nentered the other building. Under the state burglary law, the defendant\\ncould have been found criminally liable if, in fact, the burglaries were\\ncommitted in that manner. Fuller is inapplicable here because Carr acted\\nalone.\\n\\x0c                       UNITED STATES v. CARR                          13\\n      [F]actually, it is possible for Carr to have committed\\n      the 13 B&Es on May 21, 1996 \"simultaneously\"—he\\n      could have \"broken\" into each storage unit first, by\\n      cutting a lock or breaking a door on each of the 13\\n      units without entering them, and then \"entered\" the\\n      storage units later, going back and forth among the\\n      units and committing larceny from those units in a\\n      haphazard fashion. In this scenario, the breaking and\\n      entering of any one unit is not completed prior to\\n      institution of the next breaking and entering, and\\n      Carr would in fact be breaking and entering all of the\\n      storage units during the same period of time. Thus,\\n      factually, it is not impossible to \"simultaneously\"\\n      break and enter a number of storage units.\\n\\nId. at 15. For that reason, Carr argues that the district court\\nerred in counting his four prior felony convictions for ACCA\\npurposes. We disagree.\\n\\n   As an initial matter, we believe that Carr’s argument rests\\non a faulty premise. Throughout his briefs, Carr refers to the\\n13 crimes as \"breaking and entering\" and, as set forth above,\\nhe contends that it is factually possible for the crimes to have\\noccurred simultaneously. However, as we have noted, Carr\\nwas actually convicted under § 14-54(a) of felonious breaking\\nor entering. This is an important distinction because \"[t]he\\nessential elements of felonious breaking or entering are (1)\\nthe breaking or entering (2) of any building (3) with the intent\\nto commit any felony or larceny therein.\" State v. Williams,\\n411 S.E.2d 814, 818 (N.C. 1992) (emphasis added). Thus,\\n\"the crime described in § 14-54 allows conviction on a show-\\ning of ‘breaking or entering,’ not breaking and entering,\"\\nUnited States v. Bowden, 975 F.2d 1080, 1084 (4th Cir. 1992)\\n(emphasis in original); and it is therefore complete upon\\neither a breaking or an entry, State v. Myrick, 291 S.E.2d 577,\\n579 (N.C. 1982).6 Moreover, it is immaterial whether the\\n  6\\n   Section 14-54, titled \"Breaking or entering buildings generally,\" pro-\\nvides in subsection (a): \"Any person who breaks or enters any building\\n\\x0c14                      UNITED STATES v. CARR\\ndefendant actually completed the crime of larceny. State v.\\nSmith, 312 S.E.2d 222, 225 (N.C. App. 1984); see also State\\nv. Jones, 157 S.E.2d 610, 611 (N.C. 1967) (\"The breaking of\\nthe store window with the requisite intent to commit a felony\\ntherein completes the offense even though the defendant is\\ninterrupted or otherwise abandons his purpose without actu-\\nally entering the building.\"). Thus, when Carr either broke\\ninto or entered each storage unit, his crime related to that unit\\nwas complete at that point regardless of whether he later\\nreturned to that unit.\\n\\n   With this in mind, we must determine if each of Carr’s\\nprior convictions arose out of a separate and distinct criminal\\nepisode. Letterlough, 63 F.3d at 335. In doing so, we consider\\n(1) whether the offenses arose in different geographic loca-\\ntions; (2) whether the nature of each offense was substan-\\ntively different; (3) whether each offense involved different\\nvictims; (4) whether each offense involved different criminal\\nobjectives; and (5) whether the defendant had the opportunity\\nafter committing the first-in-time offense to make a conscious\\nand knowing decision to engage in the next-in-time offense.\\nLeeson, 453 F.3d at 640. We can consider these factors\\ntogether or independently, and \"if any one of the factors has\\n\\nwith intent to commit any felony or larceny therein shall be punished as\\na Class H felon.\" The \"statutory offense of felonious breaking or entering\\nis a lesser included offense of burglary in the first and second degree,\"\\nState v. Jolly, 254 S.E.2d 1, 5 (N.C. 1979), which \"includes both a break-\\ning element and an entering element,\" State v. Brown, 626 S.E.2d 307, 312\\n(N.C. App. 2006). The fact that the indictments charged Carr with feloni-\\nous breaking and entering is immaterial. See State v. Reagan, 240 S.E.2d\\n805, 808 (N.C. App. 1978) (\"It has long been the law in this State in pros-\\necutions under this statute (G.S. 14-54) and its similar predecessors that\\nwhere the indictment charges the defendant with breaking and entering,\\nproof by the State of either a breaking or an entering is sufficient; and\\ninstructions allowing juries to convict on the alternative propositions are\\nproper.\") (citation and quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Arms-\\ntead, 562 S.E.2d 450, 452 (N.C. App. 2002) (noting that statutory offenses\\nthat are listed in the disjunctive are properly charged in the conjunctive).\\n\\x0c                         UNITED STATES v.

However, we are most persuaded\\nthat these crimes were separate and distinct criminal episodes\\nby the fact that (1) the crimes were committed in 13 different\\nlocations (i.e., the separate storage units), see, e.g., Tisdale,\\n921 F.2d at 1099 (\"The fact each incident occurred inside one\\nenclosed structure does not alter our conclusion that the\\ncrimes were committed at different locations\");7 (2) the\\ncrimes had 10 different victims, see, e.g., Hobbs, 136 F.3d at\\n389 (\"the fact that there were multiple victims decisively tips\\nthe scales in favor of concluding that each burglary was a sep-\\narate and distinct criminal episode\" (internal quotation marks\\nomitted)); and (3) as he committed each of the 13 crimes, Carr\\n\"had the opportunity to make a conscious and knowing deci-\\nsion to cease and desist his criminal behavior or engage in yet\\nanother crime.\" Leeson, 453 F.3d at 641.8 We believe that the\\ncombination of these factors establishes that Carr’s prior felo-\\nnies were separate and distinct criminal episodes for purposes\\nof the ACCA.\\n\\n  7\\n   The record in this case is unclear whether the 13 separate storage units\\nwere actually located within one structure.\\n  8\\n    Once Carr broke or entered into one storage unit, that crime was com-\\nplete, and he then had the opportunity to stop his criminal conduct or con-\\ntinue it by breaking or entering into another storage unit. As we noted in\\nHobbs, \"it is physically impossible for one person to commit three burgla-\\nries simultaneously at three different locations.\" 136 F.3d at 390 n.10\\n(quoting Hudspeth, 42 F.3d at 1021). Notwithstanding the difference\\nbetween burglary and felonious breaking or entering, we agree with the\\ndistrict court that this observation applies with equal force to the facts of\\nthis case: Carr simply could not have broken into or entered the 13 sepa-\\nrate storage units simultaneously.\\n\\x0c16                 UNITED STATES v.

DAVIDSON, Appellant.\\nNo. 07-1788.\\nUnited States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit.\\nSubmitted: December 12, 2007.\\nFiled: June 6, 2008.\\n*704 Bruce C. Houdek, Bruce C. Houdek, P.C., Kansas City, MO, argued, for appellant.\\nJoseph W. Vanover, Spec. Asst. U.S. Atty., Kansas City, MO, argued (John W. Wood, U.S. Atty., Lajuana M. Counts, Asst. U.S. Atty., Springfield, MO., on the brief), for appellee.\\nBefore RILEY, COLLOTON, and BENTON, Circuit Judges.\\nCOLLOTON, Circuit Judge.\\nMark Davidson was charged with one count of unlawful possession of a firearm as a previously convicted felon, in violation *705 of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). Prior to trial, he moved to suppress evidence, including a firearm seized after his arrest. The district court[1] denied the motion. A jury convicted Davidson, and the district court sentenced him to 262 months\\' imprisonment. Davidson appeals the denial of his motion to suppress and the sentence imposed. We affirm.\\n\\nI.\\nOn January 26, 2004, Officer Richard Woodley spotted a Ford Taurus, with no rear license plate, that matched the description of a vehicle reported stolen the day before. Woodley followed the vehicle, but quickly lost sight of it. A short time later, he saw the vehicle and a white man in a black hooded sweatshirt standing beside it. The man entered the car and drove away. Woodley followed and activated his lights and siren. The driver sped away, and Woodley found it abandoned a short time later.\\nWhen he located the car, Woodley saw one set of fresh footprints in the snow near the driver\\'s side, leading away from the car. A witness came out of his house and told Woodley that the driver ran in the same direction indicated by the footprints. Woodley followed the trail of footprints and found a black hooded sweatshirt in the snow.\\nDetective Greg Lewis, who was called to the scene to assist in the chase, observed Davidson standing on a street corner a few blocks from where Officer Woodley found the abandoned car. When Davidson saw Detective Lewis, he ran back in the direction of Officer Woodley. Recognizing that he was surrounded, Davidson stopped and put up his hands. No one else was in the area at the time. Woodley placed Davidson under arrest and conducted a cursory pat-down search of Davidson\\'s outer clothing.\\nAccording to evidence presented at trial, Woodley turned Davidson over to Officer John Olszowka, who put Davidson in his patrol car. On the way to the police station, Olszowka noticed that Davidson was making a lot of unusual movements in the back seat. When Olszowka stopped at the police station, he found a handgun in plain view in the back seat where Davidson had been seated.\\nDavidson was charged with one count of unlawful possession of a firearm by a previously convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). Davidson moved to suppress the firearm, claiming that the police did not have probable cause to arrest him as the driver of the stolen vehicle. A magistrate judge[2] recommended that Davidson\\'s motion be denied, finding that the footprints in the snow leading to Davidson, and Davidson\\'s flight upon seeing Detective Lewis, established probable cause that he was the driver of the vehicle. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\\'s report and recommendation, and denied Davidson\\'s motion to suppress. A jury convicted Davidson, and the district court sentenced him to 262 months\\' imprisonment. The court determined Davidson\\'s offense level according to USSG § 4B 1.4, based on a finding that Davidson was an armed career criminal for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). This determination was premised on Davidson\\'s prior convictions for sexual assault, attempted domestic assault, and resisting arrest by fleeing. (PSR ¶ 25).\\n\\n\\n*706 II.\\nDavidson first challenges the denial of his motion to suppress the handgun. He claims that the police did not have probable cause to arrest him, and that the handgun should have been suppressed as the fruit of an unconstitutional arrest. We review the district court\\'s conclusion that there was probable cause de novo, and the underlying factual determinations for clear error. Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 698-99, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). \"An officer has probable cause to make a warrantless arrest when the facts and circumstances are sufficient to lead a reasonable person to believe that the defendant has committed or is committing an offense.\" United States v. Torres-Lona, 491 F.3d 750, 755 (8th Cir.2007).\\nDavidson argues that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest, because they did not have evidence that he was the driver of the stolen vehicle. We disagree. Officer Woodley saw only one set of footprints leading away from the vehicle. While following those footprints, Woodley found a sweatshirt that was consistent with the clothing that he had witnessed on the driver of the vehicle. As Woodley continued on the trail, he saw Davidson running from Detective Lewis. There was no one else in the area. The circumstantial evidence of Davidson\\'s whereabouts in relation to the footprints, together with the consciousness of guilt suggested by Davidson\\'s flight from Detective Lewis, are sufficient to lead a reasonably prudent person to believe that Davidson had been driving the stolen vehicle. Accordingly, we conclude that there was probable cause for the arrest, and the district court correctly denied the motion to suppress.\\n\\nIII.\\nDavidson makes several challenges to his sentence, all of which relate to the district court\\'s application of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). Without an enhancement under the ACCA, the maximum term of imprisonment for a person convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm as a previously convicted felon is ten years. 18 U.S.C. § 924(a)(2). But if that person has three previous convictions for a violent felony or serious drug offense, or both, which were \"committed on occasions different from one another,\" then he is considered an \"armed career criminal\" under the ACCA, and the minimum term of imprisonment is fifteen years. 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). The district court found that Davidson had three qualifying convictions for violent felonies. In addition, under the advisory sentencing guidelines, the offense level for an armed career criminal is increased from 33 to 34 if the defendant possessed the firearm in connection with a crime of violence. The district court found that this provision applied to Davidson.\\nDavidson first argues that the district court erred in finding that he was an armed career criminal, because the sentencing enhancement was not alleged in the indictment, a jury did not find beyond a reasonable doubt that he had prior violent felony convictions, and the district court found that the sentencing enhancement applied using a preponderance of the evidence standard. These arguments are foreclosed by precedent. The fact of a prior conviction need not be charged in a felony indictment or submitted to a jury, Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 243-48, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); United States v. Campbell, 270 F.3d 702, 708 (8th Cir.2001), and the district court may find facts regarding recidivism by a preponderance of the evidence. United States v. Davis, 260 F.3d 965, 969 (8th Cir.2001).\\n*707 Davidson next contends that the district court erred in determining that his offense level was 34, according to USSG § 4B1.4(b)(3)(A). This guideline requires a finding that the defendant possessed a firearm in connection with a crime of violence. The district court found that Davidson possessed a firearm in connection with the Missouri offense of tampering with an automobile by operation, which this court has held to be a crime of violence. United States v. Bockes, 447 F.3d 1090, 1092-93 (8th Cir.2006); but cf. United States v. Henderson, 231 Fed.Appx. 531, 532 (8th Cir.2007) (holding that tampering by operation is a crime of violence), vacated, ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 2075, ___ L.Ed.2d ___ (2008) (remanding for further consideration in light of Begay v. United States, ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008)). Davidson does not dispute that his offense of tampering by operation was a crime of violence; he contends only that there was insufficient evidence to show that he was the driver of the stolen vehicle. The district court did not clearly err in determining that Davidson was the driver. The circumstantial evidence of Davidson\\'s whereabouts in relation to footprints leading from the stolen vehicle, together with his flight from law enforcement officers, was bolstered at trial by evidence that the footprints in the snow leading away from the vehicle matched the pattern on the soles on Davidson\\'s boots. This evidence is sufficient to support the district court\\'s finding.\\nFinally, Davidson argues that the district court erred in finding that his three previous convictions were committed on \"occasions different from one another,\" as required for the sentence enhancement under § 924(e). Davidson argues that his prior convictions for attempted domestic assault and resisting arrest by fleeing were committed on the same occasion. The facts surrounding the commission of these offenses are not disputed, and we review de novo the district court\\'s determination that a prior conviction is a qualifying \"violent felony.\" United States v. Mason, 440 F.3d 1056, 1057 (8th Cir.2006). We may consider both the offenses of conviction and the underlying facts to determine whether the offenses were committed on different occasions. United States v. Boyles, 235 F.3d 1057, 1057 (8th Cir.2000) (per curiam).\\nOn December 15, 2002, Davidson assaulted his girlfriend, Tricia Files, in a bar by pulling her hair and hitting her in the head with a cell phone. (PSR ¶ 39). Files then entered Davidson\\'s car, and Davidson continued to assault her as he drove. A deputy sheriff effected a traffic stop on Davidson\\'s vehicle; the record does not reflect the reason for the stop. While the officer spoke to Davidson, Files screamed that Davidson had assaulted her. (Id. at ¶ 38). The officer asked Files to get out of the vehicle, but Davidson sped away with Files in the car. Officers followed in a chase that reached speeds of over 100 miles-per-hour until Davidson was apprehended through the use of tire deflation devices.\\nWe must determine whether, under those circumstances, Davidson committed the offenses of attempted domestic assault and resisting arrest on \"occasions different from one another.\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). The statutory provision at issue has its genesis in a decision of this court. In United States v. Petty, 798 F.2d 1157 (8th Cir.1986), vacated, 481 U.S. 1034, 107 S.Ct. 1968, 95 L.Ed.2d 810 (1987), this court held that a defendant was subject to an enhanced sentence under 18 U.S.C. § 1202(a)(1) (Supp.1984), based on \"three previous convictions ... for robbery or burglary,\" when he was \"convicted in a single indictment of six counts of robbery *708 stemming from an incident during which he robbed six different people in a restaurant simultaneously.\" 798 F.2d at 1159. When Petty petitioned for a writ of certiorari, the Solicitor General confessed error, noting that \"the legislative history strongly supports the conclusion that the statute was intended to reach multiple criminal episodes that were distinct in time, not multiple felony convictions arising out of a single criminal episode.\" See United States v. Petty, 828 F.2d 2, 3 (8th Cir. 1987). The Supreme Court remanded the case to this court for reconsideration in light of the Solicitor General\\'s position, Petty, 481 U.S. at 1034-35, 107 S.Ct. 1968, and this court remanded the case for resentencing. 828 F.2d at 3.\\nThe following year, Congress amended the statute to add the requirement that a defendant must have sustained three convictions \"on occasions different from one another\" to qualify as an armed career criminal. Senator Biden, then the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, explained his view that \"a single multicount conviction could still qualify where the counts related to crimes committed on different occasions, but a robbery of multiple victims simultaneously (as in Petty) would count as only one conviction.\" 134 Cong. Rec. S17360-02 (Nov. 10, 1988). Observing that \"occasion\" has been defined as \"a particular occurrence\" or \"a particular time at which something takes place,\" the Fourth Circuit interpreted the amendment to mean that \"Congress intended to include within the scope of the ACCA only those predicate offenses that can be isolated with a beginning and an end\\x97ones that constitute an occurrence unto themselves.\" United States v. Letterlough, 63 F.3d 332, 335 (4th Cir.1995) (quoting Webster\\'s Third New International Dictionary Unabridged 1560 (1986)).\\nIn our previous decisions on this subject, we have said that offenses occur on different occasions if they are \"separate and distinct criminal episodes that did not result from a continuous course of conduct.\" United States v. Hamell, 3 F.3d 1187, 1191 (8th Cir.1993); see also United States v. Deroo, 304 F.3d 824, 828 (8th Cir.2002). In Hamell, we held that two assaults were distinct criminal episodes where the defendant stabbed one victim with a knife inside a tavern, and stabbed another victim twenty-five minutes later, after the second victim called the police and approached the defendant\\'s girlfriend. 3 F.3d at 1191. We noted that \"the assaults happened at different times and places and had different motivations.\" Id. In Deroo, we held that three burglaries on one night were distinct criminal episodes, where the defendant burglarized three cabins with different owners on different lakes. 304 F.3d at 828. We observed that the burglaries occurred in three separate places and involved three separate victims. Id. In Mason, we held that drug sales made to the same undercover officer on different dates were offenses committed on occasions different from one another. 440 F.3d at 1057-58.\\nDavidson\\'s case presents a scenario that has arisen in other circuits with varying fact patterns and varying results. The general problem is whether to treat as separate occasions or separate episodes (1) the commission of an offense designed to elude apprehension for an underlying offense (e.g., assaulting a police officer or resisting arrest) and (2) the commission of the underlying offense. This situation may arise when a police officer confronts the defendant while the underlying offense is in progress, shortly after the underlying offense has been completed, or at a later time, during a subsequent investigation of the underlying offense.\\n*709 Other circuits have struggled with this problem, reaching arguably inconsistent results with respect to similar scenarios. The earliest opinion in this category seems to be United States v. Schieman, 894 F.2d 909, 910 (7th Cir.1990), where the defendant burglarized a store and then walked three blocks to a phone booth to arrange transportation. A police officer approached the defendant at the phone booth shortly after the burglary, and the defendant assaulted the officer. Id. A divided panel held that the burglary and the assault were committed on occasions different from one another, reasoning that \"[o]nce the original crime is complete, there is no principled way to distinguish between an attack in response to an investigation commenced within ten minutes of the burglary and an attack in response to an investigation commenced a day after the burglary.\" Id. at 913. A dissenting judge argued that the offenses were committed on the same occasion, because the assault was \"closely connected in time, place, and continuity of action\" to the underlying offense. Id. at 915 (Ripple, J., dissenting) (internal quotation and citation omitted).\\nSince Schieman, at least three other circuits have addressed situations where the defendant was confronted shortly after completing the underlying offense, and then committed a second offense against the confronting party. In United States v. Ressler, 54 F.3d 257, 260 (5th Cir.1995), the Fifth Circuit considered a defendant who burglarized a home, fled when the homeowner discovered the burglary in progress, and then stabbed a neighbor who pursued the defendant and caught him after eight to twelve minutes. The court held that the housebreaking and the assault were committed on occasions different from one another, because the crimes were \"`committed sequentially, against different victims, at different times, and at different locations.\\'\" Id. (quoting United States v. Hudspeth, 42 F.3d 1015, 1022 (7th Cir.1994) (en banc)).\\nThe Sixth Circuit reached a different conclusion in the case of a defendant who burglarized a home, encountered police officers as he walked out of a wooded area near the home, fled into the woods, and pointed a gun at a police officer who pursued him. United States v. Graves, 60 F.3d 1183, 1184-85 (6th Cir.1995). The defendant was convicted of burglary and assault, and the Sixth Circuit held that the offenses were not committed on occasions different from one another. Id. at 1187. The court observed that the defendant was still at the location of the burglary when he was chased by the police and then pointed a gun at an officer. Id. The court distinguished the situation in Schieman, where the defendant assaulted an officer at a phone booth three blocks away from the burglary, and concluded that Graves was more analogous to Petty, where the defendant simultaneously robbed multiple victims. Id.[3]\\n*710 The Fourth Circuit then reached the opposite conclusion in a case that appears materially indistinguishable from Graves. In United States v. Leeson, 453 F.3d 631, 639-40 (4th Cir.2006), the defendant robbed a food store, and when he exited the store, a police officer confronted the defendant and ordered him to stop. The defendant raised a shotgun and fired at the officer. Id. at 640. He eventually was convicted of robbery and attempted murder of the police officer. Id. at 639. The Fourth Circuit held that two offenses were committed on occasions different from one another, because they involved distinctly different victims and distinctly different crimes, and because the defendant was presented with a clear opportunity to cease and desist his criminal behavior before the second crime. Id. at 641-42. The court acknowledged the decision in Graves, but simply disagreed with it. Id. at 643 n.5.\\nConsidering these decisions and the record in this case, we agree with the district court that Davidson committed the offenses of attempted domestic assault and resisting arrest by fleeing on occasions different from one another. The record shows that when the deputy sheriff stopped Davidson\\'s vehicle for unspecified reasons, Davidson\\'s attempted assault on his girlfriend was completed. The first criminal episode had concluded, and the traffic stop represented a discernible pause in activity during which Davidson had an opportunity to cease and desist from further criminal activity. But when his girlfriend reported Davidson\\'s assault, Davidson elected to resist arrest and flee the scene. The pause between the two offenses was brief, but crimes committed in rapid succession are still committed on different occasions when they \"reflect distinct aggressions.\" United States v. Godinez, 998 F.2d 471, 472-73 (7th Cir.1993). Davidson\\'s attempted assault of his girlfriend and his reckless flight while resisting arrest were distinct criminal episodes reflecting distinct aggressions. His offense of resisting arrest by fleeing also was committed at locations different from where he attempted to assault his girlfriend, and it involved distinctly different victims, beyond even those investigating the underlying assault\\x97namely, members of the public endangered by the high-speed flight from police. We do not view these offenses as part of a continuous course of conduct like the simultaneous robbery of six persons in a restaurant in Petty. And the moment of relative calm presented by the deputy sheriff\\'s traffic stop of Davidson strikes us as a point of demarcation between episodes that was not present in either Graves or Leeson, two cases that have spawned a disagreement among our sister circuits. We therefore conclude that these two violent felonies were properly counted as separate prior convictions for purposes of the sentencing enhancement provision in § 924(e).\\n\\n* * *\\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\\nNOTES\\n[1]  The Honorable Gary A. Fenner, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.\\n[2]  The Honorable Robert E. Larsen, United States Magistrate Judge for the Western District of Missouri.\\n[3]  Graves also relied on the decision in United States v. Sweeting, 933 F.2d 962 (11th Cir. 1991), which involved a defendant who burglarized one home, fled to another home when the police approached, and hid in a closet to escape detection by the police. Id. at 967. The Eleventh Circuit reversed the district court\\'s classification of Sweeting as an armed career criminal, saying that \"this should count as only one conviction for purposes of sentencing, as it constitutes a single episode even though there were separate punishable acts.\" Id. The opinion did not specify, however, that Sweeting sustained three separate convictions under state law for the series of punishable acts, or what separate offenses may have been committed. Elsewhere, the court stated that Sweeting\\'s \"one prior adult conviction in 1986 reflected several counts which all arose from the same incident,\" and that Sweeting asserted \"that he was convicted only once and not several times for the same offense.\" Id. (emphases added). Whether Sweeting sustained three separate convictions is therefore unclear, but the Eleventh Circuit did indicate that it would not treat three offenses arising from this scenario as committed on occasions different from one another for purposes of § 924(e).\\n'}]\n",

United States v. Davidson, 527 F.3d\\n703 (8th Cir. 2008). Davidson then filed a petition for rehearing, arguing that in light\\nof intervening precedent, the offense of tampering with an automobile by operation\\nin Missouri is not a “crime of violence” for purposes of USSG § 4B1.2(a). As a\\nconsequence, he contends, the applicable offense level under the advisory guidelines\\nfor his offense of conviction should have been 33 rather than 34. See USSG\\n§ 4B1.4(b). With a reduced offense level, the advisory guideline range would have\\n\\x0cbeen 235 to 293 months’ imprisonment, rather than 262 to 327 months’ imprisonment,\\nand Davidson argues that there is a reasonable probability that the district court would\\nhave imposed a shorter term of imprisonment if the court had used the lower range as\\na starting point for its analysis.\\n\\n        After this case was submitted, the Supreme Court decided Begay v. United\\nStates, 128 S. Ct. 1581 (2008), which held that the offense of driving under the\\ninfluence in New Mexico was not a “violent felony” within the meaning of 18 U.S.C.\\n§ 924(e). After our opinion was filed in this case, another panel of this court, relying\\non Begay, overruled circuit precedent and held that auto tampering by operation in\\nMissouri is not a crime of violence under USSG § 4B1.2. United States v. Williams,\\n537 F.3d 969, 974-75 (8th Cir.), reh’g denied, 546 F.3d 961 (8th Cir. 2008). In light\\nof this intervening decision, we grant Davidson’s petition for rehearing. See United\\nStates v. Byers, 740 F.2d 1104, 1115 n.11 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (plurality opinion) (Scalia,\\nJ.); id. at 1161 n.138 (Bazelon, J., dissenting); Lowry v. Bankers Life & Cas. Ret.\\nPlan, 871 F.2d 522, 523 n.1 (5th Cir. 1989) (per curiam); cf. United States v. Maynie,\\n257 F.3d 908, 908 n.1 (8th Cir. 2001) (allowing supplemental briefing after oral\\nargument in light of intervening precedent); United States v. Poulack, 236 F.3d 932,\\n935 (8th Cir. 2001) (allowing pre-argument supplemental briefing based on\\nintervening precedent).\\n\\n       Under current law, it was plain error for the district court to conclude that\\nDavidson’s commission of tampering by operation was a crime of violence. There is\\na reasonable probability (though not a certainty) that a reduced advisory range would\\nhave influenced the district court to impose a more lenient sentence, given that the\\nadvisory range remains a “starting point and the initial benchmark” in a sentencing\\nproceeding, and the use of an incorrect advisory range is a “significant procedural\\nerror.” Gall v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 586, 596-97 (2007). Accordingly, we\\nconclude that relief is warranted under the standard for plain error review. See United\\nStates v. Armstead, 546 F.3d 1097, 1112 (9th Cir. 2008); United States v. Lee, 288 F.\\n\\n                                          -2-\\n\\x0cApp’x 264, 272 (6th Cir. 2008); see generally United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725\\n(1993); United States v. Pirani, 406 F.3d 543, 553-54 (8th Cir. 2005) (en banc). The\\ngovernment contends that if Davidson had objected to the conclusion that tampering\\nby operation was a crime of violence, then it could have produced additional evidence\\nthat Davidson was committing a different crime of violence. The district court may\\nconsider any such evidence on remand. United States v. Cornelius, 968 F.2d 703, 705\\n(8th Cir. 1992).\\n\\n        This court’s judgment of June 6, 2008 is vacated. For the reasons set forth in\\nour prior opinion, Davidson’s conviction is affirmed, and we uphold the district\\ncourt’s decision to classify Davidson as an armed career criminal pursuant to 18\\nU.S.C. § 924(e). The prior opinion is vacated only to the extent that it affirmed the\\ndistrict court’s judgment in its entirety; the opinion remains in place with respect to\\nall issues raised and decided therein. Because of the intervening decision in Williams,\\nwe vacate Davidson’s sentence and remand for further proceedings consistent with\\nthis opinion.\\n\\nRILEY, Circuit Judge, concurring.\\n\\n      I continue to agree with Judge Colloton’s dissent from denial of rehearing en\\nbanc in United States v.

DAVIS ET AL.\\n\\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\\n                  THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\\n\\n       No. 18–431.      Argued April 17, 2019—Decided June 24, 2019\\nRespondents Maurice Davis and Andre Glover were charged with mul-\\n  tiple counts of Hobbs Act robbery and one count of conspiracy to\\n  commit Hobbs Act robbery. They were also charged under 18 U. S. C.\\n  §924(c), which authorizes heightened criminal penalties for using,\\n  carrying, or possessing a firearm in connection with any federal\\n  “crime of violence or drug trafficking crime.” §924(c)(1)(A). “Crime of\\n  violence” is defined in two subparts: the elements clause,\\n  §924(c)(3)(A), and the residual clause, §924(c)(3)(B). The residual\\n  clause in turn defines a “crime of violence” as a felony “that by its na-\\n  ture, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the per-\\n  son or property of another may be used in the course of committing\\n  the offense.” Ibid. A jury convicted the men on most of the underly-\\n  ing charges and on two separate §924(c) charges for brandishing a\\n  firearm in connection with their crimes. The Fifth Circuit initially\\n  rejected their argument that §924(c)’s residual clause is unconstitu-\\n  tionally vague, but on remand in light of Sessions v. Dimaya, 584\\n  U. S. ___, the court reversed course and held §924(c)(3)(B) unconsti-\\n  tutional. It then held that Mr. Davis’s and Mr. Glover’s convictions\\n  on the §924(c) count charging robbery as the predicate crime of vio-\\n  lence could be sustained under the elements clause, but that the oth-\\n  er count—which charged conspiracy as a predicate crime of vio-\\n  lence—could not be upheld because it depended on the residual\\n  clause.\\nHeld: Section 924(c)(3)(B) is unconstitutionally vague. Pp. 4–25.\\n    (a) In our constitutional order, a vague law is no law at all. The\\n vagueness doctrine rests on the twin constitutional pillars of due pro-\\n cess and separation of powers. This Court has recently applied the\\n doctrine in two cases involving statutes that bear more than a pass-\\n\\x0c2                       UNITED STATES v. DAVIS\\n\\n                                   Syllabus\\n\\n    ing resemblance to §924(c)(3)(B)’s residual clause—Johnson v. United\\n    States, 576 U. S. ___, which addressed the residual clause of the\\n    Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), and Sessions v. Dimaya, which\\n    addressed the residual clause of 18 U. S. C. §16. The residual clause\\n    in each case required judges to use a “categorical approach” to deter-\\n    mine whether an offense qualified as a violent felony or crime of vio-\\n    lence. Judges had to disregard how the defendant actually commit-\\n    ted the offense and instead imagine the degree of risk that would\\n    attend the idealized “ ‘ordinary case’ ” of the offense. Johnson, 576\\n    U. S., at ___. The Court held in each case that the imposition of crim-\\n    inal punishments cannot be made to depend on a judge’s estimation\\n    of the degree of risk posed by a crime’s imagined “ordinary case.” The\\n    government and lower courts have long understood §924(c)(3)(B) to\\n    require the same categorical approach. Now, the government asks\\n    this Court to abandon the traditional categorical approach and hold\\n    that the statute commands a case-specific approach that would look\\n    at the defendant’s actual conduct in the predicate crime. The gov-\\n    ernment’s case-specific approach would avoid the vagueness prob-\\n    lems that doomed the statutes in Johnson and Dimaya and would not\\n    yield to the same practical and Sixth Amendment complications that\\n    a case-specific approach under the ACCA and §16 would, but this ap-\\n    proach finds no support in §924(c)’s text, context, and history. Pp. 4–\\n    9.\\n       (b) This Court has already read the nearly identical language of\\n    §16(b) to mandate a categorical approach. See Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543\\n    U. S. 1, 7. And what is true of §16(b) seems at least as true of\\n    §924(c)(3)(B). The government claims that the singular term “of-\\n    fense” carries the “generic” meaning in connection with the elements\\n    clause but a “specific act” meaning in connection with the residual\\n    clause, but nothing in §924(c)(3)(B) rebuts the presumption that the\\n    single term “offense” bears a consistent meaning. This reading is re-\\n    inforced by the language of the residual clause itself, which speaks of\\n    an offense that, “by its nature,” involves a certain type of risk. Pp. 9–\\n    12.\\n       (c) The categorical reading is also reinforced by §924(c)(3)(B)’s role\\n    in the broader context of the federal criminal code. Dozens of federal\\n    statutes use the phrase “crime of violence” to refer to presently\\n    charged conduct. Some cross-reference §924(c)(3)’s definition, while\\n    others are governed by the virtually identical definition in §16. The\\n    choice appears completely random. To hold that §16(b) requires the\\n    categorical approach while §924(c)(3)(B) requires the case-specific\\n    approach would make a hash of the federal criminal code. Pp. 12–13.\\n       (d) Section 924(c)(3)(B)’s history provides still further evidence that\\n    it carries the same categorical-approach command as §16(b).

S. ____ (2019)                     3\\n\\n                                Syllabus\\n\\n  Congress enacted the definition of “crime of violence” in §16 in 1984,\\n  it also employed the term in numerous places in the Act, including\\n  §924(c). The two statutes, thus, were originally designed to be read\\n  together. And when Congress added a definition of “crime of vio-\\n  lence” to §924(c) in 1986, it copied the definition from §16 without\\n  making any material changes to the language of the residual clause,\\n  which would have been a bizarre way of suggesting that the two\\n  clauses should bear drastically different meanings.            Moreover,\\n  §924(c) originally prohibited the use of a firearm in connection with\\n  any federal felony, before Congress narrowed §924(c) in 1984 by lim-\\n  iting its predicate offenses to “crimes of violence.” The case-specific\\n  reading would go a long way toward nullifying that limitation and re-\\n  storing the statute’s original breadth. Pp. 14–17.\\n     (e) Relying on the canon of constitutional avoidance, the govern-\\n  ment insists that if the case-specific approach does not represent the\\n  best reading of the statute, it is nevertheless the Court’s duty to\\n  adopt any “fairly possible” reading to save the statute from being un-\\n  constitutional. But it is doubtful the canon could play a proper role\\n  in this case even if the government’s reading were “possible.” This\\n  Court has sometimes adopted the narrower construction of a criminal\\n  statute to avoid having to hold it unconstitutional if it were construed\\n  more broadly, but it has not invoked the canon to expand the reach of\\n  a criminal statute in order to save it. To do so would risk offending\\n  the very same due process and separation of powers principles on\\n  which the vagueness doctrine itself rests and would sit uneasily with\\n  the rule of lenity’s teaching that ambiguities about a criminal stat-\\n  ute’s breadth should be resolved in the defendant’s favor.

MAURICE LAMONT\\n      DAVIS AND ANDRE LEVON GLOVER\\n ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF\\n            APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT\\n                                 [June 24, 2019]\\n\\n  JUSTICE GORSUCH delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n  In our constitutional order, a vague law is no law at all.\\nOnly the people’s elected representatives in Congress have\\nthe power to write new federal criminal laws. And when\\nCongress exercises that power, it has to write statutes\\nthat give ordinary people fair warning about what the law\\ndemands of them. Vague laws transgress both of those\\nconstitutional requirements. They hand off the legisla-\\nture’s responsibility for defining criminal behavior to\\nunelected prosecutors and judges, and they leave people\\nwith no sure way to know what consequences will attach\\nto their conduct. When Congress passes a vague law, the\\nrole of courts under our Constitution is not to fashion a\\nnew, clearer law to take its place, but to treat the law as a\\nnullity and invite Congress to try again.\\n  Today we apply these principles to 18 U. S. C. §924(c).\\nThat statute threatens long prison sentences for anyone\\nwho uses a firearm in connection with certain other federal\\ncrimes. But which other federal crimes? The statute’s\\nresidual clause points to those felonies “that by [their]\\nnature, involv[e] a substantial risk that physical force\\n\\x0c2                 UNITED STATES v. DAVIS\\n\\n                     Opinion of the Court\\n\\nagainst the person or property of another may be used in\\nthe course of committing the offense.” §924(c)(3)(B). Even\\nthe government admits that this language, read in the\\nway nearly everyone (including the government) has long\\nunderstood it, provides no reliable way to determine which\\noffenses qualify as crimes of violence and thus is unconsti-\\ntutionally vague. So today the government attempts a\\nnew and alternative reading designed to save the residual\\nclause. But this reading, it turns out, cannot be squared\\nwith the statute’s text, context, and history. Were we to\\nadopt it, we would be effectively stepping outside our role\\nas judges and writing a new law rather than applying the\\none Congress adopted.\\n                              I\\n  After Maurice Davis and Andre Glover committed a\\nstring of gas station robberies in Texas, a federal prosecu-\\ntor charged both men with multiple counts of robbery\\naffecting interstate commerce in violation of the Hobbs\\nAct, 18 U. S. C. §1951(a), and one count of conspiracy to\\ncommit Hobbs Act robbery. The prosecutor also charged\\nMr. Davis with being a felon in possession of a firearm. In\\nthe end, a jury acquitted Mr. Davis of one robbery charge\\nand otherwise found the men guilty on all counts. And\\nthese convictions, none of which are challenged here,\\nauthorized the court to impose prison sentences of up to 70\\nyears for Mr. Davis and up to 100 years for Mr. Glover.\\n  But that was not all. This appeal concerns additional\\ncharges the government pursued against the men under\\n§924(c). That statute authorizes heightened criminal\\npenalties for using or carrying a firearm “during and in\\nrelation to,” or possessing a firearm “in furtherance of,”\\nany federal “crime of violence or drug trafficking crime.”\\n§924(c)(1)(A). The statute proceeds to define the term\\n“crime of violence” in two subparts—the first known as the\\nelements clause, and the second the residual clause.\\n\\x0c                     Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2019)                     3\\n\\n                          Opinion of the Court\\n\\nAccording to §924(c)(3), a crime of violence is “an offense\\nthat is a felony” and\\n     “(A) has as an element the use, attempted use, or\\n     threatened use of physical force against the person or\\n     property of another, or\\n     “(B) that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that\\n     physical force against the person or property of an-\\n     other may be used in the course of committing the\\n     offense.”\\nViolators of §924(c) face a mandatory minimum sentence\\nof five years in prison, over and above any sentence they\\nreceive for the underlying crime of violence or drug traf-\\nficking crime. The minimum sentence rises to 7 years if\\nthe defendant brandishes the firearm and 10 years if he\\ndischarges it. Certain types of weapons also trigger en-\\nhanced penalties—for example, a defendant who uses a\\nshort-barreled shotgun faces a minimum sentence of 10\\nyears. And repeat violations of §924(c) carry a minimum\\nsentence of 25 years.1\\n   At trial, the government argued that Mr. Davis and Mr.\\nGlover had each committed two separate §924(c) violations\\nby brandishing a short-barreled shotgun in connection\\nwith their crimes. Here, too, the jury agreed. These con-\\nvictions yielded a mandatory minimum sentence for each\\nman of 35 years, which had to run consecutively to their\\nother sentences. Adding the §924(c) mandatory mini-\\nmums to its discretionary sentences for their other crimes,\\nthe district court ultimately sentenced Mr. Glover to more\\n——————\\n   1 When this case was tried, a defendant convicted of two §924(c) viola-\\n\\ntions in a single prosecution faced a 25-year minimum for the second\\nviolation. See Deal v. United States, 508 U. S. 129, 132 (1993); §1(a)(1),\\n112 Stat. 3469. In 2018, Congress changed the law so that, going\\nforward, only a second §924(c) violation committed “after a prior\\n[§924(c)] conviction . . . has become final” will trigger the 25-year\\nminimum.

At first, the Fifth\\nCircuit rejected the argument. United States v. Davis, 677\\nFed. Appx. 933, 936 (2017) (per curiam). But after we\\nvacated its judgment and remanded for further considera-\\ntion in light of our decision in Sessions v. Dimaya, 584\\nU. S. ___ (2018), striking down a different, almost identi-\\ncally worded statute, the court reversed course and held\\n§924(c)(3)(B) unconstitutional. 903 F. 3d 483, 486 (2018)\\n(per curiam). It then held that Mr. Davis’s and Mr. Glov-\\ner’s convictions on one of the two §924(c) counts, the one\\nthat charged robbery as a predicate crime of violence,\\ncould be sustained under the elements clause. But it held\\nthat the other count, which charged conspiracy as a predi-\\ncate crime of violence, depended on the residual clause;\\nand so it vacated the men’s convictions and sentences on\\nthat count.\\n   Because the Fifth Circuit’s ruling deepened a dispute\\namong the lower courts about the constitutionality of\\n§924(c)’s residual clause, we granted certiorari to resolve\\nthe question. 586 U.

Vague laws contravene the “first\\nessential of due process of law” that statutes must give\\npeople “of common intelligence” fair notice of what the law\\ndemands of them. Connally v. General Constr. Co., 269\\nU. S. 385, 391 (1926); see Collins v. Kentucky, 234 U. S.\\n634, 638 (1914). Vague laws also undermine the Constitu-\\ntion’s separation of powers and the democratic self-\\ngovernance it aims to protect. Only the people’s elected\\nrepresentatives in the legislature are authorized to “make\\nan act a crime.” United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 32, 34\\n(1812). Vague statutes threaten to hand responsibility for\\ndefining crimes to relatively unaccountable police, prose-\\ncutors, and judges, eroding the people’s ability to oversee\\nthe creation of the laws they are expected to abide. See\\nKolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 357–358, and n. 7\\n(1983); United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U. S.\\n81, 89–91 (1921); United States v. Reese, 92 U. S. 214, 221\\n(1876).\\n   In recent years, this Court has applied these principles\\nto two statutes that bear more than a passing resemblance\\nto §924(c)(3)(B)’s residual clause. In Johnson v. United\\nStates, 576 U. S. ___ (2015), the Court addressed the\\nresidual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA),\\nwhich defined a “violent felony” to include offenses that\\npresented a “serious potential risk of physical injury to\\nanother.” §924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The ACCA’s residual clause\\nrequired judges to use a form of what we’ve called the\\n“categorical approach” to determine whether an offense\\nqualified as a violent felony. Following the categorical\\napproach, judges had to disregard how the defendant\\nactually committed his crime. Instead, they were required\\nto imagine the idealized “ ‘ordinary case’ ” of the defend-\\nant’s crime and then guess whether a “ ‘serious potential\\nrisk of physical injury to another’ ” would attend its com-\\nmission. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4). Johnson held this\\n\\x0c6                     UNITED STATES v. DAVIS\\n\\n                          Opinion of the Court\\n\\njudicial inquiry produced “more unpredictability and\\narbitrariness” when it comes to specifying unlawful con-\\nduct than the Constitution allows. Id., at ___–___ (slip op.,\\nat 5–6).\\n   Next, in Sessions v. Dimaya, we considered the residual\\nclause of 18 U. S. C. §16, which defines a “crime of vio-\\nlence” for purposes of many federal statutes.           Like\\n§924(c)(3), §16 contains an elements clause and a residual\\nclause. The only difference is that §16’s elements clause,\\nunlike §924(c)(3)’s elements clause, isn’t limited to felo-\\nnies; but there’s no material difference in the language or\\nscope of the statutes’ residual clauses.3 As with the\\nACCA, our precedent under §16’s residual clause required\\ncourts to use the categorical approach to determine\\nwhether an offense qualified as a crime of violence. Di-\\nmaya, 584 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 2–3); see Leocal v.\\nAshcroft, 543 U. S. 1, 7, 10 (2004). And, again as with the\\nACCA, we held that §16’s residual clause was unconstitu-\\ntionally vague because it required courts “to picture the\\nkind of conduct that the crime involves in the ordinary\\ncase, and to judge whether that abstraction presents some\\nnot-well-specified-yet-sufficiently-large degree of risk.”\\nDimaya, 584 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (internal quota-\\ntion marks omitted).\\n   What do Johnson and Dimaya have to say about the\\nstatute before us? Those decisions teach that the imposi-\\ntion of criminal punishment can’t be made to depend on a\\njudge’s estimation of the degree of risk posed by a crime’s\\nimagined “ordinary case.” But does §924(c)(3)(B) require\\nthat sort of inquiry? The government and lower courts\\n——————\\n   3 Section 16 provides that the term “crime of violence” means “(a) an\\n\\noffense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened\\nuse of physical force against the person or property of another, or\\n(b) any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a\\nsubstantial risk that physical force against the person or property of\\nanother may be used in the course of committing the offense.”\\n\\x0c                    Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2019)                  7\\n\\n                        Opinion of the Court\\n\\nhave long thought so. For years, almost everyone under-\\nstood §924(c)(3)(B) to require exactly the same categorical\\napproach that this Court found problematic in the residual\\nclauses of the ACCA and §16.4 Today, the government\\nacknowledges that, if this understanding is correct, then\\n§924(c)(3)(B) must be held unconstitutional too.\\n   But the government thinks it has now found a way\\naround the problem. In the aftermath of our decisions\\nholding the residual clauses of the ACCA and §16(b) un-\\nconstitutionally vague, the government “abandon[ed] its\\nlongstanding position” that §924(c)(3)(B) requires a cate-\\ngorical analysis and began urging lower courts to “adopt a\\nnew ‘case specific’ method” that would look to “the ‘de-\\nfendant’s actual conduct’ in the predicate offense.” 903\\nF. 3d, at 485. Now, the government tries the same strat-\\negy in this Court, asking us to abandon the traditional\\ncategorical approach and hold that the statute actually\\ncommands the government’s new case-specific approach.\\nSo, while the consequences in this case may be of constitu-\\ntional dimension, the real question before us turns out to\\nbe one of pure statutory interpretation.\\n   In approaching the parties’ dispute over the statute’s\\nmeaning, we begin by acknowledging that the government\\n——————\\n  4 See, e.g., United States v.

DAVIS\\n\\n                      Opinion of the Court\\n\\nis right about at least two things. First, a case-specific\\napproach would avoid the vagueness problems that\\ndoomed the statutes in Johnson and Dimaya. In those\\ncases, we recognized that there would be no vagueness\\nproblem with asking a jury to decide whether a defend-\\nant’s “ ‘real-world conduct’ ” created a substantial risk of\\nphysical violence. Dimaya, 584 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op.,\\nat 10–11); see Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 6,\\n12). Second, a case-specific approach wouldn’t yield the\\nsame practical and Sixth Amendment complications under\\n§924(c) that it would have under the ACCA or §16. Those\\nother statutes, in at least some of their applications, re-\\nquired a judge to determine whether a defendant’s prior\\nconviction was for a “crime of violence” or “violent felony.”\\nIn that context, a case-specific approach would have en-\\ntailed “reconstruct[ing], long after the original conviction,\\nthe conduct underlying that conviction.” Id., at ___ (slip\\nop., at 13). And having a judge, not a jury, make findings\\nabout that underlying conduct would have “raise[d] seri-\\nous Sixth Amendment concerns.” Descamps v. United\\nStates, 570 U. S. 254, 269–270 (2013). By contrast, a\\n§924(c) prosecution focuses on the conduct with which the\\ndefendant is currently charged. The government already\\nhas to prove to a jury that the defendant committed all the\\nacts necessary to punish him for the underlying crime of\\nviolence or drug trafficking crime. So it wouldn’t be that\\ndifficult to ask the jury to make an additional finding\\nabout whether the defendant’s conduct also created a\\nsubstantial risk that force would be used.\\n  But all this just tells us that it might have been a good\\nidea for Congress to have written a residual clause for\\n§924(c) using a case-specific approach. It doesn’t tell us\\nwhether Congress actually wrote such a clause. To an-\\nswer that question, we need to examine the statute’s text,\\ncontext, and history. And when we do that, it becomes\\nclear that the statute simply cannot support the govern-\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 588 U.

S. C. §16(b) to mandate\\na categorical approach. And, importantly, the Court did so\\nwithout so much as mentioning the practical and constitu-\\ntional concerns described above. Instead, the Court got\\nthere based entirely on the text. In Leocal, the Court\\nwrote:\\n    “In determining whether petitioner’s conviction falls\\n    within the ambit of §16, the statute directs our focus\\n    to the ‘offense’ of conviction. See §16(a) (defining a\\n    crime of violence as ‘an offense that has as an element\\n    the use . . . of physical force against the person or\\n    property of another’ (emphasis added)); §16(b) (defin-\\n    ing the term as ‘any other offense that is a felony and\\n    that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that\\n    physical force against the person or property of an-\\n    other may be used in the course of committing the\\n    offense’ (emphasis added)). This language requires us\\n    to look to the elements and the nature of the offense of\\n    conviction, rather than to the particular facts relating\\n    to petitioner’s crime.” 543 U. S., at 7.\\nLeocal went on to suggest that burglary would always be a\\ncrime of violence under §16(b) “because burglary, by its\\nnature, involves a substantial risk that the burglar will\\nuse force against a victim in completing the crime,” re-\\ngardless of how any particular burglar might act on a\\nspecific occasion. Id., at 10 (emphasis added); see also\\nDimaya, 584 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (plurality opin-\\nion) (reaffirming that “§16(b)’s text . . . demands a categor-\\nical approach”). And what was true of §16(b) seems to us\\n\\x0c10                UNITED STATES v. DAVIS\\n\\n                     Opinion of the Court\\n\\nat least as true of §924(c)(3)(B): It’s not even close; the\\nstatutory text commands the categorical approach.\\n   Consider the word “offense.” It’s true that “in ordinary\\nspeech,” this word can carry at least two possible mean-\\nings. It can refer to “a generic crime, say, the crime of\\nfraud or theft in general,” or it can refer to “the specific\\nacts in which an offender engaged on a specific occasion.”\\nNijhawan v. Holder, 557 U. S. 29, 33–34 (2009). But the\\nword “offense” appears just once in §924(c)(3), in the stat-\\nute’s prefatory language. And everyone agrees that, in\\nconnection with the elements clause, the term “offense”\\ncarries the first, “generic” meaning. Cf. id., at 36 (similar\\nlanguage of the ACCA’s elements clause “refers directly to\\ngeneric crimes”). So reading this statute most naturally,\\nwe would expect “offense” to retain that same meaning in\\nconnection with the residual clause. After all, “[i]n all but\\nthe most unusual situations, a single use of a statutory\\nphrase must have a fixed meaning.” Cochise Consultancy,\\nInc. v. United States ex rel. Hunt, 587 U. S. ___, ___ (2019)\\n(slip op., at 5).\\n   To prevail, the government admits it must persuade us\\nthat the singular term “offense” bears a split personality\\nin §924(c), carrying the “generic” meaning in connection\\nwith the elements clause but then taking on the “specific\\nact” meaning in connection with the residual clause. And,\\nthe government suggests, this isn’t quite as implausible as\\nit may sound; sometimes the term “offense” can carry both\\nmeanings simultaneously. To illustrate its point, the\\ngovernment posits a statute defining a “youthful gun\\ncrime” as “an offense that has as an element the use of a\\ngun and is committed by someone under the age of 21.”\\nTr. of Oral Arg. 16. This statute, the government sug-\\ngests, would leave us little choice but to understand the\\nsingle word “offense” as encompassing both the generic\\ncrime and the manner of its commission on a specific\\noccasion. To which we say: Fair enough. It’s possible for\\n\\x0c                     Cite as: 588 U.

But absent evidence to the contrary, we\\npresume the term is being used consistently. And nothing\\nin §924(c)(3)(B) comes close to rebutting that presumption.\\n   Just the opposite. The language of the residual clause\\nitself reinforces the conclusion that the term “offense”\\ncarries the same “generic” meaning throughout the stat-\\nute. Section 924(c)(3)(B), just like §16(b), speaks of an\\noffense that, “by its nature,” involves a certain type of risk.\\nAnd that would be an exceedingly strange way of referring\\nto the circumstances of a specific offender’s conduct. As\\nboth sides agree, the “nature” of a thing typically denotes\\nits “ ‘normal and characteristic quality,’ ” Dimaya, 584\\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting Webster’s Third New\\nInternational Dictionary 1507 (2002)), or its “ ‘basic or\\ninherent features,’ ” United States v. Barrett, 903 F. 3d\\n166, 182 (CA2 2018) (quoting Oxford Dictionary of English\\n1183 (A. Stevenson ed., 3d ed. 2010)). So in plain English,\\nwhen we speak of the nature of an offense, we’re talking\\nabout “what an offense normally—or, as we have repeat-\\nedly said, ‘ordinarily’—entails, not what happened to occur\\non one occasion.” Dimaya, 584 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\\n14); see Leocal, 543 U. S., at 7 (contrasting the “nature of\\nthe offense” with “the particular facts [of] petitioner’s\\ncrime”).5\\n   Once again, the government asks us to overlook this\\nobvious reading of the text in favor of a strained one. It\\nsuggests that the statute might be referring to the “na-\\n——————\\n  5 The government’s own regulations reflect this understanding of the\\nordinary meaning of “by its nature.” A Department of Justice regula-\\ntion provides that an inmate is not eligible for early release if he was\\nconvicted of an offense “that, by its nature or conduct, presents a\\nserious potential risk of physical force.” 28 CFR §550.55(b)(5)(iii)\\n(2017) (emphasis added); see Bush v. Pitzer, 133 F. 3d 455, 458 (CA7\\n1997) (denying early release because “[c]onspiracy does not by its\\n‘nature’ present a serious risk; but Bush’s ‘conduct’ did so”).\\n\\x0c12                UNITED STATES v.

But even without the words “by its nature,”\\nnothing in the statute remotely suggests that courts are\\nallowed to consider character evidence—a type of evidence\\nusually off-limits during the guilt phase of a criminal trial.\\nCf. Fed. Rule Evid. 404.\\n                               B\\n  Things become clearer yet when we consider\\n§924(c)(3)(B)’s role in the broader context of the federal\\ncriminal code.      As we’ve explained, the language of\\n§924(c)(3)(B) is almost identical to the language of §16(b),\\nwhich this Court has read to mandate a categorical ap-\\nproach. And we normally presume that the same lan-\\nguage in related statutes carries a consistent meaning.\\nSee, e.g., Sullivan v. Stroop, 496 U. S. 478, 484 (1990).\\n  This case perfectly illustrates why we do that. There\\nare dozens of federal statutes that use the phrase “crime of\\nviolence” to refer to presently charged conduct rather than\\na past conviction. Some of those statutes cross-reference\\nthe definition of “crime of violence” in §924(c)(3), while\\nothers are governed by the virtually identical definition in\\n§16. The choice appears completely random. Reading the\\nsimilar language in §924(c)(3)(B) and §16(b) similarly\\nyields sensibly congruent applications across all these\\nother statutes. But if we accepted the government’s invi-\\ntation to reinterpret §924(c)(3)(B) as alone endorsing a\\ncase-specific approach, we would produce a series of seem-\\ningly inexplicable results.\\n  Take just a few examples. If the government were right,\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 588 U.

S. C. §844(o), but the (now-\\ninvalidated) categorical approach in a prosecution for\\nproviding information about explosives to facilitate a\\ncrime of violence, §842(p)(2). It would have mandated the\\ncase-specific approach in a prosecution for using false\\nidentification documents in connection with a crime of\\nviolence, §1028(b)(3)(B), but the categorical approach in a\\nprosecution for using confidential phone records in connec-\\ntion with a crime of violence, §1039(e)(1). It would have\\nmandated the case-specific approach in a prosecution for\\ngiving someone a firearm to use in a crime of violence,\\n§924(h), but the categorical approach in a prosecution for\\ngiving a minor a handgun to use in a crime of violence,\\n§924(a)(6)(B)(ii). It would have mandated the case-specific\\napproach in a prosecution for traveling to another State to\\nacquire a firearm for use in a crime of violence, §924(g),\\nbut the categorical approach in a prosecution for traveling\\nto another State to commit a crime of violence, §1952(a)(2).\\nAnd it would have mandated the case-specific approach in\\na prosecution for carrying armor-piercing ammunition in\\nconnection with a crime of violence, §924(c)(5), but the\\ncategorical approach in a prosecution for carrying a fire-\\narm while “in possession of armor piercing ammunition\\ncapable of being fired in that firearm” in connection with a\\ncrime of violence, §929(a)(1).\\n   There would be no rhyme or reason to any of this. Nor\\ndoes the government offer any plausible account why\\nCongress would have wanted courts to take such dramati-\\ncally different approaches to classifying offenses as crimes\\nof violence in these various provisions. To hold, as the\\ngovernment urges, that §16(b) requires the categorical\\napproach while §924(c)(3)(B) requires the case-specific\\napproach would make a hash of the federal criminal code.\\n\\x0c14                 UNITED STATES v.

It’s no accident that the language of the\\ntwo laws is almost exactly the same. The statutory term\\n“crime of violence” traces its origins to the Comprehensive\\nCrime Control Act of 1984. There, Congress enacted the\\ndefinition of “crime of violence” in §16. §1001(a), 98 Stat.\\n2136. It also “employed the term ‘crime of violence’ in\\nnumerous places in the Act,” Leocal, 543 U. S., at 6, in-\\ncluding in §924(c). §1005(a), 98 Stat. 2138. At that time,\\nCongress didn’t provide a separate definition of “crime of\\nviolence” in §924(c) but relied on §16’s general definition.\\nThe two statutes, thus, were originally designed to be read\\ntogether.\\n   Admittedly, things changed a bit over time. Eventually,\\nCongress expanded §924(c)’s predicate offenses to include\\ndrug trafficking crimes as well as crimes of violence.\\n§§104(a)(2)(B)–(C), 100 Stat. 457. When it did so, Con-\\ngress added a subsection-specific definition of “drug traf-\\nficking crime” in §924(c)(2)—and, perhaps thinking that\\nboth terms should be defined in the same place, it also\\nadded a subsection-specific definition of “crime of violence”\\nin §924(c)(3). §104(a)(2)(F), id., at 457. But even then,\\nCongress didn’t write a new definition of that term. In-\\nstead, it copied and pasted the definition from §16 without\\nmaking any material changes to the language of the re-\\nsidual clause. The government suggests that, in doing so,\\nCongress “intentionally separated” and “decoupled” the\\ntwo definitions. Brief for United States 34, 37. But im-\\nporting the residual clause from §16 into §924(c)(3) almost\\nword for word would have been a bizarre way of suggest-\\ning that the two clauses should bear drastically different\\nmeanings. Usually when statutory language “ ‘is obviously\\ntransplanted from . . . other legislation,’ ” we have reason\\nto think “ ‘it brings the old soil with it.’ ” Sekhar v.

S. 729, 733 (2013).\\n   What’s more, when Congress copied §16(b)’s language\\ninto §924(c) in 1986, it proceeded on the premise that the\\nlanguage required a categorical approach. By then courts\\nhad, as the government puts it, “beg[u]n to settle” on the\\nview that §16(b) demanded a categorical analysis. Brief\\nfor United States 36–37. Of particular significance, the\\nSecond Circuit, along with a number of district courts, had\\nrelied on the categorical approach to hold that selling\\ndrugs could never qualify as a crime of violence because\\n“[w]hile the traffic in drugs is often accompanied by vio-\\nlence,” it can also be carried out through consensual sales\\nand thus “does not by its nature involve substantial risk\\nthat physical violence will be used.” United States v. Diaz,\\n778 F. 2d 86, 88 (1985). Congress moved quickly to abro-\\ngate those decisions. But, notably, it didn’t do so by direct-\\ning a case-specific approach or changing the language\\ncourts had read to require the categorical approach. In-\\nstead, it accepted the categorical approach as given and\\nsimply declared that certain drug trafficking crimes auto-\\nmatically trigger §924 penalties, regardless of the risk of\\nviolence that attends them. §§104(a)(2)(B)–(C), 100 Stat.\\n457.\\n   The government’s reply to this development misses the\\nmark. The government argues that §16(b) had not ac-\\nquired such a well-settled judicial construction by 1986\\nthat the reenactment of its language in §924(c)(3)(B)\\nshould be presumed to have incorporated the same con-\\nstruction. We agree. See Jerman v. Carlisle, McNellie,\\nRini, Kramer & Ulrich, L. P. A., 559 U. S. 573, 590 (2010)\\n(interpretations of three courts of appeals “may not have\\n‘settled’ the meaning” of a statute for purposes of the\\nreenactment canon). But Congress in 1986 did more than\\njust reenact language that a handful of courts had inter-\\npreted to require the categorical approach. It amended\\n§924(c) specifically to abrogate the results of those deci-\\n\\x0c16                UNITED STATES v.

And that would\\nhave been an odd way of proceeding if Congress had\\nthought the categorical reading erroneous.\\n   There’s yet one further and distinct way in which\\n§924(c)’s history undermines the government’s case-\\nspecific reading of the residual clause. As originally en-\\nacted in 1968, §924(c) prohibited the use of a firearm in\\nconnection with any federal felony. §102, 82 Stat. 1224.\\nThe 1984 amendments narrowed §924(c) by limiting its\\npredicate offenses to “crimes of violence.” But the case-\\nspecific reading would go a long way toward nullifying\\nthat limitation and restoring the statute’s original\\nbreadth. After all, how many felonies don’t involve a\\nsubstantial risk of physical force when they’re committed\\nusing a firearm—let alone when the defendant brandishes\\nor discharges the firearm?\\n   Recognizing this difficulty, the government assures us\\nthat a jury wouldn’t be allowed to find a felony to be a\\ncrime of violence solely because the defendant used a\\nfirearm, although it could consider the firearm as a “fac-\\ntor.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. But the government identifies no\\ntextual basis for this rule, and exactly how it would work\\nin practice is anyone’s guess. The government says, for\\nexample, that “selling counterfeit handbags” while carry-\\ning a gun wouldn’t be a crime of violence under its ap-\\nproach. Id., at 9. But why not? Because the counterfeit-\\nhandbag trade is so inherently peaceful that there’s no\\nsubstantial risk of a violent confrontation with dissatisfied\\ncustomers, territorial competitors, or dogged police offic-\\ners? And how are jurors supposed to determine that? The\\ndefendant presumably knew the risks of his trade, and he\\nchose to arm himself. See United States v. Simms, 914\\nF. 3d 229, 247–248 (CA4 2019) (en banc) (refusing to\\n“condem[n] jurors to such an ill-defined inquiry”).

Maybe\\nthe case-specific approach doesn’t represent the best read-\\ning of the statute—but, the government insists, it is our\\nduty to adopt any “ ‘fairly possible’ ” reading of a statute to\\nsave it from being held unconstitutional. Brief for United\\nStates 45.6\\n   We doubt, however, the canon could play a proper role\\nin this case even if the government’s reading were “possi-\\nble.” True, when presented with two “fair alternatives,”\\nthis Court has sometimes adopted the narrower construc-\\ntion of a criminal statute to avoid having to hold it uncon-\\nstitutional if it were construed more broadly. United\\nStates v. Rumely, 345 U. S. 41, 45, 47 (1953); see, e.g.,\\nSkilling v. United States, 561 U. S. 358, 405–406, and\\nn. 40 (2010); United States v. Lanier, 520 U. S. 259, 265–\\n267, and n. 6 (1997). But no one before us has identified a\\ncase in which this Court has invoked the canon to expand\\nthe reach of a criminal statute in order to save it. Yet that\\n——————\\n   6 There are at least two different canons of construction that some-\\n\\ntimes go by the name “constitutional avoidance.” The one the govern-\\nment invokes here is perhaps better termed the presumption of consti-\\ntutionality. Of long lineage, it holds that courts should, if possible,\\ninterpret ambiguous statutes to avoid rendering them unconstitutional,\\nsee, e.g., Parsons v. Bedford, 3 Pet. 433, 448–449 (1830) (Story, J.), and\\nit is distinct from the more modern (and more debated) constitutional\\ndoubt canon, which suggests courts should construe ambiguous statutes\\nto avoid the need even to address serious questions about their consti-\\ntutionality, see Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173, 190–191 (1991).\\n\\x0c18                   UNITED STATES v. DAVIS\\n\\n                         Opinion of the Court\\n\\nis exactly what the government seeks here. Its case-\\nspecific reading would cause §924(c)(3)(B)’s penalties to\\napply to conduct they have not previously been understood\\nto reach: categorically nonviolent felonies committed in\\nviolent ways. See Simms, 914 F. 3d, at 256–257 (Wynn,\\nJ., concurring).7\\n   Employing the avoidance canon to expand a criminal\\nstatute’s scope would risk offending the very same due\\nprocess and separation-of-powers principles on which the\\nvagueness doctrine itself rests. See supra, at 4–5. Every-\\none agrees that Mr. Davis and Mr. Glover did many things\\nthat Congress had declared to be crimes; and no matter\\nhow we rule today, they will face substantial prison sen-\\ntences for those offenses. But does §924(c)(3)(B) require\\nthem to suffer additional punishment, on top of everything\\nelse? Even if you think it’s possible to read the statute to\\nimpose such additional punishment, it’s impossible to say\\nthat Congress surely intended that result, or that the law\\ngave Mr. Davis and Mr. Glover fair warning that §924(c)’s\\nmandatory penalties would apply to their conduct. Re-\\nspect for due process and the separation of powers sug-\\ngests a court may not, in order to save Congress the trou-\\n\\n——————\\n  7 The  government claims to have found cases invoking the canon to\\nexpand a statute’s reach, but none actually stands for that proposition.\\nEach simply remarks in passing that a construction the Court arrived\\nat for other reasons had the additional benefit of avoiding vagueness\\nconcerns; none suggests that a narrower construction was available.\\nSee United States v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 176 (1983) (accepting gov-\\nernment’s construction, which was “not contested by appellees”); United\\nStates v. Culbert, 435 U. S. 371, 379 (1978) (finding statute clear and\\nrefusing to “manufacture ambiguity where none exists”); United States\\nv. Shreveport Grain & Elevator Co., 287 U. S. 77, 82–83 (1932) (finding\\nstatute unambiguous and construing it according to “the natural import\\nof its terms”). And the dissent, despite compiling a page-long list of\\nconstitutional avoidance cases spanning “more than 200 years,” post, at\\n25–26, has been unable to find any better examples.

That rule is “perhaps\\nnot much less old than” the task of statutory “construction\\nitself.” United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95 (1820)\\n(Marshall, C. J.). And much like the vagueness doctrine,\\nit is founded on “the tenderness of the law for the rights of\\nindividuals” to fair notice of the law “and on the plain\\nprinciple that the power of punishment is vested in the\\nlegislative, not in the judicial department.” Ibid.; see\\nLanier, 520 U. S., at 265–266, and n. 5. Applying consti-\\ntutional avoidance to narrow a criminal statute, as this\\nCourt has historically done, accords with the rule of lenity.\\nBy contrast, using the avoidance canon instead to adopt a\\nmore expansive reading of a criminal statute would place\\nthese traditionally sympathetic doctrines at war with one\\nanother.8\\n                             IV\\n  What does the dissent have to say about all this? It\\nstarts by emphasizing that §924(c)(3)(B) has been used in\\n“tens of thousands of federal prosecutions” since its en-\\nactment 33 years ago. Post, at 2 (opinion of KAVANAUGH,\\nJ.). And the dissent finds it “surprising” and “extraordi-\\nnary” that, after all those prosecutions over all that time,\\n\\n——————\\n  8 Admittedly,  abandoning the categorical approach in favor of the\\ncase-specific approach would also have the effect of excluding from the\\nstatute’s coverage defendants who commit categorically violent felonies\\nin nonviolent ways, and in that respect would be more “lenient” for\\nsome defendants. Regardless, the constitutional principles underlying\\nthe rule of lenity counsel caution before invoking constitutional avoid-\\nance to construe the statute to punish conduct that it does not unam-\\nbiguously proscribe.\\n\\x0c20                   UNITED STATES v. DAVIS\\n\\n                        Opinion of the Court\\n\\nthe statute could “suddenly” be deemed unconstitutional.\\nPost, at 2–3.       But the government concedes that\\n§924(c)(3)(B) is unconstitutional if it means what everyone\\nhas understood it to mean in nearly all of those prosecu-\\ntions over all those years. So the only way the statute can\\nbe saved is if we were “suddenly” to give it a new meaning\\ndifferent from the one it has borne for the last three dec-\\nades. And if we could do that, it would indeed be “surpris-\\ning” and “extraordinary.”\\n   The dissent defends giving this old law a new meaning\\nby appealing to intuition. It suggests that a categorical\\nreading of §924(c)(3)(B) is “unnatural” because “[i]f you\\nwere to ask John Q. Public whether a particular crime\\nposed a substantial risk of violence, surely he would re-\\nspond, ‘Well, tell me how it went down—what happened?’ ”\\nPost, at 13 (some internal quotation marks omitted).\\nMaybe so. But the language in the statute before us isn’t\\nthe language posited in the dissent’s push poll. Section\\n924(c)(3)(B) doesn’t ask about the risk that “a particular\\ncrime posed” but about the risk that an “offense . . . by its\\nnature, involves.” And a categorical reading of this cate-\\ngorical language seemed anything but “unnatural” to the\\nunanimous Court in Leocal or the plurality in Dimaya.9\\nNor did the government think the categorical reading of\\n§924(c)(3)(B) “unnatural” when it embraced that reading\\nfor decades. The dissent asks us to overlook the govern-\\nment’s prior view, explaining that the government only\\ndefended a categorical reading of the statute “when it did\\nnot matter for constitutional vagueness purposes”—that\\nis, before Johnson and Dimaya identified constitutional\\nproblems with the categorical approach. Post, at 34. But\\n——————\\n  9 To be sure, the dissent suggests that Leocal and Dimaya adopted a\\n\\ncategorical reading simply to avoid practical and constitutional prob-\\nlems. Post, at 15–16, 23, and n. 23. But, as we have seen, this too is\\nmistaken. Leocal did not even mention those problems, and Dimaya\\nheld that the text demanded a categorical approach. See supra, at 9.\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2019)             21\\n\\n                      Opinion of the Court\\n\\nisn’t that exactly the point? Isn’t it at least a little reveal-\\ning that, when the government had no motive to concoct\\nan alternative reading, even it thought the best reading of\\n§924(c)(3)(B) demanded a categorical analysis?\\n   If this line of attack won’t work, the dissent tries another\\nby telling us that we have “not fully account[ed] for the\\nlong tradition of substantial-risk criminal statutes.” Post,\\nat 34. The dissent proceeds to offer a lengthy bill of par-\\nticulars, citing dozens of state and federal laws that do not\\nuse the categorical approach. Post, at 7–10, and nn. 4–17.\\nBut what does this prove? Most of the statutes the dissent\\ncites impose penalties on whoever “creates,” or “engages in\\nconduct that creates,” or acts under “circumstances that\\ncreate” a substantial risk of harm; others employ similar\\nlanguage. Not a single one imposes penalties for commit-\\nting certain acts during “an offense . . . that by its nature,\\ninvolves” a substantial risk, or anything similar. March-\\ning through the dissent’s own catalog thus only winds up\\nconfirming that legislatures know how to write risk-based\\nstatutes that require a case-specific analysis—and that\\n§924(c)(3)(B) is not a statute like that.\\n   When the dissent finally turns to address the words\\nCongress actually wrote in §924(c)(3)(B), its main argu-\\nment seems to be that a categorical reading violates the\\ncanon against superfluity. On this account, reading “of-\\nfense” generically in connection with the residual clause\\nmakes the residual clause “duplicate” the elements clause\\nand leaves it with “virtually nothing” to do. Post, at 20.\\nBut that is a surprising assertion coming from the dissent,\\nwhich devotes several pages to describing the “many”\\noffenders who have been convicted under the residual\\nclause using the categorical approach but who “might not”\\nbe prosecutable under the elements clause. Post, at 30–33.\\nIt is also wrong. As this Court has long understood, the\\nresidual clause, read categorically, “sweeps more broadly”\\nthan the elements clause—potentially reaching offenses,\\n\\x0c22                    UNITED STATES v. DAVIS\\n\\n                          Opinion of the Court\\n\\nlike burglary, that do not have violence as an element but\\nthat arguably create a substantial risk of violence. Leocal,\\n543 U. S., at 10. So even under the categorical reading,\\nthe residual clause is far from superfluous.\\n   Without its misplaced reliance on the superfluity canon,\\nthere is little left of the dissent’s textual analysis. The\\ndissent asserts that the phrase “by its nature” must\\n“focu[s] on the defendant’s actual conduct”—but only\\nbecause this “follows” from the dissent’s earlier (and mis-\\ntaken) superfluity argument. Post, at 21. Next, the dis-\\nsent claims that “the word ‘involves’ ” and “the phrase ‘in\\nthe course of committing the offense’ ” both support a case-\\nspecific approach. Post, at 22. But these words do not\\nfavor either reading: It is just as natural to ask whether\\nthe offense of robbery ordinarily “involves” a substantial\\nrisk that violence will be used “in the course of committing\\nthe offense” as it is to ask whether a particular robbery\\n“involved” a substantial risk that violence would be used\\n“in the course of committing the offense.” If anything, the\\nstatute’s use of the present and not the past tense lends\\nfurther support to the categorical reading.10 The dissent\\nthinks it significant, too, that the statute before us “does\\nnot use the term ‘conviction,’ ” post, at 23; but that word is\\nhardly a prerequisite for the categorical approach, as\\nDimaya makes clear. Remarkably, the dissent has noth-\\n——————\\n  10 The dissent claims that Taylor v. United States, 495 U. S. 575\\n\\n(1990), and Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U. S. 29 (2009), pointed to “the\\nabsence of the word ‘involved’ ” as one reason to adopt a categorical\\napproach. Post, at 22. Not true. Taylor explained that the ACCA’s\\nelements clause requires a categorical approach in part because it\\nrefers to a crime “that ‘has as an element’—not any crime that, in a\\nparticular case, involves—the use or threat of force.” 495 U. S., at 600.\\nAll the work in that sentence was being done by the phrase “in a\\nparticular case,” not by the word “involves.” And Nijhawan noted that\\nthe Court had construed the ACCA’s residual clause, which refers to\\ncrimes “that ‘involv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of\\nphysical injury,” to require the categorical approach. 557 U.

And when it comes to the constitutional\\navoidance canon, the dissent does not even try to explain\\nhow using that canon to criminalize conduct that isn’t\\ncriminal under the fairest reading of a statute might be\\nreconciled with traditional principles of fair notice and\\nseparation of powers. Instead, the dissent seems willing\\nto consign “ ‘thousands’ ” of defendants to prison for\\n“years—potentially decades,” not because it is certain or\\neven likely that Congress ordained those penalties, but\\nbecause it is merely “possible” Congress might have done\\nso.

Post, at 34. In fact, the dissent’s\\nlegal analysis only comes sandwiched between a lengthy\\npaean to laws that impose severe punishments for gun\\ncrimes and a rogue’s gallery of offenses that may now be\\npunished somewhat less severely. See post, at 1–2, 30–34.\\nThe dissent acknowledges that “the consequences cannot\\nchange our understanding of the law.” Post, at 34. But\\nwhat’s the point of all this talk of “bad” consequences if\\nnot to suggest that judges should be tempted into reading\\nthe law to satisfy their policy goals? Even taken on their\\nown terms, too, the dissent’s policy concerns are consider-\\nably overblown. While the dissent worries that our ruling\\nmay elicit challenges to past §924(c) convictions, post, at\\n33, the dissent’s preferred approach—saving §924(c)(3)(B)\\nby changing its meaning—would also call into question\\ncountless convictions premised on the categorical reading.\\nAnd defendants whose §924(c) convictions are overturned\\nby virtue of today’s ruling will not even necessarily receive\\nlighter sentences: As this Court has noted, when a defend-\\n\\x0c24                UNITED STATES v.

Dean v. United States, 581 U. S. ___, ___\\n(2017) (slip op., at 5).\\n  Of course, too, Congress always remains free to adopt a\\ncase-specific approach to defining crimes of violence for\\npurposes of §924(c)(3)(B) going forward. As Mr. Davis and\\nMr. Glover point out, one easy way of achieving that goal\\nwould be to amend the statute so it covers any felony that,\\n“based on the facts underlying the offense, involved a\\nsubstantial risk” that physical force against the person or\\nproperty of another would be used in the course of commit-\\nting the offense.

That law made it a separate\\nfederal crime to use or carry a firearm during a federal\\nfelony. Despite that and other efforts, violent crime with\\nfirearms continued at extraordinarily dangerous levels. In\\n1984 and again in 1986, in legislation signed by President\\nReagan, Congress reenacted that provision of the 1968\\nAct, with amendments.

Mean-\\nwhile, violent crime with firearms has decreased signifi-\\ncantly. Over the last 25 years, the annual rate of murders\\nwith firearms has dropped by about 50 percent, and the\\nannual rate of nonfatal violent crimes (robberies, aggra-\\nvated assaults, and sex crimes) with firearms has de-\\ncreased by about 75 percent. Violent crime in general\\n(committed with or without a firearm) has also declined.\\nDuring that same time period, both the annual rate of\\noverall violent crime and the annual rate of murders have\\ndropped by almost 50 percent.\\n  Although the level of violent crime in America is still\\nvery high, especially in certain cities, Americans under the\\nage of 40 probably cannot fully appreciate how much safer\\nmost American cities and towns are now than they were in\\nthe 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Many factors have contrib-\\nuted to the decline of violent crime in America. But one\\ncannot dismiss the effects of state and federal laws that\\nimpose steep punishments on those who commit violent\\ncrimes with firearms.\\n  Yet today, after 33 years and tens of thousands of federal\\nprosecutions, the Court suddenly finds a key provision of\\n§924(c) to be unconstitutional because it is supposedly too\\nvague. That is a surprising conclusion for the Court to\\nreach about a federal law that has been applied so often\\nfor so long with so little problem. The Court’s decision\\ntoday will make it harder to prosecute violent gun crimes\\nin the future. The Court’s decision also will likely mean\\nthat thousands of inmates who committed violent gun\\ncrimes will be released far earlier than Congress specified\\nwhen enacting §924(c).

Davis and\\nGlover’s crime spree ended with still more dangerous\\nbehavior: a high-speed car chase in wet and dangerous\\ndriving conditions that culminated in a crash.\\n  Section 924(c)(3) lays out the definition of “crime of\\nviolence” for purposes of §924(c). That definition has two\\nprongs, either of which can bring a defendant within the\\nscope of §924(c).3\\n  The first prong of §924(c)(3) is the elements prong. That\\nprong, the Government concedes here, asks whether the\\nunderlying crime categorically fits within §924(c) because\\nof the elements of the crime. The judge makes that de-\\ntermination. If the answer is yes, then the judge instructs\\nthe jury on the §924(c) offense to simply find whether the\\ndefendant used or carried a firearm during and in relation\\nto that underlying crime, or possessed a firearm in fur-\\ntherance of that underlying crime.\\n  The Fifth Circuit concluded that Davis and Glover’s\\nconspiracy offenses did not fit within the elements prong\\nof §924(c)(3). So the question was whether Davis and\\nGlover were covered by the second prong.\\n  The second prong of §924(c)(3) is the substantial-risk\\nprong. That prong covers cases beyond those covered by\\nthe first prong, the elements prong. Congress sensibly\\nwanted to cover defendants who committed crimes that\\nare not necessarily violent by definition under the ele-\\nments prong, but who committed crimes with firearms in a\\n——————\\n   3 Section 924(c)(3) provides: “For purposes of this subsection the term\\n\\n‘crime of violence’ means an offense that is a felony and—(A) has as an\\nelement the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\\nagainst the person or property of another, or (B) that by its nature,\\ninvolves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or\\nproperty of another may be used in the course of committing the\\noffense.”\\n\\x0c6                  UNITED STATES v. DAVIS\\n\\n                   KAVANAUGH, J., dissenting\\n\\nway that created a substantial risk that violent force\\nwould be used. To that end, the substantial-risk prong,\\nproperly read, focuses not on the elements of the underly-\\ning crime, but rather on the defendant’s conduct during\\nthat crime. If a defendant used or carried a firearm dur-\\ning and in relation to the crime, and the defendant’s con-\\nduct during the crime created a substantial risk that\\nphysical force may be used, then the defendant may be\\nguilty of a §924(c) offense. In that instance, the jury\\nmakes the finding: Did the defendant’s conduct during the\\nunderlying crime create a substantial risk that violent\\nforce would be used?\\n   In other words, as relevant here, a defendant can fall\\nwithin the scope of §924(c) either (1) because of the ele-\\nments of the underlying crime or (2) because of the de-\\nfendant’s conduct in committing the underlying crime.\\nEither (1) the judge finds that an element of the underly-\\ning crime entails the use of physical force or (2) the jury\\nfinds that the defendant’s actual conduct involved a sub-\\nstantial risk that physical force may be used. Put another\\nway, the underlying crime itself may automatically bring\\nthe defendant within the scope of §924(c). Or if the under-\\nlying crime does not automatically qualify as a crime of\\nviolence, then the defendant’s conduct during the crime\\nmay still bring the defendant within the scope of §924(c).\\nSensible enough.\\n   The basic question in this case is whether the substantial-\\nrisk prong of §924(c)(3)’s definition of “crime of violence” is\\nunconstitutionally vague. It is not.\\n   As this Court has explained multiple times, criminal\\nlaws that apply a risk standard to a defendant’s conduct\\nare not too vague, but instead are perfectly constitutional.\\nWriting for the Court in Johnson, for example, Justice\\nScalia stated that “we do not doubt the constitutionality of\\nlaws that call for the application of a qualitative standard\\nsuch as ‘substantial risk’ to real-world conduct.” 576\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 588 U.

In New York, reckless endangerment\\noccurs when a person “recklessly engages in conduct which\\ncreates a substantial risk of serious physical injury to\\nanother person.” N. Y.

And in Maryland, neglect of a minor is defined as\\n“the intentional failure to provide necessary assistance\\nand resources for the physical needs or mental health of a\\nminor that creates a substantial risk of harm to the mi-\\nnor’s physical health or a substantial risk of mental injury\\nto the minor.” Md.

To reiterate,\\n§924(c)(3)(B) defines “crime of violence” as “an offense that\\nis a felony and . . . that by its nature, involves a substan-\\ntial risk that physical force against the person or property\\nof another may be used in the course of committing the\\noffense.” Section 924(c)(3)(B) affords people of ordinary\\nintelligence ample notice that they may be punished if\\nthey carry or use a gun while engaging in criminal conduct\\nthat presents a risk that physical force may be used.\\nThere “is a whole range of conduct that anyone with at\\nleast a semblance of common sense would know” is cov-\\nered by §924(c)(3)(B). Chicago v. Morales, 527 U. S. 41,\\n114 (1999) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (internal quotation\\nmarks omitted). And prosecutors, defense attorneys,\\njudges, and juries are well equipped to enforce and defend\\n§924(c)(3)(B) prosecutions in a principled and predictable\\nway—just as they have for decades with many other\\nsubstantial-risk criminal statutes. As Judge Niemeyer\\nwrote in his separate opinion in the Fourth Circuit, “the\\nparties in those cases had little difficulty understanding,\\nenforcing, or defending the §924(c)(1) charges at issue.”\\nUnited States v.

In other\\nwords, the Court says that a defendant’s guilt or innocence\\nunder §924(c)(3)’s substantial-risk prong hinges on a\\njudge’s assessment of how a hypothetical defendant would\\nordinarily commit the underlying crime. In the Court’s\\nview, a defendant’s guilt or innocence under §924(c)(3)’s\\nsubstantial-risk prong does not depend on a jury’s finding\\nabout how the actual defendant actually committed the\\nunderlying crime.\\n   The Court’s second step is based on the Court’s deci-\\nsions in Johnson and Dimaya. The Court says that the\\nordinary-case categorical approach makes §924(c)(3)(B)\\nunconstitutionally vague.\\n   For purposes of this case, the Court’s error is its first\\nstep—that is, in construing the substantial-risk prong of\\n§924(c)(3) to require an ordinary-case categorical ap-\\nproach. For three reasons, I disagree with the Court’s\\nanalysis. First, the Court’s justifications in Johnson and\\nDimaya for adopting the categorical approach do not apply\\nin the context of §924(c). Second, the text of §924(c)(3)(B)\\nis best read to focus on the actual defendant’s actual con-\\nduct during the underlying crime, not on a hypothetical\\ndefendant’s imagined conduct during an ordinary case of\\nthe underlying crime. Third, even if the text were ambig-\\nuous, the constitutional avoidance canon requires that we\\ninterpret the statute to focus on the actual defendant’s\\nactual conduct.\\n   I will address those three points in Parts II–A, II–B, and\\nII–C.\\n                              A\\n     According to the Court, if §924(c)(3)(B) focused on the\\n\\x0c                   Cite as: 588 U.

But §924(c)(3)(B),\\nas the Court reads it, focuses on a hypothetical defend-\\nant’s conduct during an ordinary case of the underlying\\ncrime. As a result, the Court says that §924(c)(3)(B) is\\nunconstitutionally vague.\\n  But it makes little sense, as I see it, to say that\\n§924(c)(3)(B)’s substantial-risk inquiry focuses on whether\\na hypothetical defendant’s imagined conduct during an\\nordinary case of the crime creates a substantial risk that\\nphysical force may be used, rather than on whether the\\nactual defendant’s actual conduct during the actual crime\\ncreated a substantial risk that physical force may be used.\\nWhy would we interpret a federal law that criminalizes\\ncurrent-offense conduct to focus on a hypothetical defend-\\nant rather than on the actual defendant? As Judge New-\\nsom cogently wrote for the Eleventh Circuit en banc ma-\\njority, “If you were to ask John Q. Public whether a\\nparticular crime posed a substantial risk of violence,\\nsurely he would respond, ‘Well, tell me how it went\\ndown—what happened?’ ” Ovalles, 905 F. 3d, at 1241.19\\n  Why does the Court read the substantial-risk prong in\\nsuch an unnatural way? The Court explains that Johnson\\ninterpreted similar substantial-risk language to require\\nthe ordinary-case categorical approach. See 576 U. S., at\\n___–___ (slip op., at 12–13). A plurality of the Court did\\nthe same in Dimaya. See 584 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at\\n12–15). And the Court today casts this case as the third\\ninstallment in a trilogy with a predictable ending, one that\\nwas supposedly foreordained by Johnson and Dimaya.\\n  The gaping hole in the Court’s analysis, in my view, is\\nthat Johnson and Dimaya addressed statutes that im-\\n——————\\n  19 Judge Newsom’s majority opinion was joined by Chief Judge Ed\\n\\nCarnes and Judges Tjoflat, Marcus, William Pryor, Rosenbaum,\\nBranch, and Hull.\\n\\x0c14                    UNITED STATES v.

See §16 (de-\\nfining “crime of violence”); 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(F) (in-\\ncorporating 18 U. S. C. §16); 8 U. S. C. §1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)\\n(deportation); §§1229b(a)(3), (b)(1)(C) (ineligibility for\\ncancellation of removal and adjustment of status).\\n   In interpreting those statutes, the Court employed the\\nordinary-case categorical approach to assess an individual’s\\npast convictions. And application of that categorical ap-\\nproach, the Court then said, rendered the statutes at issue\\nin those cases unconstitutionally vague. See Dimaya, 584\\nU. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 9–11); Johnson, 576 U. S., at\\n___–___ (slip op., at 5–6).20\\n   Two important principles drove the Court’s adoption of\\nthe categorical approach in the prior-conviction context in\\nJohnson and Dimaya.\\n   First, in the prior-conviction cases, the Court empha-\\nsized that the categorical approach avoids the difficulties\\nand inequities of relitigating “past convictions in minitri-\\nals conducted long after the fact.” Moncrieffe v. Holder,\\n569 U. S. 184, 200–201 (2013). Without the categorical\\napproach, courts would have to determine the underlying\\n——————\\n  20 Tellingly, the Government in Johnson and Dimaya did not dispute\\n\\nthat the categorical approach was the proper method of interpreting the\\nstatutes at issue. See Sessions v. Dimaya, 584 U. S. ___, ___ (2018)\\n(plurality opinion) (slip op., at 13); Johnson v. United States, 576 U. S.\\n___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 13). In this case, the Government strenu-\\nously disputes the applicability of the categorical approach precisely\\nbecause the inquiry is not about past convictions.\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 588 U.

United\\nStates, 495 U. S. 575, 601–602 (1990). The factual state-\\nments that are contained in those documents are often\\n“prone to error.” Mathis v. United States, 579 U. S. ___,\\n___ (2016) (slip op., at 10). The categorical approach\\navoids the unfairness of allowing inaccuracies to “come\\nback to haunt the defendant many years down the road.”\\nId., at ___ (slip op., at 11). The Court has echoed that\\nreasoning time and again. See, e.g., Dimaya, 584 U. S., at\\n___ (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 15); Johnson, 576 U. S.,\\nat ___ (slip op., at 13); Descamps v. United States, 570\\nU. S. 254, 270 (2013); Chambers v. United States, 555\\nU. S. 122, 125 (2009).\\n  Second, in the prior-conviction cases, the Court insisted\\non the categorical approach to avoid “Sixth Amendment\\nconcerns.” Descamps, 570 U. S., at 269. The Sixth\\nAmendment, as interpreted by this Court’s precedents,\\ndoes not allow a judge (rather than a jury) to make factual\\ndeterminations that increase the maximum penalty. See\\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000). The\\nCourt has read its Sixth Amendment precedents to require\\nthe categorical approach. Under the categorical approach,\\nthe judge looks only to the fact of conviction and the statu-\\ntory definition of the prior offense. The Court has reiterated\\nthose Sixth Amendment concerns in countless categorical-\\napproach cases. See, e.g., Dimaya, 584 U. S., at ___\\n(plurality opinion) (slip op., at 13); Mathis, 579 U. S., at\\n___ (slip op., at 10); Shepard v. United States, 544 U. S. 13,\\n24–25 (2005) (plurality opinion); Taylor, 495 U. S., at 601.\\n  In short, the Court in Johnson and Dimaya employed\\nsomething akin to the constitutional avoidance doctrine to\\nread the statutes at issue to avoid practical and Sixth\\nAmendment problems. In the words of JUSTICE THOMAS,\\nthe “categorical approach was never really about the best\\nreading of the text.” Dimaya, 584 U. S., at ___ (dissenting\\n\\x0c16                 UNITED STATES v. DAVIS\\n\\n                   KAVANAUGH, J., dissenting\\n\\nopinion) (slip op., at 28). As Judge Raggi has perceptively\\nstated: “[C]onstitutional avoidance informed the original\\ncategorical-approach mandate.” United States v. Barrett,\\n903 F. 3d 166, 179 (CA2 2018).\\n   But neither of the two reasons identified in Johnson and\\nDimaya applies to 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(3)(B)—not even a\\nlittle.\\n   First, §924(c) does not require examination of old con-\\nduct underlying a prior conviction. Section 924(c) operates\\nentirely in the present. In a §924(c) prosecution, there are\\nordinarily two charged crimes: the underlying crime and\\nthe §924(c) offense. Here, for example, the defendants\\nwere charged with conspiracy to commit robbery and with\\nthe §924(c) offense. The defendant’s conduct during the\\nunderlying crime is part of the §924(c) offense. The con-\\nduct charged in the §924(c) offense is in front of the jury (if\\nthe case goes to trial) or accepted by the defendant in the\\nplea agreement (if the defendant pleads guilty). The\\nindictment must allege specific offense conduct, and that\\nconduct must be proved with real-world facts in order to\\nobtain a conviction. There is no need to worry about stale\\nevidence or unavailable witnesses. Nor is there any need\\nto worry about inaccuracies in years-old or decades-old\\ndocuments coming back to haunt the defendant.\\n   Second, §924(c) likewise raises no Sixth Amendment\\nconcerns. A jury will find the facts or, if the case ends in a\\nguilty plea, the defendant will accept the facts in the plea\\nagreement. For the §924(c) charge, as relevant here, a\\njury must find that the defendant’s conduct “by its nature,\\ninvolves a substantial risk that physical force against the\\nperson or property of another may be used in the course of\\ncommitting the offense.” The defendant has the oppor-\\ntunity to contest the relevant facts either at the trial or in\\nplea negotiations. No Sixth Amendment issue arises in a\\n§924(c) prosecution.\\n   No practical or Sixth Amendment problems exist with\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2019)          17\\n\\n                  KAVANAUGH, J., dissenting\\n\\n§924(c)(3)(B). Indeed, the Court itself acknowledges that\\n“a case-specific approach wouldn’t yield the same practical\\nand Sixth Amendment complications” that arose in John-\\nson and Dimaya. Ante, at 8.\\n   We should recognize that Johnson and Dimaya dealt\\nwith an entirely different context: prior convictions. There\\nis no need to follow Johnson and Dimaya off the cliff here.\\nWe should read §924(c)(3)(B) like the dozens of other\\nsubstantial-risk statutes in federal and state criminal law:\\nto focus on the actual defendant’s actual conduct during\\nthe actual underlying crime, not on a hypothetical defend-\\nant’s imagined conduct during an ordinary case of that\\ncrime.\\n                             B\\n  Now to the statutory text of §924(c)(3)(B). Even though\\nthe context here is current-offense conduct, not past con-\\nvictions, the Court says that the statutory language none-\\ntheless compels a focus on a hypothetical defendant’s\\nimagined conduct, not on the actual defendant’s actual\\nconduct. I disagree. Criminal defendants are usually\\npunished based on what they actually did, not based on\\nwhat a hypothetical defendant might have done.\\n  To begin with, the text of §924(c)(3)(B) must be inter-\\npreted against the backdrop of traditional criminal-law\\npractice. As described above, substantial-risk statutes are\\ncommonplace in federal and state criminal law. Those\\nstatutes ordinarily call for examination of the actual de-\\nfendant’s actual conduct during the actual crime. The\\nCourt does not identify a single self-contained federal or\\nstate law that defines the actus reus of the crime based on\\nthe imagination of the judge about a hypothetical defend-\\nant, rather than on the evidence before the jury about the\\nactual defendant.\\n  This Court applied an exception in Johnson and Dimaya\\nfor substantial-risk statutes that impose sentencing and\\n\\x0c18                UNITED STATES v. DAVIS\\n\\n                   KAVANAUGH, J., dissenting\\n\\nother penalties based on past convictions. But that is an\\nexception for past convictions, not a rule for current-\\noffense conduct. Section 924(c)(3)(B) must be read in line\\nwith the traditional, common practice of focusing on the\\nactual defendant’s actual conduct during the underlying\\ncrime.\\n  With that background, I turn to the precise text of\\n§924(c)(3). To repeat, the text of §924(c)(3) provides: A\\ndefendant may not use or carry a firearm during and in\\nrelation to, or possess a firearm in furtherance of, “an\\noffense that is a felony and” that either (A) “has as an\\nelement the use, attempted use, or threatened use of\\nphysical force against the person or property of another,”\\nor (B) “by its nature, involves a substantial risk that phys-\\nical force against the person or property of another may be\\nused in the course of committing the offense.”\\n  I will focus on four particular aspects of the statutory\\ntext of §924(c)(3)(B).\\n  First, start with the term “offense.” Section 924(c)(3)\\nhas two prongs under which a defendant might qualify for\\na §924(c) conviction: first, if the underlying crime auto-\\nmatically qualifies as a crime of violence based on its\\nelements; and, second, if the defendant’s conduct during\\nthe underlying crime created a substantial risk that phys-\\nical force may be used, even if the underlying crime by its\\nelements does not constitute a crime of violence.\\n  The term “offense” applies to both prongs. In the ele-\\nments prong, the term refers to the elements of the under-\\nlying crime. In the substantial-risk prong, the term refers\\nto the defendant’s conduct during the underlying crime.\\nThat is entirely commonplace and sensible.\\n  Reading “offense” in that commonsense way follows\\nfrom the Court’s precedents interpreting the term “of-\\nfense.” As the Court has explained many times, the term\\n“offense” may “sometimes refer to a generic crime” and\\nmay “sometimes refer to the specific acts in which an\\n\\x0c                     Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2019)                    19\\n\\n                       KAVANAUGH, J., dissenting\\n\\noffender engaged on a specific occasion.” Nijhawan v.\\nHolder, 557 U. S. 29, 33–34 (2009).21 Indeed, the single\\nterm “offense” can refer to both in the same statutory\\nscheme. See, e.g., id., at 40; id., at 38 (listing other exam-\\nples); United States v. Hayes, 555 U. S. 415, 421–422\\n(2009).\\n  In United States v. Hayes, for example, the Court inter-\\npreted the term “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.”\\nThat term was defined as “an offense” that (1) “has, as an\\nelement, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the\\nthreatened use of a deadly weapon,” and (2) was “commit-\\nted by” a person who has a particular relationship with\\nthe victim. §921(a)(33)(A). The Court interpreted the\\n“offense that . . . has, as an element” language in that\\nprovision to focus on the legal prohibition, and interpreted\\nthe “offense . . . committed by” language to focus on the\\ndefendant’s conduct. See Hayes, 555 U. S., at 421–422. In\\nother words, the term “offense” was used once but had two\\ndifferent meanings as applied to the two different parts of\\nthe statutory provision.\\n  Another example is the Immigration and Nationality\\nAct. That statute defines “aggravated felony” in part as\\n“an offense” (1) that “involves fraud or deceit” and (2) “in\\nwhich the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.” 8\\nU. S. C. §1101(a)(43)(M)(i). The Court interpreted the\\n“offense that . . . involves fraud or deceit” language to\\nfocus on the legal prohibition. See Kawashima v. Holder,\\n565 U. S. 478, 483 (2012). And the Court interpreted the\\n“offense . . . in which the loss” language to focus on the\\nindividual’s conduct. See Nijhawan, 557 U. S., at 40.\\nAgain, the term “offense” was used once, but had two\\n——————\\n  21 More generally, this Court has often said that “identical language\\n\\nmay convey varying content” in the same statute, based on context.\\nYates v. United States, 574 U. S. 528, 537 (2015) (plurality opinion); see\\nalso Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573 U. S. 302, 319–320\\n(2014).\\n\\x0c20                    UNITED STATES v. DAVIS\\n\\n                       KAVANAUGH, J., dissenting\\n\\ndifferent meanings as applied to the two different parts of\\nthe statutory provision.\\n   Section 924(c)(3) is the same kind of statutory provision.\\nIt likewise encompasses both the legal prohibition (in\\nsubpart (A)) and the defendant’s actual conduct (in sub-\\npart (B)). The term “offense” was read in Hayes, Ka-\\nwashima, and Nijhawan to encompass both the legal\\nprohibition and the defendant’s conduct. The term should\\nbe read that same way here.\\n   Moreover, if the substantial-risk prong of §924(c)(3)\\nrequires assessing a hypothetical defendant’s conduct\\nrather than the actual defendant’s conduct, then there\\nwould be little daylight between the elements prong and\\nthe substantial-risk prong. After all, a crime is defined by\\nits elements. The elements tell you what happens in an\\nordinary case of a crime. To imagine how a hypothetical\\ndefendant would have committed an ordinary case of the\\ncrime, you would presumably look back to the elements of\\nthe crime. But doing that under the substantial-risk\\nprong—as the Court would do—would just duplicate the\\ninquiry that already occurs under the elements prong.\\nThat would defeat Congress’ purpose in adding the\\nsubstantial-risk prong to §924(c)(3)—namely, covering\\ndefendants who committed crimes that are not violent by\\ndefinition but that are committed by particular defendants\\nin ways that create a risk of violence. There is no reason\\nto think that Congress meant to duplicate the elements\\nprong in the substantial-risk prong.22\\n   The Court usually tries to avoid an interpretation of a\\nstatutory provision that would make the provision redun-\\ndant and accomplish virtually nothing. See, e.g., Republic\\n\\n——————\\n  22 Thisduplication point is icing on a textual cake already frosted. In\\nother words, our interpretation of the term “offense” is informed by the\\ntext and by our precedents. Our interpretation stands with or without\\nthe duplication argument.\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 588 U.

We should heed that principle here, and\\nrecognize that the term “offense” in the substantial-risk\\nprong refers to the actual defendant’s conduct during the\\nunderlying crime.\\n   In short, the term “offense” in §924(c)(3), as applied to\\nthe substantial-risk prong, focuses on the actual defend-\\nant’s actual conduct, not on a hypothetical defendant’s\\nimagined conduct.\\n   Second, §924(c)(3)(B) asks whether the defendant’s\\noffense “by its nature” involves a risk that physical force\\nmay be used. In a vacuum, the “nature” of an offense\\ncould be either “the metaphysical ‘nature’ of the offense” or\\n“the underlying facts of the offense.” Dimaya, 584 U. S.,\\nat ___ (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 24). But that is\\nbecause the term “offense” could refer to a legal prohibi-\\ntion or to the defendant’s actual conduct. As explained\\nabove, however, the term “offense” as applied to the\\nsubstantial-risk prong refers to the actual defendant’s con-\\nduct during the underlying crime. It follows that “by its na-\\nture” focuses on the nature of the actual defendant’s con-\\nduct during the crime. The phrase “by its nature” is\\nlinked to the term “offense.” If the term “offense” refers to\\nthe defendant’s actual conduct, then “by its nature” also\\nfocuses on the defendant’s actual conduct.\\n   Under the conduct-specific approach to the substantial-\\nrisk prong, the “by its nature” language simply means that\\nthe Government has to show more than a defendant’s\\nproclivity for crime and more than the mere fact that the\\ndefendant was carrying a gun. The Government has to\\n\\x0c22                UNITED STATES v. DAVIS\\n\\n                   KAVANAUGH, J., dissenting\\n\\nshow that the defendant’s conduct by its nature during the\\ncrime created a substantial risk that physical force may be\\nused.\\n   In short, as JUSTICE THOMAS has pointed out, it “is\\nentirely natural to use words like ‘nature’ and ‘offense’ to\\nrefer to an offender’s actual underlying conduct.” Ibid. So\\nit is here.\\n   Third, §924(c)(3)(B) asks whether the defendant’s con-\\nduct “involves” a substantial risk that physical force may\\nbe used. In Taylor v. United States, a case involving a\\nprior-conviction statutory provision, the Court pointed to\\nthe absence of the word “involved” in adopting a categori-\\ncal approach. 495 U. S., at 600. And in Nijhawan v.\\nHolder, another case involving a prior-conviction statutory\\nprovision, the Court explained that the word “involves” did\\nnot support a categorical approach. 557 U. S., at 36.\\nHere, unlike in Taylor, the statute does use the word\\n“involves.” Under Taylor’s reasoning, the inclusion of the\\nword “involves” in §924(c)(3)(B) supports the conclusion\\nthat §924(c)(3)(B) employs a conduct-specific approach\\nrather than a categorical approach.\\n   Fourth, §924(c)(3)(B)’s use of the phrase “in the course of\\ncommitting the offense” indicates that the proper focus is\\non the actual defendant’s actual conduct, not on a hypo-\\nthetical defendant’s imagined conduct. After all, the\\nunderlying offense was committed by the actual defend-\\nant, not by a hypothetical defendant. It strains common\\nsense to think that the “in the course of committing the\\noffense” language in §924(c)(3)(B) contemplates an inquiry\\ninto a hypothetical defendant’s conduct during an ordinary\\ncase of the crime.\\n   Importantly, the law at issue in Johnson did not have\\nthe “in the course of committing the offense” language.\\n§924(e)(2)(B)(ii). That is a major textual difference be-\\ntween the law in Johnson on the one hand and\\n§924(c)(3)(B) on the other hand. And that textual distinc-\\n\\x0c                     Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2019)                  23\\n\\n                      KAVANAUGH, J., dissenting\\n\\ntion further shows that §924(c)(3)(B) focuses on the actual\\ndefendant’s actual conduct.\\n   In short, those four textual indicators, while not all\\nentirely one-sided, together strongly suggest that\\n§924(c)(3)(B) focuses on the actual defendant’s actual\\nconduct during the actual crime, not on a hypothetical\\ndefendant’s imagined conduct during an ordinary case of\\nthe crime.\\n   On top of all the language in the statute, §924(c)(3)(B)\\ndoes not contain the critical term that ordinarily marks a\\ncategorical approach.\\n   Section 924(c)(3)(B) does not use the term “conviction.”\\nThis Court has historically recognized the term “convic-\\ntion” as a key textual driver of the categorical approach.\\nIn cases such as Taylor and Johnson, the Court zeroed in\\non the word “convictions.” See Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___\\n(slip op., at 13); Taylor, 495 U. S., at 600; see also Mathis,\\n579 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9); Moncrieffe, 569 U. S., at\\n191; Ovalles, 905 F. 3d, at 1245. So too, the Court in\\nLeocal v. Ashcroft emphasized that the text of the INA\\nthat incorporated §16(b) used the term “convicted.” 543\\nU. S. 1, 4, 7 (2004).23\\n   The term “conviction” is nowhere to be found in the text\\nof §924(c)(3)(B). That should not come as a surprise, given\\nthat §924(c)(3)(B) is a substantive criminal offense con-\\ncerned with the defendant’s current-offense conduct. The\\nabsence of the term “conviction” in §924(c)(3)(B) strongly\\n\\n——————\\n  23 In Leocal, the Court interpreted §16(b) to require a categorical\\n\\napproach. But unlike §924(c)(3)(B), that statutory provision applied in\\nthe context of past convictions. See 8 U. S. C. §§1101(a)(43)(F),\\n1227(a)(2)(A)(iii); Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, §217(a), 98 Stat.\\n2021; Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, §1202, 98 Stat. 2151.\\nTo be sure, §16(b) was once incorporated into §924(c). But in 1986,\\nCongress severed the two provisions and included a standalone “crime\\nof violence” definition in §924(c). For those two reasons, §924(c)(3)(B)\\nneed not and should not be interpreted in the same way as §16(b).\\n\\x0c24                UNITED STATES v. DAVIS\\n\\n                   KAVANAUGH, J., dissenting\\n\\nsupports a conduct-specific approach.\\n   Put simply, the textual clues—both the words that are\\nused and the words that are not used—point strongly to\\nthe conclusion that §924(c)(3)(B) requires a jury to assess\\nthe actual defendant’s actual conduct during the underly-\\ning crime. The conclusion becomes overwhelming when\\nconsidered against the general background of substantial-\\nrisk statutes. To be sure, a statute can always be written\\nmore clearly. But here, the textual toolkit leads decisively\\nto that conclusion.\\n                              C\\n  But after all of that, suppose that you are not convinced.\\nSuppose that you think that this case is still a close call on\\nthe text, even with the background of substantial-risk\\nstatutes and the Court’s precedents. Indeed, suppose you\\nultimately disagree with the above analysis of the text.\\nEven so, the Government still wins—unless it can be said\\nthat §924(c)(3)(B) unambiguously requires a categorical\\napproach. Under the constitutional avoidance canon, the\\nprecise question before us is not whether §924(c)(3)(B)\\nis best read to require a conduct-specific approach, but\\nrather (as the Court’s cases say) whether §924(c)(3)(B) can\\nreasonably, plausibly, or fairly possibly be interpreted to\\nrequire a conduct-specific approach. The answer to that\\nquestion is easy. Yes. See Hooper v. California, 155 U. S.\\n648, 657 (1895) (“reasonable”); Clark v. Martinez, 543\\nU. S. 371, 380 (2005) (“plausible”); Skilling v. United\\nStates, 561 U. S. 358, 406 (2010) (“fairly possible” (internal\\nquotation marks omitted)).\\n  The Court says that if §924(c)(3)(B) requires the categor-\\nical approach, then it is unconstitutionally vague. But the\\nCourt also says that if §924(c)(3)(B) focuses on the defend-\\nant’s actual conduct, then it is constitutionally permissi-\\nble. As the Court puts it, “a case-specific approach would\\navoid the vagueness problems that doomed the statutes in\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 588 U.

So the entire ball game\\nis whether it is fairly possible to interpret §924(c)(3)(B) to\\nrequire a conduct-specific approach. It surely is at least\\nfairly possible.\\n   It is an elementary principle of statutory interpretation\\nthat an ambiguous statute must be interpreted, whenever\\npossible, to avoid unconstitutionality. See generally Scalia,\\nReading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts, at 247–\\n251; Eskridge, Interpreting Law: A Primer on How to\\nRead Statutes and the Constitution, at 317–322. That\\nuncontroversial principle of statutory interpretation dates\\nback to the Founding era. See Mossman v. Higginson, 4\\nDall. 12, 14 (1800). As JUSTICE THOMAS has explained,\\nthe traditional doctrine of constitutional avoidance com-\\nmands “courts, when faced with two plausible construc-\\ntions of a statute—one constitutional and the other uncon-\\nstitutional—to choose the constitutional reading.” Clark,\\n543 U. S., at 395 (dissenting opinion). This Court’s duty is\\n“not to destroy the Act if we can, but to construe it, if\\nconsistent with the will of Congress, so as to comport with\\nconstitutional limitations.” Civil Service Comm’n v. Letter\\nCarriers, 413 U. S. 548, 571 (1973). In discharging that\\nduty, “every reasonable construction must be resorted to,\\nin order to save a statute from unconstitutionality.”\\nHooper, 155 U. S., at 657.\\n   This Court’s longstanding practice of saving ambiguous\\nstatutes from unconstitutionality where fairly possible\\naffords proper respect for the representative branches of\\nour Government.

There is a debate about the\\nformer practice. There is no real debate about the latter\\nrule. And it is the latter rule of statutory interpretation at\\nissue here.\\n  Section 924(c)(3)(B) is best read to focus on the defend-\\nant’s actual conduct. But at a minimum—given the text,\\nthe background of substantial-risk laws, and the relevant\\nprecedents—it is fairly possible to interpret §924(c)(3)(B)\\nto focus on the defendant’s actual conduct. Because that\\nreasonable interpretation would save §924(c)(3)(B) from\\nunconstitutionality, this case should be very straightfor-\\nward, as Judge Newsom explained in his thorough majority\\nopinion in the Eleventh Circuit and as Judge Niemeyer\\nand Judge Richardson explained in their persuasive sepa-\\nrate opinions in the Fourth Circuit. Ovalles, 905 F. 3d, at\\n1251; Simms, 914 F. 3d, at 272 (opinion of Niemeyer, J.);\\nid., at 272–277 (opinion of Richardson, J.). We should\\nprefer the constitutional reading over the unconstitutional\\nreading.\\n  The Court did not apply constitutional avoidance in\\nJohnson and Dimaya. Why not? In those two cases, the\\nCourt explained, the canon of constitutional avoidance was\\nessentially rendered a nullity. That is because, as the\\nCourt described the situation, the Court was between a\\nrock and a hard place. The categorical approach would\\nhave led to Fifth Amendment vagueness concerns, whereas\\napplying the conduct-specific approach would have led to\\nSixth Amendment jury-trial concerns. See Dimaya, 584\\nU. S., at ___–___ (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 13–14).\\n  Here, by contrast, the Court is not between a rock and a\\nhard place.      Applying the categorical approach to\\n§924(c)(3)(B) would lead to vagueness concerns, whereas\\napplying the conduct-specific approach would lead to no\\nconstitutional concerns.\\n  Faced with a choice between a rock and constitutionality,\\n\\x0c28                UNITED STATES v. DAVIS\\n\\n                   KAVANAUGH, J., dissenting\\n\\nthe Court chooses the rock. I do not understand that\\nchoice.\\n   The Court offers two related reasons for its choice to run\\nthe statute into a rock. Neither reason holds up.\\n   First, the Court concludes that the constitutional avoid-\\nance canon must yield to the rule of lenity. That argu-\\nment disregards the Court’s oft-repeated statements that\\nthe rule of lenity is a tool of last resort that applies “only\\nwhen, after consulting traditional canons of statutory\\nconstruction,” grievous ambiguity remains. Hayes, 555\\nU. S., at 429 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also,\\ne.g., Ocasio v. United States, 578 U. S. ___, ___, n. 8 (2016)\\n(slip op., at 13, n. 8) (“after seizing everything from which\\naid can be derived” (internal quotation marks omitted));\\nMuscarello v. United States, 524 U. S. 125, 138 (1998)\\n(same); United States v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 499 (1997)\\n(same); Reno v. Koray, 515 U. S. 50, 65 (1995) (same);\\nUnited States v. Shabani, 513 U. S. 10, 17 (1994) (“after\\nconsulting traditional canons of statutory construction”);\\nSmith v. United States, 508 U. S. 223, 239 (1993) (“after\\nseizing every thing from which aid can be derived” (inter-\\nnal quotation marks and alterations omitted)); Moskal v.\\nUnited States, 498 U. S. 103, 108 (1990) (“after resort to\\nthe language and structure, legislative history, and moti-\\nvating policies of the statute” (internal quotation marks\\nomitted)); Callanan v. United States, 364 U. S. 587, 596\\n(1961) (“at the end of the process of construing what Con-\\ngress has expressed”).\\n   The constitutional avoidance canon is a traditional\\ncanon of statutory interpretation. The constitutional\\navoidance canon is employed to reach a reasonable inter-\\npretation of an ambiguous statute. Where, as here, that\\ncanon applies and yields such a reasonable interpretation,\\nno grievous ambiguity remains. The rule of lenity has no\\nrole to play. Contrary to the Court’s assertion, the canon\\nof constitutional avoidance is not “at war” with the rule of\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2019)           29\\n\\n                   KAVANAUGH, J., dissenting\\n\\nlenity. Ante, at 19. The canon of constitutional avoidance\\nprecedes the rule of lenity because the rule of lenity comes\\ninto play (this Court has said countless times) only “after\\nconsulting traditional canons of statutory construction.”\\nHayes, 555 U. S., at 429 (emphasis added; internal quota-\\ntion marks omitted). The rule of lenity “comes into opera-\\ntion at the end of the process of construing what Congress\\nhas expressed, not at the beginning as an overriding con-\\nsideration of being lenient to wrongdoers.” Callanan, 364\\nU. S., at 596.\\n   In addition, the rule of lenity is triggered only in the\\nface of “grievous ambiguity.” Muscarello, 524 U. S., at 139\\n(internal quotation marks omitted).            To reiterate,\\n§924(c)(3)(B) is best read to focus on the actual defendant’s\\nactual conduct. But to the extent that there is any ambi-\\nguity in §924(c)(3)(B), that ambiguity is far from grievous.\\n   Second, and relatedly, the Court claims that the canon\\nof constitutional avoidance, as a general matter, cannot be\\nrelied upon to broaden the scope of a criminal statute, as\\nopposed to narrowing the scope of a criminal statute. And\\nthe Court says that the canon cannot be used here be-\\ncause, in the Court’s view, relying on the constitutional\\navoidance canon in this case would expand the scope of\\n§924(c)(3)(B). I disagree for two independent reasons.\\n   To begin with, that theory seems to come out of no-\\nwhere. The Court’s novel cabining of the constitutional\\navoidance canon is not reflected in this Court’s precedents.\\nOn the contrary, it contradicts several precedents. This\\nCourt has applied the constitutional avoidance canon even\\nwhen avoiding the constitutional problems would have\\nbroadened the statute’s scope. For example, in United\\nStates v. Culbert, this Court rejected a narrowing con-\\nstruction of the Hobbs Act because that construction\\nwould have raised vagueness concerns. 435 U. S. 371, 374\\n(1978); see also United States v. Shreveport Grain & Ele-\\nvator Co., 287 U. S. 77, 82 (1932); cf. United States v.\\n\\x0c30               UNITED STATES v. DAVIS\\n\\n                  KAVANAUGH, J., dissenting\\n\\nGrace, 461 U. S. 171, 176 (1983).\\n   Moreover, the premise of this novel broadening/\\nnarrowing theory is flawed. A categorical approach to\\n§924(c)(3)(B) would not be inherently narrower than a\\nconduct-specific approach. Each approach would sweep in\\nsome crimes that the other would not. On the one hand,\\nsome crimes that might be deemed categorically violent\\nsometimes may be committed in nonviolent ways. Those\\ncrimes would be covered by the categorical approach but\\nnot by a conduct-specific approach. On the other hand,\\nsome categorically nonviolent crimes are committed in\\nviolent ways. Those crimes would not be covered by the\\ncategorical approach but would be covered by a conduct-\\nspecific approach. See Johnson, 576 U. S., at ___ (ALITO,\\nJ., dissenting) (slip op., at 12).\\n   In sum, the constitutional avoidance canon makes this\\nan especially straightforward case. It is at least fairly\\npossible to read §924(c)(3)(B) to focus on the actual de-\\nfendant’s actual conduct during the actual crime. End of\\ncase.\\n                             III\\n  The consequences of the Court’s decision today will be\\nsevere. By invalidating the substantial-risk prong of\\n§924(c)(3), the Court’s decision will thwart Congress’ law\\nenforcement policies, destabilize the criminal justice sys-\\ntem, and undermine safety in American communities. If\\nthe law required those results, we would have to swallow\\nthe consequences. But the law, in my respectful view,\\ndoes no such thing.\\n  The Court’s decision means that people who in the\\nfuture commit violent crimes with firearms may be able to\\nescape conviction under §924(c). In enacting §924(c),\\nCongress sought to keep firearms away from violent crim-\\ninal situations. Today, the Court invalidates a critical\\nprovision designed to achieve that goal.

When defendants use\\nfirearms during conspiracies to commit robbery, arsons,\\nattempted carjackings, and kidnapings, to name just a\\nfew, they might no longer be subject to prosecution under\\n§924(c). See, e.g., Simms, 914 F. 3d, at 233–234 (conspiracy\\nto commit robbery); United States v. Salas, 889 F. 3d 681,\\n683–684 (CA10 2018) (arson); United States v.

They then attempted\\n     to carjack a third vehicle. They approached a family\\n     getting out of a minivan and demanded the keys. One\\n     of the defendant’s co-conspirators hit a 13-year-old\\n     girl in the mouth with a baseball bat. Another shot\\n     an AK–47 at the girl’s family.

They also shot and killed one of\\n     their victims point blank. See Barrett, 903 F. 3d, at\\n     170, 184.\\n   Those real-life stories highlight a second unfortunate\\nconsequence of the Court’s decision. Many offenders who\\nhave already committed violent crimes with firearms—\\nand who have already been convicted under §924(c)—may\\nbe released early from prison. The Court’s decision will\\napply to all defendants whose convictions are not yet final\\non direct review and who preserved the argument. With\\nthe benefit of this Court’s decision, many dangerous of-\\nfenders who received lengthy prison sentences as a result\\nof their violent conduct might walk out of prison early.\\nAnd who knows whether the ruling will be retroactive?\\nCourts will be inundated with collateral-review petitions\\nfrom some of the most dangerous federal offenders in\\nAmerica. As Judge Niemeyer wrote in his separate opin-\\nion in the Fourth Circuit, “thousands of §924(c)(1) convic-\\ntions will unnecessarily be challenged as premised on\\nwhat the majority today concludes is an unconstitutionally\\nvague provision, even though the parties in those cases\\nhad little difficulty understanding, enforcing, or defending\\nthe §924(c)(1) charges at issue.” Simms, 914 F. 3d, at 264.\\n   Moreover, defendants who successfully challenge their\\n§924(c) convictions will not merely be resentenced. Ra-\\nther, their §924(c) convictions will be thrown out altogether.\\nThat is because, to restate an obvious point, §924(c) de-\\nfines a substantive criminal offense. To be sure, the\\n§924(c) defendants may also be serving other sentences for\\nother convictions (for instance, if they were convicted of\\nand sentenced for the underlying crime of violence). But\\nwith the benefit of the Court’s decision, they may be able\\nto get their §924(c) convictions tossed and lop off years—\\n\\x0c34                UNITED STATES v. DAVIS\\n\\n                   KAVANAUGH, J., dissenting\\n\\npotentially decades—from their total prison time.\\n   All because the Court thinks that §924(c)(3)(B) unam-\\nbiguously compels a focus on the imagined conduct of a\\nhypothetical defendant rather than on the actual conduct\\nof the actual defendant. That analysis is not persuasive,\\nespecially in light of the constitutional avoidance doctrine.\\nIt is true that the Government once advocated for a cate-\\ngorical approach. But in the early years after Congress\\nadded a “crime of violence” definition to §924(c), before\\ncourts settled on a categorical approach, the Government\\ncorrectly argued for a conduct-specific approach to the\\nsubstantial-risk prong. See, e.g., United States v. Cruz,\\n805 F. 2d 1464, 1469 (CA11 1986). The Government later\\nchanged its tune only after the courts settled on a categor-\\nical approach—at a time when it did not matter for consti-\\ntutional vagueness purposes, before Johnson and Dimaya.\\nIn any event, the question is what to do now after Johnson\\nand Dimaya. The answer should not be hard. To quote\\nJudge William Pryor, writing for five judges in the Elev-\\nenth Circuit, how “did we ever reach the point where” we\\n“must debate whether a carjacking in which an assailant\\nstruck a 13-year-old girl in the mouth with a baseball bat\\nand a cohort fired an AK–47 at her family is a crime of\\nviolence? It’s nuts.” Ovalles, 905 F. 3d, at 1253 (concur-\\nring opinion).\\n   To be sure, the consequences cannot change our under-\\nstanding of the law. But when the consequences are this\\nbad, it is useful to double-check the work. And double-\\nchecking here, in my view, reveals several problems:\\nrelying on cases from the prior-conviction context whose\\nrationales do not apply in this current-offense context; not\\nfully accounting for the long tradition of substantial-risk\\ncriminal statutes; not reading the words of the statute in\\ncontext and consistent with precedents such as Hayes; and\\nthen, perhaps most problematically, misapplying the\\nlongstanding constitutional avoidance canon.

In\\nrelevant part, that statute specifies a minimum prison\\nterm of fifteen years (and a maximum term of life) for\\na felon-in-possession who has three previous con-\\nvictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses “com-\\nmitted on occasions different from one another.”\\n§ 924(e)(1). Burglary qualifies as a violent crime for pur-\\nposes of the ACCA. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The government\\ncontended that Elliott’s convictions for three burglaries\\nhe committed over a period of five days in 1998\\nrendered him subject to the enhanced penalty specified\\nby the ACCA. Without that enhancement, he would\\notherwise have been subject to a maximum prison term\\nof 10 years. § 924(a)(2).\\n  Elliott, although he did not contest the fact of his\\nprior convictions, nonetheless opposed the enhancement.\\nAs relevant here, he contended that whether the three\\nburglaries were committed on occasions different from\\none another constituted a factual question as to which\\nthe Fifth and Sixth Amendments, and the Supreme\\nCourt’s decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466,\\n120 S. Ct. 2348 (2000), entitled him to a jury trial. Second,\\nElliott argued that because the three burglaries took\\nplace over a period of several days during what he re-\\ngarded as a single criminal episode, the court should\\nfind that they were not committed on occasions\\n\\x0c4                                                No. 11-2766\\n\\ndifferent from one another, and that consequently he\\nwas not subject to the enhanced penalty.1\\n  The district court rejected both arguments in a\\nwritten opinion. United States v. Elliott, 2011 WL 3273466\\n(N.D. Ind. Aug. 1, 2011). The court invoked Almendarez-\\nTorres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 118 S. Ct. 1219 (1998),\\nas its authority to make determinations regarding\\nElliott’s criminal history. 2011 WL 3273466, at *4; see also\\nR. 18-2 at 20-22. And, looking to our en banc decision\\nin Hudspeth, the court found that the three 1998 burglaries\\nwere committed on occasions different from one an-\\nother. 2011 WL 3273466, at *2-*3. The court emphasized\\nthat the burglaries were committed sequentially rather\\nthan simultaneously, and that significantly more time\\nhad passed between the burglaries than was the case in\\nHudspeth, affording Elliott the opportunity after each\\nburglary to cease his criminal conduct. Id., at *3. The\\ncourt added at sentencing: “[C]learly when somebody\\ncommits three burglaries over the course of five days,\\nunder the way the Seventh Circuit and for that\\nmatter, every other circuit it appears, has interpreted\\n[section] 924[(e)], those would all be qualifying convic-\\ntions.” R. 18-2 at 19.\\n\\n\\n1\\n   Elliott also argued below that the bright-line approach to\\nthe different-occasions inquiry that we adopted in Hudspeth\\nrenders the enhanced penalties imposed by the ACCA\\nirrational and excessive, in violation of the Eighth Amend-\\nment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishments. The district\\ncourt rejected that contention, and Elliott does not renew the\\nargument here.\\n\\x0cNo. 11-2766                                              5\\n\\n  The court proceeded to sentence Elliott to the minimum\\nterm of 180 months specified by the ACCA. That term\\nwas eight months below the low end of the sentencing\\nrange recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines.\\n\\n\\n                            II.\\n  Elliott renews his challenge to the armed career\\ncriminal enhancement on appeal. As a threshold matter,\\nhe contends that whether the three burglaries for which\\nhe previously had been convicted occurred on occasions\\ndifferent from one another was a fact-intensive issue\\nthat he was entitled to have a jury resolve. He acknowl-\\nedges that under Almendarez-Torres, the district judge\\nis authorized to make certain findings regarding a de-\\nfendant’s criminal history, but contends that whether\\nhis prior crimes occurred on occasions different from\\none another represents a distinct type of inquiry that\\nAlmendarez-Torres does not authorize the judge to make.\\nAs to the substance of the ACCA inquiry, Elliott urges\\nthis court to overrule its en banc decision in Hudspeth,\\na step that he believes would pave the way to recogni-\\ntion that the three burglaries he committed in 1998\\nwere indivisible components of a single, multi-day\\ncrime spree and thus were not committed on occasions\\ndifferent from one another. Both arguments present\\nquestions of law that we review de novo. Kirkland v.\\nUnited States, 687 F.3d 878, 882-83 (7th Cir. 2012); United\\nStates v. Trennell, 290 F.3d 881, 889 (7th Cir. 2002).\\n  As to the first issue, the district judge was empowered\\nto determine whether Elliott committed the burglaries\\n\\x0c6                                                   No. 11-2766\\n\\non occasions different from one another. The Supreme\\nCourt in Almendarez-Torres held that a defendant’s recidi-\\nvism is not an element of the offense which must be\\nfound by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, but rather is\\na sentencing factor that may be found by the sentencing\\njudge, even when recidivism increases the statutory\\nmaximum penalty to which the defendant is exposed.\\n523 U.S. at 239, 243-46, 118 S. Ct. at 1228-29, 1230-32.\\nAlmendarez-Torres has remained good law even as the\\nCourt in later decisions has recognized a defendant’s\\nright to a jury finding on other factors that expose the\\ndefendant to a longer sentence. See Jones v. United States,\\n526 U.S. 227, 119 S. Ct. 1215 (1999); Apprendi v. New Jersey,\\nsupra, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S. Ct. 2348; Blakely v. Washington,\\n542 U.S. 296, 124 S.

Indeed, each of these cases has\\nexpressly cited the fact of a prior conviction as an excep-\\ntion to the rule it stated. Jones, 526 U.S. at 243 n.6, 119 S. Ct.\\nat 1224 n.6; Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S. Ct. at 2362-63;\\nBlakely, 542 U.S. at 301, 124 S. Ct. at 2536; Booker, 543\\nU.S. at 244, 125 S. Ct. at 756; O’Brien, 130 S. Ct. at 2174.2\\n\\n\\n2\\n  This is not to say that the future of Almendarez-Torres is\\nsecure. Justice Thomas’s concurrence in Shepard v. United States\\nremarked that “Almendarez-Torres . . . has been eroded by this\\nCourt’s subsequent Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, and a\\nmajority of the Court now recognizes that Almendarez-Torres\\nwas wrongly decided.” 544 U.S. 13, 27, 125 S. Ct. 1254, 1264\\n(2005) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in the\\njudgment). We ourselves have observed:\\n                                                  (continued...)\\n\\x0cNo. 11-2766                                                        7\\n\\n  Elliott has a point when he stresses that whether a\\ndefendant’s prior crimes occurred on occasions\\ndifferent from one another is a question that looks\\nbeyond “the fact of a prior conviction,” see Blakely, 542\\nU.S. at 301, 124 S. Ct. at 2536 (quoting Apprendi), and for\\nthat matter beyond the elements essential to that convic-\\ntion, see Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 599, 602, 110\\nS. Ct. 2143, 2158, 2160 (1990); see also Nijhawan v. Holder,\\n557 U.S. 29, 33-36, 129 S.

The\\nfacts that inform the determination of whether prior\\ncrimes occurred on different occasions—including the\\ntimes and dates, places, and victims of those crimes—\\nusually do not constitute essential elements of a convic-\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n    (...continued)\\n       Almendarez-Torres is vulnerable to being overruled not\\n       because of Shepard but because of United States v. Booker, 543\\n       U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738 (2005). Booker holds that there is a\\n       right to a jury trial and to the reasonable-doubt standard\\n       in a sentencing proceeding (that is, the Sixth Amendment\\n       is applicable) if the judge’s findings dictate an increase\\n       in the maximum penalty. Id. at 756. Findings made under\\n       the Armed Career Criminal Act do that. So if logic rules,\\n       those findings too are subject to the Sixth Amendment. . . .\\nUnited States v. Browning, 436 F.3d 780, 782 (7th Cir. 2006).\\nWe added, however, that “the continued authority of\\nAlmendarez-Torres is not for us to decide.” Id.\\n\\x0c8                                                No. 11-2766\\n\\ntion. See, e.g., United States v. Cina, 699 F.2d 853, 859 (7th\\nCir. 1983) (“An ‘essential’ or ‘material’ element of the\\ncrime is one whose specification with precise accuracy\\nis necessary to establish the very illegality of the behavior\\nand thus the court’s jurisdiction. Only in rare cases is time\\na material element of the offense charged, even where\\ncontinuing offenses such as conspiracy are alleged.”)\\n(citation omitted); United States v. Muhammad, 928\\nF.2d 1461, 1470 (7th Cir. 1991) (“[T]he location where\\nthe offense took place is not an ‘essential’ or ‘material’\\nelement of the crime as that term was defined in Cina.”);\\ncf. United States v. Alhalabi, 443 F.3d 605, 613 (7th Cir.\\n2006) (payment amounts referenced in food stamp\\nfraud charges were not material elements of the offense).\\nOn the other hand, because facts of this nature serve\\nto define the scope of a crime, provide notice to the defen-\\ndant of what precisely he is charged with doing so that\\nhe can prepare a defense, and protect him against\\ndouble jeopardy, see United States v. Castaldi, 547 F.3d\\n699, 703 (7th Cir. 2008); United States v. Blanchard, 542\\nF.3d 1133, 1140 (7th Cir. 2008); United States v. Andrus, 775\\nF.2d 825, 843-44 (7th Cir. 1985); United States v. Horton, 676\\nF.2d 1165, 1169 (7th Cir. 1982), they are closely inter-\\nwoven with the essential elements of an offense. We\\nrecently observed that “in rejecting arguments after\\nApprendi that the separate occasions determination falls\\noutside the Almendarez-Torres exception, we and other\\ncircuits have gone to great lengths to explain that the\\nfacts related to whether prior convictions occurred on\\ndifferent occasions cannot be easily distinguished from\\nthe facts related to the existence of the prior convic-\\n\\x0cNo. 11-2766                                                   9\\n\\ntions.” Kirkland v. United States, supra, 687 F.3d at 890 (coll.\\ncases). Moreover, facts such as these, although they are\\nnot normally essential elements of a conviction, will\\nfrequently, if not usually, be disclosed in charging docu-\\nments, plea agreements, findings of fact resulting from\\na bench trial, and other materials that the Supreme\\nCourt described as “conclusive records made or used in\\nadjudicating guilt.” Shepard v. United States, supra, 544\\nU.S. at 21, 125 S. Ct. at 1260. Our decision in Kirkland\\nemphasizes that a court’s inquiry as to the different-\\noccasions prong of the ACCA is limited to such docu-\\nments. 687 F.3d at 888-89.\\n  Consequently, this court, like our sister circuits, has\\nconstrued Almendarez-Torres to permit a district court to\\nmake a finding for purposes of the ACCA as to whether\\na defendant committed three or more violent felonies\\nor serious drug offenses on occasions different from\\none another. United States v. Hendrix, 509 F.3d 362, 375-76\\n(7th Cir. 2007); United States v. Morris, 293 F.3d 1010, 1012-\\n13 (7th Cir. 2002); United States v. Skidmore, 254 F.3d\\n635, 642 (7th Cir. 2001) (coll. cases from other circuits).\\nIndeed, our decisions have explicitly rejected the very\\nargument that Elliot makes here—namely, that deter-\\nmining the relationship of a defendant’s prior crimes to\\none another is beyond the scope of the finding that\\nAlmendarez-Torres permits a judge to make. See Hendrix,\\n509 F.3d at 375-76 (citing United States v. Schlifer, 403 F.3d\\n849, 852 (7th Cir. 2005) (determination whether de-\\nfendant’s prior crimes were unrelated, for purposes of\\nU.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, is not beyond scope of inquiry judge\\nmay make under Almendarez-Torres)); Morris, 293 F.3d\\nat 1012-13. As we observed in Morris:\\n\\x0c10                                              No. 11-2766\\n\\n     The Almendarez-Torres Court even cited § 924(e) of\\n     the ACCA as one of many examples for the proposi-\\n     tion that “prior commission of a serious crime—is as\\n     typical a sentencing factor as one might imagine.”\\n     523 U.S. at 230, 118 S. Ct. 1219. Moreover, the recidi-\\n     vism enhancement at issue in Almendarez–Torres\\n     also limited the convictions that could be consid-\\n     ered—to include only aggravated felonies. Morris\\n     has failed to articulate a reasoned basis for distin-\\n     guishing the factor at issue here from other factors\\n     traditionally considered in enhancing a sentence\\n     based on recidivism.\\n293 F.3d at 1012-13. Thus, unless and until the Supreme\\nCourt overrules Almendarez-Torres or confines its holding\\nsolely to the fact of a prior conviction, as opposed to the\\nnature and/or sequence of a defendant’s prior crimes,\\na district judge properly may make the findings\\nrequired by the ACCA.\\n  Hudspeth supplies the answer to the second question\\npresented by Elliott’s appeal—whether the three\\nburglaries he committed in 1998 occurred on\\noccasions different from one another. Our discussion of\\nthe different-occasions inquiry in Hudspeth began with\\nthe recognition of widespread agreement among the\\ncircuit courts that a defendant will be subject to the\\nACCA enhancement “if each of [his] prior convictions\\narose out of a ‘separate and distinct criminal episode.’ ” 42\\nF.3d at 1019 (quoting United States v. Schieman, 894 F.2d\\n909, 911 (7th Cir. 1990) (emphasis in Hudspeth) & coll.\\ncases). Factors relevant to that assessment include the\\nnature of the crimes, the identities of the victims, and the\\n\\x0cNo. 11-2766                                               11\\n\\nlocations where the crimes took place. Id. We also recog-\\nnized that the timing is a relevant consideration, but to\\na limited extent: crimes that occur simultaneously will\\nbe deemed to have occurred on a single occasion; but\\nthe passage of even a small amount of time between\\ncrimes—10 minutes in Schieman—may well suffice to\\nseparate them for purposes of the ACCA. Id. at 1919-20.\\nWhat really matters, we emphasized, is the opportunity\\nof the perpetrator to terminate his wrongdoing. Id.\\nat 1020. Thus, even when a defendant has committed\\na multi-crime spree over a short period of time, each\\noffense comprising the spree will be considered to have\\noccurred on a separate occasion so long as the defendant\\nat each step had the opportunity to stop and proceed\\nno further. Id. (citing United States v. Brady, 988 F.2d 664,\\n668-69 (6th Cir. 1993) (en banc)). When a defendant com-\\nmits multiple crimes simultaneously—as when he robs\\nmore than one person at the same time, or commits\\nessentially one act that violates multiple criminal stat-\\nutes—there is no dividing point between the offenses\\nthat affords him the chance to desist from further\\ncriminal activity. See id. at 1020, 1021. “In contrast, a\\ndefendant who commits sequential crimes has the oppor-\\ntunity at each and every turn to withdraw from his crimi-\\nnal activity.” Id. at 1021. Therefore, we concluded, a\\ncourt’s inquiry as to the timing of the prior offenses\\n“is simple: were the crimes simultaneous or were they\\nsequential?” Id. at 1021 (emphasis in original).\\n  Having adopted that bright-line rule, our assessment\\nof the prior crimes at issue in Hudspeth was straightfor-\\nward. The defendant and his accomplices had committed\\na series of three burglaries over a period of 36 minutes\\n\\x0c12                                                  No. 11-2766\\n\\nagainst three adjoining businesses in a strip mall: they\\nhad first pried open the door of a dry cleaners, then\\nused a sledgehammer to break through a wall separating\\nthe cleaners from the donut shop next door, and from\\nthere forced open a door connecting the donut shop\\nwith an insurance company; along the way, they ran-\\nsacked all three businesses. Because the defendant had\\nburglarized the three businesses in sequence rather than\\nsimultaneously, we deemed the burglaries to have oc-\\ncurred on different occasions for purposes of the ACCA:\\n     Entry into each successive business reflected a clear\\n     and deliberate choice to commit a “distinct aggres-\\n     sion,” [United States v.] Godinez, 998 F.2d [471] at\\n     473 [(7th Cir. 1993)]. At any given point in time\\n     during his crime spree, Hudspeth was free to cease\\n     and desist from further criminal activity. He\\n     instead chose to continue. Because of his three deci-\\n     sions to enter each successive business, it is evident\\n     that he intended “to engage in a separate criminal\\n     episode.” [United States v.] Tisdale, 921 F.2d [1095] at\\n     1099 [10th Cir. 1990)]; see also Godinez, 998 F.2d at 472\\n     (“one crime hard on the heels of another can be a\\n     ‘separate and distinct criminal episode,’ as Schieman\\n     itself shows.”).\\n42 F.3d at 1022.3\\n\\n\\n3\\n  Our understanding of the facts surrounding the burglaries\\nat issue in Hudspeth rested to a significant extent on the\\npolice reports regarding those burglaries. See 42 F.3d at 1018 &\\nn.3. The Supreme Court’s subsequent decision in Shepard\\n                                                   (continued...)\\n\\x0cNo. 11-2766                                                13\\n\\n  Hudspeth’s result and rationale leave no question that\\nElliott’s three prior burglaries likewise occurred on dif-\\nferent occasions. The burglaries involved different\\nvictims and different homes, and they took place sequen-\\ntially rather than simultaneously. Elliott, like Hudspeth,\\nthus had an opportunity after each burglary to con-\\ntemplate what he was doing and abandon his course\\nof criminal conduct. Indeed, Elliott’s burglaries took\\nplace over the course of five days—and one or more\\ndays apart from one another—rather than over the\\ncourse of 36 minutes, as was the case in Hudspeth.\\nElliott thus had far more of an opportunity to change\\ncourse and desist from wrongdoing than did Hudspeth.\\nSee, e.g., United States v. Nigg, 667 F.3d 929, 936 (7th Cir.)\\n(three armed robberies committed over six days consti-\\ntuted separate criminal episodes under Hudspeth), cert.\\ndenied, 132 S. Ct. 2704 (2012); United States v. Hunter, 418\\nF. App’x 490, 493-94 (7th Cir. 2011) (non-precedential\\ndecision) (recognizing that it would be frivolous to\\ncontend that robberies of five different victims in dif-\\nferent locations on same day constituted a single\\ncriminal episode, notwithstanding fact that they all\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n   (...continued)\\ndisapproved reliance on such extra-judicial records in\\nassessing the nature of a defendant’s prior convictions. 544\\nU.S. at 26, 125 S. Ct. at 1263. To the extent Hudspeth deemed\\nit proper to resort to such documents in evaluating the rela-\\ntionship of a defendant’s prior crimes to one another,\\nour decision on that point is no longer good law, as we recog-\\nnized in Kirkland, 687 F.3d at 886-87 & n.9.\\n\\x0c14                                               No. 11-2766\\n\\nstemmed from same bank robbery, as robberies were\\ncommitted sequentially rather than simultaneously);\\nUnited States v.

App’x 506, 508-\\n10 (7th Cir. 2007) (non-precedential decision) (two rob-\\nberies of different businesses on same day con-\\nstituted separate offenses under Hudspeth); United States\\nv. Morris, supra, 293 F.3d at 1014 (under Hudspeth and\\nother precedents, two shootings on same night,\\n“although close in time and location, involved distinct\\ncriminal aggressions from which [defendant] had an\\nopportunity to cease and withdraw”); United States v.\\nCardenas, 217 F.3d 491, 492 (7th Cir. 2000) (three sales\\nof crack cocaine to informants over two days, with\\ntwo sales taking place only 45 minutes and half a block\\napart, amounted to distinct criminal episodes under\\nHudspeth); United States v.

Overruling a precedent obviously “is not a step\\n\\x0cNo. 11-2766                                              15\\n\\nwe take lightly,” NewPage Wis. Sys. Inc. v. United Steel\\nWorkers Int’l Union, 651 F.3d 775, 779 (7th Cir. 2011), and\\noverruling an en banc decision is something that only\\nthe full court could do, United States v. Carpenter, 406\\nF.3d 915, 916 (7th Cir. 2005). Moreover, we typically\\nreserve reexamination of a precedent for a case in which\\nabandoning that precedent would make a difference.\\nE.g., Loomis v. Exelon Corp., 658 F.3d 667, 675 (7th Cir.\\n2011). Here, as the district court implied when it observed\\nthat Elliott’s prior burglaries would meet the ACCA’s\\ndifferent-occasions test under the law of this or any\\nother circuit, even setting aside Hudspeth, Elliott\\nis unlikely to prevail in his contention that his prior\\nburglaries constituted a single rather than multiple crimes.\\n  The rationale of the dissents in Hudspeth is illuminating\\nin this regard. Both dissents were critical of the bright-\\nline rule distinguishing simultaneous crimes from sequen-\\ntial ones. 42 F.3d at 1026-27 (Flaum, J., concurring in\\npart and dissenting in part); id. at 1035, 1037 (Ripple, J.,\\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). Both argued\\nfor a less rigid approach that would allow more\\npragmatic judgments in examining a set of prior crimes\\nto determine whether they should be treated as sepa-\\nrate or distinct criminal episodes. Judge Flaum sug-\\ngested that “a nuanced, fact-based approach better\\nresolves how many occasions are encompassed within a\\nparticular course of conduct.” Id. at 1027. Judge Ripple\\nobserved that the court’s adoption of a bright-line test\\nconstituted a departure from its prior decisions in this\\narea, which “ha[d] reflected a thoughtful and measured\\napproach to the task required by the statute—identifying\\n\\x0c16                                              No. 11-2766\\n\\nthose criminals whose repetitive behavior requires a\\nspecial degree of isolation from society.” Id. at 1035; see\\nalso id. at 1037. He argued that “[f]actors of time and\\ndistance must be evaluated in terms of the legislative\\nintent in order to identify and segregate the true recidi-\\nvist.” Id. at 1036. Looking at the facts in Hudspeth\\nthrough that lens, Judge Ripple concluded that the\\nseries of three burglaries should be treated as a single\\nepisode:\\n     In a very short period of time, Mr. Hudspeth and his\\n     accomplices, with a sledgehammer and other tools,\\n     broke into three adjoining businesses in one location\\n     and ransacked them. Their arrival with such tools\\n     designed to expedite the penetration of the walls\\n     between the adjacent businesses reflects a clear plan\\n     for the group to work together to break through\\n     from one business to another. This venture did not\\n     comprise “distinct aggressions,” [Godinez, 998 F.2d\\n     at 473], but rather a singular, continuous course\\n     of conduct that depended on the spatial proximity of\\n     these stores. . . .\\nId. Judge Flaum agreed:\\n     I view the fact that Hudspeth and his partners\\n     entered several attached but separate stores at sequen-\\n     tial addresses, as opposed to, for example, several\\n     departments of a single larger store, to be a mere\\n     fortuity in these circumstances.\\nId. at 1027.\\n  It is worth pointing out that neither dissent signaled\\nany disagreement with the holdings of pre-Hudspeth\\n\\x0cNo. 11-2766                                               17\\n\\ndecisions like Schieman and Godinez, which were given\\nsignificant attention in the majority decision in Hudspeth\\nand which treated crimes committed within a very\\nshort time of one another as separate episodes for\\npurposes of the ACCA. See Schieman, 894 F.2d 909 (defen-\\ndant assaulted police officer who approached him\\nto question him about burglary he had committed some\\nfive to 10 minutes earlier and three blocks away); Godinez,\\n998 F.2d 471 (defendant kidnapped woman in order to\\nuse her car in robbery, which he committed slightly\\nmore than one hour after the kidnapping). Judge Ripple’s\\ndissent, in fact, recognized that the sort of recidivism\\nthat Congress meant to punish more severely when it\\nenacted the ACCA “can be manifest in relatively short\\ntime frames and in situations not far removed from\\neach other,” and his dissent cited many cases to that\\neffect. 42 F.3d at 1035 & n.20.\\n  Instead, the dissenters believed that the majority’s error\\nin Hudspeth lay in emphasizing the sequential nature of\\na defendant’s criminal acts to the exclusion of other\\ncircumstances suggesting that those acts ought to be\\ntreated as part of a single criminal episode. Illustratively,\\nJudge Ripple pointed out that under the majority’s\\nsimultaneous-versus-sequential test, a defendant who\\nenters a dwelling and shoots multiple people simulta-\\nneously with one burst of automatic weapons fire\\ncommits a single aggression, but if he then walks into\\nanother room to shoot another person, he commits a\\nsecond, distinct aggression. Id. at 1037. Judge Flaum\\nsimilarly noted that the majority’s way at looking\\nat sequencing attributed artificial importance to\\n\\x0c18                                                 No. 11-2766\\n\\nfortuitous circumstances: thus, in Hudspeth, the sequen-\\ntial burglaries of adjoining but separate businesses\\nwere treated as distinct criminal episodes, whereas\\nan unlawful entry into a single business, and the\\nensuing break-in into several locked offices within that\\nbusiness, would be deemed one criminal episode. Id.\\nat 1026.\\n  Overruling Hudspeth would remove just one of the\\nobstacles to Elliott’s position. It would do away with\\nHudspeth’s bright-line rule and leave room for the\\nmore nuanced judgments for which the dissenters in\\nthat case advocated. If the facts underlying Elliott’s\\nthree prior burglaries were comparable to those at issue\\nin Hudspeth, the door might be open to Elliott’s con-\\ntention that his prior burglaries constituted one criminal\\nepisode for purposes of the ACCA. But Elliott did not\\nburglarize, one right after the other, three business\\nin the same mall or three adjoining townhouses. He\\nburglarized three different residences on different\\ndays.4 Even with Hudspeth cleared from his path, Elliott\\nstill would have to contend with a wealth of authority,\\nincluding precedents like Schieman and Godinez, which\\ntreat crimes committed at different locations and at\\ndifferent times—even when separated only by a matter\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n  Elliott’s counsel informs us, although this fact is not in the\\nrecord, that each of the residences Elliott burglarized were\\napartments essentially in the same complex.

But on that view, even a long\\nstring of crimes, committed over a much greater\\nexpanse of time than Elliott’s burglaries were, could be\\nconstrued as a single criminal episode. An addiction to\\ndrugs or alcohol, for example, may be at the root of crimi-\\nnal behavior that spans years rather than days. (Elliott’s\\nown addiction to multiple narcotics appears to have\\nplagued him for a substantial period of his life.) There\\nmight be some sense in treating a series of crimes as\\nessentially one, indivisible episode, particularly when\\nthe crimes occurred in a discrete part of the defendant’s\\npast and are explained by something like an addiction\\nthat the defendant later overcame. The district judge in\\nthis case himself entertained “long thoughts” about\\nhow Elliott’s prior burglaries were best characterized.\\n2011 WL 3273466, at *1; R. 18-2 at 20.\\n\\x0cNo. 11-2766                                               21\\n\\n  Nonetheless, it is difficult to reconcile Elliott’s theory\\nwith the language that the ACCA uses. The statute\\nrefers to crimes “committed on occasions different from\\none another.” § 924(e)(1). When a day or more has\\npassed between offenses, especially when the offenses\\nwere committed at different locations and against\\ndifferent victims, logic suggests that these crimes\\noccurred on different occasions. See, e.g., United States v.\\nRoss, 569 F.3d 821, 823-24 (8th Cir. 2009) (two crack\\ncocaine sales made three days apart to same informant);\\nUnited States v.

Elliott himself cites no case\\nto the contrary. The cases that he does cite are readily\\ndistinguishable, in that they involve crimes that over-\\nlapped temporally, see United States v. Willoughby, 653\\nF.3d 738, 744-45 (8th Cir. 2011) (near-simultaneous sales\\nof marijuana to police officer and informant as they\\nstood side by side in defendant’s living room); United\\n\\x0c22                                            No. 11-2766\\n\\nStates v. Towne, 870 F.2d 880, 891 (2d Cir. 1989) (kidnap\\nand rape of same victim), or took place on the heels of\\none another, see United States v.

The potential imprisonment range for that crime was 0-6 months under the United States Sentencing Guidelines.  The District Court imposed no prison time, sentencing Granderson instead to 5 years\\' probation and a fine. After Granderson tested positive for cocaine, the court resentenced him under 18 U.S.C. § 3565(a), which provides that if a person serving a sentence of probation possesses illegal drugs, \"the court shall revoke the sentence of probation and sentence the defendant to not less than one-third of the original sentence.\" Accepting the Government\\'s reading of the statute, the District Court concluded that the phrase \"original sentence\" referred to the term of probation actually imposed (60 months), rather than the 0-6 month imprisonment range authorized by the Guidelines. Accordingly, that court resentenced Granderson to 20 months\\' imprisonment.  The Court of Appeals upheld the revocation of Granderson\\'s probation, but vacated his new sentence.  Invoking the rule of lenity, the court agreed with Granderson that \"original sentence\" referred to the potential imprisonment range under the Guidelines, not to the actual probation sentence. Because Granderson had already served 11 months of his revocation sentence—more than the 6-months maximum under the Guidelines —the court ordered him released from custody.\\nHeld:  The minimum revocation sentence under § 3565(a)\\'s drug-possession proviso is one-third the maximum of the originally applicable Guidelines range of imprisonment, and the maximum revocation sentence is the Guidelines maximum.  Pp. ____.\\n(a) The Government is correct that the proviso mandates imprisonment, not renewed probation, as the required type of punishment.  The contrast in §§ 3565(a)(1) and (2) between \"continu[ing]\" and \"revok[ing]\" probation as the alternative punishments for a defendant who violates a probation condition suggests that a revocation sentence must be a sentence of imprisonment, not a continuation of probation.  Moreover, it would be absurd to punish drug-possessing probationers by revoking their probation and imposing a new term of probation no longer than the original.  However, the Government contends incorrectly that the term \"original sentence\" unambiguously calls for a sentence based on the term of probation.  The statutory language appears to differentiate, not to equate or amalgamate, \"the sentence of probation\" and \"the original sentence.\"  The Government\\'s interpretation, furthermore, reads the proviso\\'s word \"sentence\" inconsistently.  Pp. ____.\\n(b) Under Granderson\\'s reading of the proviso, the \"original sentence\" that sets the duration of the revocation sentence is the applicable Guidelines sentence of imprisonment, not the revoked term of probation.  That reading avoids both the linguistic anomalies presented by the Government\\'s construction and the sentencing disparities that would attend the Government\\'s interpretation.  Furthermore, contrary to the Government\\'s arguments, Granderson\\'s reading satisfies the statute\\'s purpose by treating the class of drug possessors more severely than other probation violators, and the proviso need not be interpreted in pari materia with the discrete, differently worded provision prescribing revocation of the supervised release of drug possessors.  Moreover, the proviso\\'s history furnishes additional cause to resist the Government\\'s interpretation, for it indicates that the proviso may not have received Congress\\' careful attention and may have been composed with an obsolete federal sentencing regime in the drafter\\'s mind.  In these circumstances, where the text, structure, and statutory history fail to establish that the Government\\'s position is unambiguously correct, the rule of lenity operates to resolve the statutory ambiguity in Granderson\\'s favor. Pp. ____.\\n(c) The benchmark for the revocation sentence under the proviso is the maximum Guidelines sentence of imprisonment.  Pp. ____.\\n(d) Because Granderson\\'s maximum revocation sentence under the proviso was 6 months, and because he had already served 11 months imprisonment at the time the Court of Appeals issued its decision, that court correctly ordered his release.  P. ____.\\n969 F.2d 980 (CA11 1992), affirmed.\\nGINSBURG, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which BLACKMUN, STEVENS, O\\'CONNOR, and SOUTER, JJ., joined.  SCALIA, J., and KENNEDY, J., filed opinions concurring in the judgment. REHNQUIST, C.J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which THOMAS, J., joined.\\nThomas G. Hungar, for petitioner.\\nGregory S. Smith, appointed by this Court, for respondent.\\nJustice GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n\\n\\n1\\nThis case presents a question of statutory interpretation regarding revocation of a federal sentence of probation.  The law at issue provides that if a person serving a sentence of probation possesses illegal drugs, \"the court shall revoke the sentence of probation and sentence the defendant to not less than one-third of the original sentence.\"  18 U.S.C. § 3565(a).  Congress did not further define the critical term \"original sentence,\" nor are those words, unmodified, used elsewhere in the Federal Criminal Code chapter on sentencing.  Embedded in that context, the words \"original sentence\" in § 3565(a) are susceptible to at least three interpretations.\\n\\n\\n2\\nRead in isolation, the provision could be taken to mean the reimposition of a sentence of probation, for a period not less than one-third of the original sentence of probation.  This construction, however, is implausible, and has been urged by neither party, for it would generally demand no increased sanction, plainly not what Congress intended.\\n\\n\\n3\\nThe Government, petitioner here, reads the provision to draw the time period from the initially imposed sentence of probation, but to require incarceration, not renewed probation, for not less than one-third of that period.  On the Government\\'s reading, accepted by the District Court, respondent Granderson would face a 20-month mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment.\\n\\n\\n4\\nGranderson maintains that \"original sentence\" refers to the sentence of incarceration he could have received initially, in lieu of the sentence of probation, under the United States Sentencing Guidelines.  Granderson\\'s construction calls for a 2-month mandatory minimum.  The Court of Appeals accepted Granderson\\'s interpretation, see 969 F.2d 980 (CA11 1992); returns in other circuits are divided.1\\n\\n\\n5\\nThe \"original sentence\" prescription of § 3565(a) was a late-hour addition to the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, a sprawling enactment that takes up 364 pages in Statutes at Large.  Pub.L. 100-690, 102 Stat. 4181-4545.  The provision appears not to have received Congress\\' careful attention.  It may have been composed, we suggest below, with the pre-1984 federal sentencing regime in the drafter\\'s mind;  it does not easily adapt to the regime established by the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.\\n\\n\\n6\\nAccording the statute a sensible construction, we recognize, in common with all courts that have grappled with the \"original sentence\" conundrum, that Congress prescribed imprisonment as the type of punishment for drug-possessing probationers.2  As to the duration of that punishment, we rest on the principle that \" \\'the Court will not interpret a federal criminal statute so as to increase the penalty . . . when such an interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what Congress intended.\\' \" Bifulco v. United States, 447 U.S. 381, 387, 100 S.Ct. 2247, 2252, 65 L.Ed.2d 205 (1980), quoting Ladner v. United States, 358 U.S. 169, 178, 79 S.Ct. 209, 214, 3 L.Ed.2d 199 (1958).  We therefore adopt Granderson\\'s interpretation and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\\n\\n\\n7\\n* Granderson, a letter carrier, pleaded guilty to one count of destruction of mail, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1703(a).  Under the Sentencing Guidelines, the potential imprisonment range, derived from the character of the offense and the offender\\'s criminal history category, was 0-6 months.  The District Court imposed no prison time, but sentenced Granderson to 5 years\\' probation and a $2,000 fine.3  As a standard condition of probation, Granderson was required to submit periodically to urinary testing for illegal drug use.\\n\\n\\n8\\nSeveral weeks after his original sentencing, Granderson tested positive for cocaine, and his probation officer petitioned for revocation of the sentence of probation.  Finding that Granderson had possessed cocaine, the District Court revoked Granderson\\'s sentence of probation and undertook to resentence him, pursuant to § 3565(a), to incarceration for \"not less than one-third of the original sentence.\"  The term \"original sentence,\" the District Court concluded, referred to the term of probation actually imposed (60 months) rather than the imprisonment range authorized by the Guidelines (0-6 months).  The court accordingly sentenced Granderson to 20 months\\' imprisonment.\\n\\n\\n9\\nThe Court of Appeals upheld the revocation of the sentence of probation but vacated Granderson\\'s new sentence.  969 F.2d 980 (CA11 1992).  That court observed that the probation revocation sentence of 20 months\\' imprisonment imposed by the District Court was far longer than the sentence that could have been imposed either for the underlying crime of destroying mail (six months) or for the crime of cocaine possession (one year).  Id., at 983, and n. 2.  The Court of Appeals called it \"legal alchemy\" to convert an \"original sentence\" of \"conditional liberty,\" with a correspondingly long term, into a sentence of imprisonment with a time span geared to the lesser restraint.  Id., at 984, quoting United States v. Gordon, 961 F.2d 426, 432 (CA3 1992).  Invoking the rule of lenity, id., at 983, the court concluded that the phrase \"original sentence\" referred to \"the [0-6 month] sentence of incarceration faced by Granderson under the Guidelines,\" not to the 60-month sentence of probation.  Id., at 984.  Because Granderson had served 11 months of his revocation sentence—more than the 6-month maximum—the Court of Appeals ordered him released from custody.  Id., at 985.\\n\\nII\\nThe text of § 3565(a) reads:\\n\\n10\\n\"If the defendant violates a condition of probation at any      time prior to the expiration or termination of the term of      probation, the court may . . .\\n\\n\\n11\\n\"(1) continue him on probation, with or without      extending the term or modifying or enlarging the conditions;      or\\n\\n\\n12\\n\"(2) revoke the sentence of probation and impose any      other sentence that was available . . . at the time of the      initial sentencing.\\n\\n\\n13\\n\"Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if a      defendant is found by the court to be in possession of a      controlled substance . . . the court shall revoke the      sentence of probation and sentence the defendant to not less      than one-third of the original sentence.\"  (Emphasis      supplied.)\\n\\n\\n14\\nThe Government argues that the italicized proviso is unambiguous.  The \"original sentence\" that establishes the benchmark for the revocation sentence, the Government asserts, can only be the very sentence actually imposed, i.e., the sentence of probation.  In this case, the sentence of probation was 60 months; \"one-third of the original sentence\" is thus 20 months.  But for two reasons, the Government continues, Granderson\\'s 20-month revocation sentence must be one of imprisonment rather than probation.  First, the contrast in subsections (1) and (2) between \"continu[ing]\" and \"revok[ing]\" probation suggests that a revocation sentence must be a sentence of imprisonment, not a continuation of probation.  Second, the Government urges, it would be absurd to \"punish\" drug-possessing probationers by revoking their probation and imposing a new term of probation no longer than the original.  Congress could not be taken to have selected drug possessors, from the universe of all probation violators, for more favorable treatment, the Government reasons, particularly not under a provision enacted as part of a statute called \"The Anti-Drug Abuse Act.\"\\n\\n\\n15\\nWe agree, for the reasons stated by the Government, that a revocation sentence must be a term of imprisonment.  Otherwise the proviso at issue would make little sense.4  We do not agree, however, that the term \"original sentence\" relates to the duration of the sentence set for probation.  The statute provides that if a probationer possesses drugs, \"the court shall revoke the sentence of probation and sentence the defendant to not less than one-third of the original sentence.\"  This language appears to differentiate, not to equate or amalgamate, \"the sentence of probation\" and \"the original sentence.\"  See United States v. Penn, 17 F.3d 70, 73 (CA4 1994) (\"a sentence of probation does not equate to a sentence of incarceration\").  If Congress wished to convey the meaning pressed by the Government, it could easily have instructed that the defendant be incarcerated for a term \"not less than one-third of the original sentence of probation,\" or \"not less than one-third of the revoked term of probation.\"\\n\\n\\n16\\nThe Government\\'s interpretation has a further textual difficulty.  The Government reads the word \"sentence,\" when used as a verb in the proviso\\'s phrase \"sentence the defendant,\" to mean \"sentence to imprisonment\" rather than \"sentence to probation.\"  Yet, when the word \"sentence\" next appears, this time as a noun (\"original sentence\"), the Government reads the word to mean \"sentence of probation.\"  Again, had Congress designed the language to capture the Government\\'s construction, the proviso might have read:  \"the court shall revoke the sentence of probation and sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment whose length is not less than one-third the length of the original sentence of probation.\"  Cf. Reves v. Ernst & Young, 507 U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 1163, 1169, 122 L.Ed.2d 525 (1993) (\"it seems reasonable to give . . . a similar construction\" to a word used as both a noun and a verb in a single statutory sentence).\\n\\n\\n17\\nAs the Court of Appeals commented, \"[p]robation and imprisonment are not fungible\";  they are sentences fundamentally different in character.  969 F.2d, at 984.  One-third of a 60-month term of probation or \"conditional liberty\" is a sentence scarcely resembling a 20-month sentence of imprisonment.  The Government insists and, as already noted, we agree, that the revocation sentence, measured as one-third of the \"original sentence,\" must be a sentence of imprisonment.  But that \"must be\" suggests that \"original sentence\" refers the resentencer back to an anterior sentence of imprisonment, not a sentence of probation.\\n\\nIII\\n\\n18\\nGranderson\\'s reading of the § 3565(a) proviso entails such a reference back.  The words \"original sentence,\" he contends, refer back to § 3565(a)(2), the prescription immediately preceding the drug-possession proviso:  the \"other sentence that was available under subchapter A [the general sentencing provisions] at the time of the initial sentencing.\"  The Guidelines sentence of imprisonment authorized by subchapter A was the \"original sentence,\" Granderson argues, for it was the presumptive sentence, the punishment that probation, as a discretionary alternative, replaced.  The Guidelines range of imprisonment available at Granderson\\'s initial sentencing for destruction of mail was 0-6 months.  Starting at the top of this range, Granderson arrives at 2 months as the minimum revocation sentence.\\n\\nA.\\n\\n19\\nGranderson\\'s interpretation avoids linguistic anomalies presented by the Government\\'s construction.  First, Granderson\\'s reading differentiates, as does the proviso, between \"the sentence of probation\" that the resentencer must revoke and \"the original sentence\" that determines the duration of the revocation sentence. See supra, at ____.  Second, Granderson\\'s construction keeps constant the meaning of \"sentence\" in the phrases \"sentence the defendant\" and \"original sentence.\"  See supra, at ____.  While the Government cannot easily explain how multiplying a sentence of probation by one-third can yield a sentence of imprisonment, Granderson\\'s construction encounters no such shoal.  See Gordon, 961 F.2d, at 433 (\"one-third of three years probation is one year probation, not one year imprisonment \").5\\n\\n\\n20\\nGranderson\\'s reading of the proviso also avoids the startling disparities in sentencing that would attend the Government\\'s interpretation.  A 20-month minimum sentence would exceed not only the 6-month maximum punishment under the Guidelines for Granderson\\'s original offense;  it would also exceed the one-year statutory maximum, see 21 U.S.C. § 844(a), that Granderson could have received, had the Government prosecuted him for cocaine possession and afforded him the full constitutional protections of a criminal trial, rather than the limited protections of a revocation hearing.6  Indeed, a 20-month sentence would exceed consecutive sentences for destruction of mail and cocaine possession (18 months in all).\\n\\n\\n21\\nFurthermore, twenty months is only the minimum revocation sentence, on the Government\\'s reading of the proviso.  The Government\\'s interpretation would have allowed the District Court to sentence Granderson to a term of imprisonment equal in length to the revoked term of probation.  This prison term—five years would be ten times the exposure to imprisonment Granderson faced under the Guidelines for his original offense, and five times the applicable statutory maximum for cocaine possession.  It seems unlikely that Congress could have intended so to enlarge the District Court\\'s discretion.  See Penn, 17 F.3d 73.7\\n\\nB\\n\\n22\\nTwo of the Government\\'s arguments against Granderson\\'s interpretation are easily answered.  First, the Government observes that the purpose of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act was to impose tough sanctions on drug abusers.  See Brief for United States 22-26 (listing new penalties and quoting statements from members of Congress that they intended to punish drug offenders severely). But we cannot divine from the legislators\\' many \"get tough on drug offenders\" statements any reliable guidance to particular provisions.  None of the legislators\\' expressions, as the Government admits, focuses on \"the precise meaning of the provision at issue in this case.\"  Id., at 24, and n. 4;  cf. Busic v. United States, 446 U.S. 398, 408, 100 S.Ct. 1747, 1754, 64 L.Ed.2d 381 (1980) (\"[W]hile Congress had a general desire to deter firearm abuses, that desire was not unbounded.  Our task here is to locate one of the boundaries, and the inquiry is not advanced by the assertion that Congress wanted no boundaries.\"). Under Granderson\\'s interpretation, moreover, drug possessors are hardly favored.  Instead, they are singled out among probation violators for particularly adverse treatment:  They face mandatory, rather than optional, terms of imprisonment.\\n\\n\\n23\\nNext, the Government argues that the drug-possession proviso must be construed in pari materia with the parallel provision, added at the same time, governing revocation of supervised release upon a finding of drug possession.  In the latter provision, the Government observes, Congress ordered a revocation sentence of \"not less than one-third of the term of supervised release,\" and it expressly provided that the revocation sentence should be \"serve[d] in prison.\"  18 U.S.C. § 3583(g).  Correspondingly, the Government maintains, the probation revocation proviso should be construed to require a minimum prison term of one-third of the term of probation.  The Government acknowledges that, while Congress spelled out \"one-third of the term of supervised release,\" Congress did not similarly say \"one-third of the term of probation.\"  However, the Government attributes this difference to the fact that, unlike probation under the current sentencing regime, supervised release is not itself an \"original sentence,\" it is only a component of a sentence that commences with imprisonment.\\n\\n\\n24\\nWe are not persuaded that the supervised release revocation prescription should control construction of the probation revocation proviso.  Supervised release, in contrast to probation, is not a punishment in lieu of incarceration.  Persons serving post-incarceration terms of supervised release generally are more serious offenders than are probationers.  But terms of supervised release, because they follow up prison terms, are often shorter than initial sentences of probation.8  Thus, under the Government\\'s in pari materia approach, drug possessors whose original offense warranted the more serious sanction of prison plus supervised release would often receive shorter revocation sentences than would drug-possessing probationers.\\n\\n\\n25\\nThe Government counters that Congress might have intended to punish probationers more severely because they were \"extended special leniency.\"  Reply Brief for United States 13, n. 14.  A sentence of probation, however, even if \"lenient,\" ordinarily reflects the judgment that the offense and offender\\'s criminal history were not so serious as to warrant imprisonment.  In sum, probation sans imprisonment and supervised release following imprisonment are sentences of unlike character.  This fact weighs heavily against the argument that the discrete, differently worded probation and supervised release revocation provisions should be construed in pari materia.\\n\\nC\\n\\n26\\nThe history of the probation revocation proviso\\'s enactment gives us additional cause to resist the Government\\'s interpretation.  The Anti-Drug Abuse Act, in which the proviso was included, was a large and complex measure, described by one member of the House of Representatives as \"more like a telephone book than a piece of legislation.\"  134 Cong.Rec. 33290 (1988) (remarks of Rep. Conte).  The proviso seems first to have appeared in roughly its present form as a Senate floor amendment offered after both the House and the Senate had passed the bill.  See id., at 24924-24925 (House passage, Sept. 22);  id., at 30826 (Senate passage, Oct. 14);  id., at 30945 (proviso included in lengthy set of amendments proposed by Sen. Nunn, Oct. 14).  No conference report addresses the provision, nor are we aware of any post-conference discussion of the issue.9  The proviso thus seems to have been inserted into the Anti-Drug Abuse Act without close inspection.  Cf. United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 344, 92 S.Ct. 515, 520-521, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971) (applying rule of lenity, noting that statutory provision \"was a last-minute Senate amendment\" to a long and complex bill and \"was hastily passed, with little discussion, no hearings, and no report\").\\n\\n\\n27\\nAnother probation-related provision of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, proposed shortly before the proviso, casts further doubt on the Government\\'s reading.  That provision amends the prohibition against using or carrying an explosive in the commission of a federal felony, to provide in part:  \"Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court shall not place on probation or suspend the sentence of any person convicted of a violation of this subsection. . . .\"  Pub.L. 100-690, § 6474(b), 102 Stat. 4380, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 844(h) (emphasis supplied).  This provision, notwithstanding its 1988 date of enactment, is intelligible only under pre-1984 law:  the 1984 Sentencing Reform Act had abolished suspended sentences, and the phrase \"place on probation\" had yielded to the phrase \"impose a sentence of probation.\"\\n\\n\\n28\\nGranderson\\'s counsel suggested at oral argument, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 22-23, 29-31, 36-41, that the proviso\\'s drafters might similarly have had in mind the pre-1984 sentencing regime, in particular, the pre-1984 practice of imposing a sentence of imprisonment, suspending its execution, and placing the defendant on probation.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3651 (1982) (for any offense \"not punishable by death or life imprisonment,\" the court may \"suspend the imposition or execution of sentence and place the defendant on probation for such period and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems best\").  The proviso would fit the suspension-of-execution scheme precisely:  The \"original sentence\" would be the sentence imposed but not executed, and one-third of that determinate sentence would be the revocation sentence.  In that application, the proviso would avoid incongruities presented in Granderson\\'s and the Government\\'s interpretations of the words \"original sentence\":  an imposed, albeit unexecuted, term of imprisonment would be an actual rather than a merely available sentence, and one-third of that sentence would be a term of imprisonment, not probation.  If Granderson could demonstrate that the proviso\\'s drafters in fact drew the prescription to match the pre-1984 suspension-of-execution scheme, Granderson\\'s argument would be all the more potent:  The closest post-1984 analogue to the suspended sentence is the Guidelines sentence of imprisonment that could have been implemented, but was held back in favor of a probation sentence.10\\n\\n\\n29\\nWe cannot say with assurance that the proviso\\'s drafters chose the term \"original sentence\" with a view toward pre-1984 law.11  The unexacting process by which the proviso was enacted, however, and the evident anachronism in another probation-related section of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, leave us doubtful that it was Congress\\' design to punish drug-possessing probationers with the extraordinarily disproportionate severity the Government urges.\\n\\n\\n30\\nIn these circumstances—where text, structure, and history fail to establish that the Government\\'s position is unambiguously correct—we apply the rule of lenity and resolve the ambiguity in Granderson\\'s favor.  See, e.g., Bass, 404 U.S., at 347-349, 92 S.Ct., at 522-523.  We decide that the \"original sentence\" that sets the duration of the revocation sentence is the applicable Guidelines sentence of imprisonment, not the revoked term of probation.12\\n\\nIV\\n\\n31\\nWe turn, finally, to the Government\\'s argument that Granderson\\'s theory, and the Court of Appeals\\' analysis, are fatally flawed because the Guidelines specify not a term but a range—in this case, 0-6 months.  Calculating the minimum revocation sentence as one-third of that range, the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment would be 0-2 months, the Government asserts, which would permit a perverse result:  A resentencing court could revoke a drug possessor\\'s sentence of probation, and then impose no sentence at all.  Recognizing this curiosity, lower courts have used not 0-6 months as their starting place, but the top of that range, as the \"original sentence,\" which yields two months as the minimum revocation sentence.  The Government complains that no court has explained why the top, rather than the middle or the bottom of the range, is the appropriate point of reference.13\\n\\n\\n32\\nThe reason for starting at the top of the range, however, is evident:  No other solution yields as sensible a response to the \"original sentence\" conundrum.  Four measures of the minimum revocation sentence could be hypothesized as possibilities, if the applicable Guidelines range is the starting point:  The sentence could be calculated as (1) one-third of the Guidelines maximum, (2) one-third of the Guidelines minimum, (3) one-third of some point between the minimum and maximum, such as the midpoint, or (4) one-third of the range itself.  The latter two possibilities can be quickly eliminated.  Selecting a point between minimum and maximum, whether the midpoint or some other point, would be purely arbitrary.  Calculating the minimum revocation sentence as one-third of the Guidelines range, in practical application, yields the same result as setting the minimum revocation sentence at one-third of the Guidelines minimum:  To say, for example, that a 2-4 month sentence is the minimum revocation sentence is effectively to say that a 2-month sentence is the minimum.\\n\\n\\n33\\nUsing the Guidelines minimum in cases such as the present one (0-6 month range), as already noted, would yield a minimum revocation sentence of zero, a result incompatible with the apparent objective of the proviso—to assure that those whose probation is revoked for drug possession serve a term of imprisonment.  The maximum Guidelines sentence as the benchmark for the revocation sentence, on the other hand, is \"a sensible construction\" that avoids attributing to the legislature either \"an unjust or an absurd conclusion.\"  In re Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 667, 17 S.Ct. 677, 680, 41 L.Ed. 1154 (1897).14\\n\\nV\\n\\n34\\nWe decide, in sum, that the drug-possession proviso of § 3565(a) establishes a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment, but we reject the Government\\'s contention that the proviso unambiguously calls for a sentence based on the term of probation rather than the originally applicable Guidelines range of imprisonment.  Granderson\\'s interpretation, if not flawless, is a securely plausible reading of the statutory language, and it avoids the textual difficulties and sentencing disparities we identified in the Government\\'s position.  In these circumstances, in common with the Court of Appeals, we apply the rule of lenity and resolve the ambiguity in Granderson\\'s favor.  The minimum revocation sentence, we hold, is one-third the maximum of the originally applicable Guidelines range,15 and the maximum revocation sentence is the Guidelines maximum.\\n\\n\\n35\\nIn this case, the maximum revocation sentence is 6 months. Because Granderson had served 11 months imprisonment by the time the Court of Appeals issued its decision, that court correctly ordered his release.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore\\n\\n\\n36\\n\\nAffirmed.\\n\\n\\n\\n37\\nJustice SCALIA, concurring in the judgment.\\n\\n\\n38\\nMy view of this case is close to, but not precisely, that of Justice KENNEDY.  I agree with him, for the reasons he well expresses, that the only linguistically tenable interpretation of 18 U.S.C. § 3565(a) establishes as a floor a sentence one-third of the sentence originally imposed, but leaves the district court free to impose any greater sentence available for the offense under the United States Code and the Sentencing Guidelines. Wherein I differ is that I do not believe (as he does) that only the probation element of the original sentence is to be considered i.e., as he puts it, \"that the term \\'original sentence\\' refers to the sentence of probation a defendant received at the initial sentencing.\"  Post, at ____ (emphasis added).  (THE CHIEF JUSTICE also espouses this view, see post, at ____.)  It seems to me that the term must refer to the entire original sentence;  where that includes a fine in addition to the probation, the fine also is included.  Thus, one-third of a sentence consisting of three years\\' probation and a $3,000 fine would be not merely one year\\'s probation but a $1,000 fine as well.  Even the majority, to maintain some measure of consistency in its strained interpretation of \"original sentence,\" ought to consider, in addition to \"the applicable Guidelines sentence of imprisonment,\" ante, at ____, the equally applicable range of fines set forth in the Guidelines, see United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual § 5E1.2(c)(3) (Nov. 1993).*\\n\\n\\n39\\nBoth under my analysis, and under Justice KENNEDY\\'s, there exists a problem of comparing the incomparable that ought to be acknowledged.  Since Granderson\\'s original sentence was 60 months\\' probation plus a $2,000 fine, I must, in order to concur in today\\'s judgment, conclude, as I do, that the five extra months of prison (beyond the Guidelines\\' 6-month maximum imposable for the original offense) which Granderson has served are worth at least $667 (one-third the original fine) and that 11 months in prison are the equivalent of 20 months\\' probation plus a $667 fine because otherwise I would have to consider imposing some or all of the $5,000 maximum fine imposable for the original offense, see USSG § 5E1.2(c)(3), or indeed consider departing upward from the applicable Guidelines range, see 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b), towards the 5-year imprisonment that is the statutory maximum for the offense, see 18 U.S.C. § 1703(a).  And Justice KENNEDY, even if he takes only the probation into account for purposes of determining the \"original sentence,\" must still conclude, it seems to me, that 11 months in prison is at least the equivalent of 20 months\\' probation—because otherwise he would have to consider imposing some or all of the available $5,000 fine or departing upward from the Guidelines.\\n\\n\\n40\\nIt is no easy task to determine how many days\\' imprisonment equals how many dollars\\' fine equals how many months\\' probation. Comparing the incommensurate is always a tricky business.  See, e.g., Bendix Autolite Corp. v. Midwesco Enterprises, Inc., 486 U.S. 888, 897, 108 S.Ct. 2218, 2223-2224, 100 L.Ed.2d 896 (1988) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).  I frankly doubt that those who drafted and adopted this language intended to impose that task upon us;  but I can neither pronounce the results reached by a straightforward reading of the statute utterly absurd nor discern any other self-evident disposition for which they are an obviously mistaken replacement.  Cf. Green v. Bock Laundry Machine Co., 490 U.S. 504, 527, 109 S.Ct. 1981, 1994, 104 L.Ed.2d 557 (1989) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment).  It seems to me that the other interpretations proposed today suffer, in varying degrees, the double curse of producing neither textually faithful results nor plausibly intended ones.  It is best, as usual, to apply the statute as written, and to let Congress make the needed repairs.  That repairs are needed is perhaps the only thing about this wretchedly drafted statute that we can all agree upon.\\n\\n\\n41\\nFor these reasons, I concur in the judgment of the Court.\\n\\n\\n42\\nJustice KENNEDY, concurring in the judgment.\\n\\n\\n43\\nThe Court\\'s holding that the drug proviso in 18 U.S.C. § 3565(a) calls for a mandatory minimum sentence of two months in prison rests upon two premises:  first, that the term \"original sentence\" means the maximum Guidelines sentence that the district court could have, but did not, impose at the initial sentencing; and, second, that the verb \"sentence\" means only \"sentence to imprisonment.\"  Neither premise is correct.  As close analysis of the text and structure of the statute demonstrates, the proviso requires a mandatory minimum sentence of a probation term one-third the length of the initial term of probation.  I concur in the judgment only because Granderson, under my reading of the statute, was entitled to release from prison.\\n\\n\\n44\\n* Section 3565(a) provides, in relevant part:\\n\\n\\n45\\n\"If the defendant violates a condition of probation at any      time prior to the expiration or termination of the term of      probation, the court may . . .\\n\\n\\n46\\n\"(1) continue him on probation, with or without      extending the term or modifying or enlarging the conditions;      or\\n\\n\\n47\\n\"(2) revoke the sentence of probation and impose any      other sentence that was available under subchapter A at the      time of the initial sentencing.\\n\\n\\n48\\n\"Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if      a defendant is found by the court to be in possession of a      controlled substance, thereby violating the condition imposed      by section 3563(a)(3), the court shall revoke the sentence of      probation and sentence the defendant to not less than      one-third of the original sentence.\"  (Emphasis supplied.)\\n\\n\\n49\\nThe Court construes the term \"original sentence\" to refer to the maximum sentence of imprisonment available under the Guidelines at the initial sentencing.  I accept, in substantial part, THE CHIEF JUSTICE\\'s critique of the Court\\'s strained interpretation, and agree with him that \"original sentence\" refers to the sentence of probation a defendant in fact received at the initial sentencing.  It is true that the term \"original sentence,\" standing alone, could be read to encompass the entire original sentence, including any fine imposed.  When considered in context, however, it is preferable to construe the term to refer only to the original sentence of probation.  The proviso instructs the district court to \"revoke the sentence of probation,\" but says nothing about the fine imposed at the initial sentencing.  Given this, the subsequent reference to \"one-third of the original sentence\" is better read to mean the probation component of the original sentence, and not the whole sentence.\\n\\n\\n50\\nI disagree with both the Court and THE CHIEF JUSTICE, however, in their conclusion that the verb \"sentence\" in the proviso means only \"sentence to imprisonment.\"  Given the statutory text and structure, the verb \"sentence\" can mean either \"sentence to probation\" or \"sentence to imprisonment.\"  It follows, in my view, that the drug proviso calls for a mandatory minimum sentence equal to a probation term one-third the length of the original term of probation.\\n\\n\\n51\\nBefore 1984, fines and imprisonment were the only sentences in the federal system;  probation, by contrast, was an alternative to sentencing.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3651 (1982).  In the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Congress altered this understanding and made probation a kind of sentence.  See § 3561(a) (defendant \"may be sentenced to a term of probation\");  United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual ch. 7, pt. A2(a), at 379 (Nov. 1993) (\"[T]he Sentencing Reform Act recognized probation as a sentence in itself\").  Probation no longer entails some deviation from a presumptive sentence of imprisonment, as the facts of this case illustrate.  Granderson\\'s conviction for destruction of mail, when considered in light of his criminal history category, placed him in Zone A of the Guidelines Sentencing Table, which carries a presumptive sentence of 0 to 6 months.  The Sentencing Guidelines authorize a sentence of probation for defendants falling within Zone A, see USSG § 5B1.1(a)(1), and set a maximum probation term of five years for the subset of Zone A defendants of which Granderson is a member, see § 5B1.2(a)(1).  For defendants like Granderson, then, probation is a sentence available at the initial sentencing, no less so than a sentence of imprisonment.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(4) (the court, in determining sentence, \"shall consider . . . the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for the applicable category of offense . . . as set forth in the guidelines\") (emphasis supplied).  Because the term \"to sentence,\" if left unadorned, can bear any one of three meanings, Congress took care, as a general matter, to specify the type of punishment called for when it used \"sentence\" as a verb in Chapter 227 of Title 18, the sentencing provisions of the criminal code.  See, e.g., § 3561(a) (\"sentenced to a term of probation\"), § 3572(e) (\"sentenced to pay a fine\"), § 3583(a) (\"impos[e] a sentence to a term of imprisonment\").\\n\\n\\n52\\nCongress was less careful when drafting the provision now before us, which does not specify whether the district court should impose a fine, imprisonment, or another term of probation when revoking the original term of probation on account of drug possession.  The Government brushes aside this significant ambiguity, contending that \"the language of the statute, in context,\" demonstrates that Congress \"plainly intended\" to require imprisonment.  Brief for Respondent 14, 15.  The Government is correct to say that we must examine the context of the proviso to ascertain its meaning.  See Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 809, 109 S.Ct. 1500, 1504-1505, 103 L.Ed.2d 891 (1989).  Close attention to that context, however, leads me to conclude that Congress did not intend to require imprisonment upon revocation of the original term of probation.\\n\\n\\n53\\nCongress enacted the drug proviso as § 7303(a)(2) of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (1988 Act).  Pub.L. 100-690, 102 Stat. 4181, 4464.  Section § 7303(b)(2) of the 1988 Act, which concerns defendants serving a term of supervised release, provides that \"[i]f the defendant is found by the court to be in the possession of a controlled substance, the court shall terminate the term of supervised release and require the defendant to serve in prison not less than one-third of the term of supervised release.\"  102 Stat. 4464, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3583(g) (emphasis supplied).\\n\\n\\n54\\nSections 7303(a)(2) and (b)(2) are, as the Government puts it, \"parallel and closely related.\"  Brief for United States 26. Both pertain to the consequences of drug possession for defendants under some form of non-custodial supervision.  They differ, of course, in one fundamental respect:  Section 7303(b)(2) explicitly provides for a revocation sentence of imprisonment, while § 7303(a)(2) does not.  The difference is significant.  \" \\'[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\\' \"  Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U.S. 395, 404, 111 S.Ct. 840, 846-847, 112 L.Ed.2d 919 (1991), quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 23, 104 S.Ct. 296, 300, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983) (internal quotations omitted).  The presumption loses some of its force when the sections in question are dissimilar and scattered at distant points of a lengthy and complex enactment.  But in this case, given the parallel structure of §§ 7303(a)(2) and (b)(2) and the fact that Congress enacted both provisions in the same section of the same Act, the presumption is strong.  The disparate use of the term \"to serve in prison\" is compelling evidence that Congress intended to mandate incarceration as a revocation punishment in § 7303(b)(2), but not in § 7303(a)(2) (the § 3565(a) drug proviso).\\n\\n\\n55\\nThe Government interposes a structural argument of its own. Before enactment of the drug proviso in the 1988 Act, § 3565(a) consisted only of subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2), which, for all relevant purposes, took the same form as they do now.  Those provisions grant courts two options for defendants who violate probation conditions that do not involve drugs or guns.  Section 3565(a)(1) permits a court to continue the defendant on probation, with or without extending the term or modifying or enlarging the conditions.  As an alternative, § 3565(a)(2) permits a court to \"revoke the sentence of probation and impose any other sentence that was available . . . at the time of the initial sentencing.\" According to the Government, the two provisions make clear that the consequence of revocation under § 3565(a)(2) is that, in light of § 3565(a)(1), the court must impose a sentence other than probation, namely imprisonment.  The meaning borne by the phrase \"revoke the sentence of probation\" in § 3565(a)(2), the Government concludes, must carry over when the same phrase appears in the drug proviso.\\n\\n\\n56\\nThis argument, which the Court accepts, see ante, at ____, is not convincing.  The conclusion that § 3565(a)(2) demands imprisonment upon revocation of the original sentence of probation does not rest upon anything inherent in the phrase \"revoke the sentence of probation.\"  Rather, it follows from the structure of §§ 3565(a)(1) and (a)(2).  Congress set off subsection (a)(2) as an alternative to subsection (a)(1), which provides for every conceivable probation option.  Thus, in order to make sense of the statutory scheme, § 3565(a)(2) should be read to require a punishment of something other than probation:  imprisonment.  That consequence, however, is due to the juxtaposition of subsection (a)(2) with subsection (a)(1), not to Congress\\' use of the phrase \"revoke the sentence of probation\" in § 3565(a)(2).  Taken by itself, that phrase requires termination of the original sentence of probation, but does not indicate the kind of sentence that must be imposed in its place.  The meaning assumed by the phrase \"revoke the sentence of probation\" in the particular context of § 3565(a)(2), then, does not travel when the same phrase appears in a different context.\\n\\n\\n57\\nThe Government\\'s argument that \"revoke the sentence of probation,\" standing alone, must import a sentence of imprisonment also fails to account for how similar language is used in § 7303(b)(2) of the 1988 Act.  That provision, as noted above, states that \"the court shall terminate the term of supervised release and require the defendant to serve in prison not less than one-third of the term of supervised release\" if a defendant is found in possession of drugs.  18 U.S.C. § 3583(g) (emphasis supplied).  The statutory text suggests that a subsequent sentence of imprisonment is not implicit in the phrase \"the court shall terminate the term of supervised release\";  had it been, Congress would not have felt it necessary to mandate imprisonment in an explicit manner.  So there is little reason to think that Congress believed imprisonment to be implicit in the parallel phrase \"the court shall revoke the sentence of probation\" in the § 3565(a) drug proviso, § 7303(a)(2) of the 1988 Act.\\n\\n\\n58\\nThe Government\\'s view suffers from a final infirmity.  The term \"original sentence\" refers to the sentence of probation imposed at the initial sentencing.  So if the proviso imposed a minimum punishment of incarceration, the length of incarceration must be tied to the length of the revoked sentence of probation. That would be an odd result.  \"[I]mprisonment is an \\'intrinsically different\\' form of punishment\" than probation.  Blanton v. North Las Vegas, 489 U.S. 538, 542, 109 S.Ct. 1289, 1292, 103 L.Ed.2d 550 (1989), quoting Muniz v. Hoffman, 422 U.S. 454, 477, 95 S.Ct. 2178, 2191, 45 L.Ed.2d 319 (1975).  Without belaboring the point, probation is a form of \"conditional liberty,\" Black v. Romano, 471 U.S. 606, 611, 105 S.Ct. 2254, 2257, 85 L.Ed.2d 636 (1985), while imprisonment is nothing of the sort.  Transforming a sentence of probation into a prison term via some mathematical formula would, in the words of one court to have considered this issue, constitute a form of \"legal alchemy.\"  United States v. Gordon, 961 F.2d 426, 433 (CA3 1992).  In all events, it is not what one would expect in the ordinary course.\\n\\n\\n59\\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE is correct, of course, to say that it would not be irrational for Congress to tie a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment to the length of the original probation term. Post, at ____.  He is also correct to observe that Congress would have been within its powers to write such a result into law, and that Congress indeed provided for a similar result in § 7303(b)(2) of the 1988 Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3583(g).  Post, at ____.  But these observations do not speak to the only relevant question:  whether Congress did so in the text of the § 3565(a) drug proviso, viewed in light of the statutory structure.  For all of the above reasons, in my view it did not.\\n\\n\\n60\\nIn sum, the drug proviso does not mandate incarceration, but rather must be read to permit a revocation sentence of probation. Concluding that the mandatory minimum sentence is a term of imprisonment would be inconsistent with this reading, and would also lead to the anomaly of tying the length of the mandated prison term to the original term of probation.  It follows that the mandatory minimum sentence required by the drug proviso is a probation term equal to one-third the length of the original term of probation.  Given that Congress did not eliminate the possibility of incarceration (for example, by drafting the proviso to require a \"sentence of probation\"), the proviso gives the district court the discretion to impose any prison term otherwise available under the other portions of § 3565(a), which is more severe than the mandatory minimum sentence of probation.\\n\\nII\\n\\n61\\nIt is unfortunate that Congress has drafted a criminal statute that is far from transparent;  more unfortunate that the Court has interpreted it to require imprisonment when the text and structure call for a different result;  but most unfortunate that the Court has chosen such a questionable path to reach its destination.  I speak of the Court\\'s speculation that Congress drafted the § 3565(a) drug proviso with the pre-1984 federal sentencing regime in mind.  See ante, at ____.  Reading the proviso to require Granderson to serve a 2-month mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment, the Court reasons, \"would fit the [pre-1984] scheme precisely.\"  Id., at ----.  And viewing the proviso in that light, the Court adds, would avoid problems with both Granderson\\'s and the Government\\'s interpretations.  See ibid. Although the Court purports not to place much reliance upon this venture in interpretive archaeology, its extended discussion of the matter suggests otherwise.\\n\\n\\n62\\nThis interpretive technique, were it to take hold, would be quite a novel addition to the traditional rules that govern our interpretation of criminal statutes.  Some members of the Court believe that courts may look to \"the language and structure, legislative history, and motivating policies\" when reading a criminal statute in a manner adverse to a criminal defendant.  See United States v. R.L.C., 503 U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 1329, 1331, 117 L.Ed.2d 559 (1992) (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Others would eschew reliance upon legislative history and nebulous motivating policies when construing criminal statutes.  See id., at ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1333 (SCALIA, J., concurring).  But, to my knowledge, none of us has ever relied upon some vague intuition of what Congress \"might . . . have had in mind\" (ante, at ____) when drafting a criminal law.  And I am certain that we have not read a criminal statute against a criminal defendant by attributing to Congress a mindset that reflects a statutory framework that Congress itself had discarded over four years earlier.\\n\\n\\n63\\nOf course, the Court thinks it has done Granderson and probationers like him a great favor with its guesswork:  Assuming that the drug proviso mandates incarceration, the Court\\'s intuitions lead it to conclude that the mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment here is 2, rather than 20, months.  But in its rush to achieve what it views as justice in this case, the Court has missed a broader point:  The statute, by word and design, does not mandate a punishment of imprisonment on revocation.  In my respectful submission, had the Court adhered to the text and structure of the statute Congress enacted and the President signed, rather than given effect to its own intuitions of what might have been on Congress\\' mind at the time, it would have come to a different conclusion.  See Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 1998, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993).  And the fortuity that Granderson himself does not contend that the proviso permits a revocation sentence of probation, see ante, at ____, n. 12, is no reason to overlook that option here, given that our interpretation of the statute binds all probationers, not just Granderson.  Cf. Elder v. Holloway, --- U.S. ----, ----, and n. 3, 114 S.Ct. 1019, 1022-1023, and n. 3, --- L.Ed.2d ---- (1994).\\n\\n\\n64\\nPerhaps the result the Court reaches today may be sensible as a matter of policy, and may even reflect what some in Congress hoped to accomplish.  That result, however, does not accord with the text of the statute Congress saw fit to enact.  Put in simple terms, if indeed Congress intended to require the mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment the Court surmises, Congress fired a blank.  See Puerto Rico Dept. of Consumer Affairs v. Isla Petroleum Corp., 485 U.S. 495, 501, 108 S.Ct. 1350, 1354, 99 L.Ed.2d 582 (1988) (\"[U]nenacted approvals, beliefs, and desires are not laws\").  It is beyond our province to rescue Congress from its drafting errors, and to provide for what we might think, perhaps along with some members of Congress, is the preferred result.  See Smith v. United States, 508 U.S. ----, ----, n. 4, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 2063, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993) (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (\"Stretching language in order to write a more effective statute than Congress devised is not an exercise we should indulge in\");  Pavelic & LeFlore v. Marvel Entertainment Group, 493 U.S. 120, 126, 110 S.Ct. 456, 460, 107 L.Ed.2d 438 (1989) (\"Our task is to apply the text, not to improve upon it\"); United States v. Locke, 471 U.S. 84, 95, 105 S.Ct. 1785, 1793, 85 L.Ed.2d 64 (1985) (\"[T]he fact that Congress might have acted with greater clarity or foresight does not give courts a carte blanche to redraft statutes in an effort to achieve that which Congress is perceived to have failed to do\").  This admonition takes on a particular importance when the Court construes criminal laws.  \"[B]ecause of the seriousness of criminal penalties, and because criminal punishment usually represents the moral condemnation of the community, legislatures and not courts should define criminal activity,\" United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 348, 92 S.Ct. 515, 523, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971), and set the punishments therefor, see Bifulco v. United States, 447 U.S. 381, 100 S.Ct. 2247, 65 L.Ed.2d 205 (1980).\\n\\n\\n65\\nUnder any of the three interpretations set forth in the opinions filed today, there are bound to be cases where the mandatory sentence will make little sense or appear anomalous when compared with sentences imposed in similar cases.  Some incongruities, however, are inherent in any statute providing for mandatory minimum sentences.\\n\\n\\n66\\nIn my view, it is not necessary to invoke the rule of lenity here, for the text and structure of the statute yield but one proper answer.  But assuming, as the Court does, that the rule comes into play, I would have thought that it demands the interpretation set forth above.  For these reasons, I concur only in the judgment.\\n\\n\\n67\\nChief Justice REHNQUIST, with whom Justice THOMAS joins, dissenting.\\n\\n\\n68\\nThe Court today interprets the term \"original sentence,\" as it appears in 18 U.S.C. § 3565(a), to mean \"the maximum sentence, under the relevant Sentencing Guidelines range, which a defendant could have received, but did not, when initially sentenced.\"  I think this interpretation ignores the most natural meaning of these two words, and I therefore dissent.\\n\\n\\n69\\nSection 3565(a) does not indicate on its face whether a defendant found in violation of probation must be sentenced to prison or resentenced to another term of probation.  I agree with the Court that § 3565(a) must be read to require imposition of a term of imprisonment;  otherwise, as the Court explains, the proviso would be senseless.1  See ante, at 1263-1264;  In re Chapman, 166 U.S. 661, 667, 17 S.Ct. 677, 680, 41 L.Ed. 1154 (1897) (\"nothing is better settled than that statutes should receive a sensible construction, such as will effectuate the legislative intention, and, if possible, so as to avoid an unjust or an absurd conclusion\").  If the Court had stopped there, I would have been happy to join its opinion.  Having correctly resolved one ambiguity in § 3565(a), however, the Court proceeds to find another, regarding the meaning of the term \"original sentence,\" where none exists.  The Court thus ultimately concludes, incorrectly in my view, that the rule of lenity should be applied.\\n\\n\\n70\\nThe Court believes that the Government\\'s reading of § 3565(a) is not \"unambiguously correct.\"  Ante, at ----.  As we have explained, however, the rule of lenity should not be applied \"merely because it [is] possible to articulate a construction more narrow than that urged by the Government.\"  Moskal v. United States, 498 U.S. 103, 108, 111 S.Ct. 461, 465, 112 L.Ed.2d 449 (1990).  Instead we have reserved lenity for those situations where, after \"[a]pplying well-established principles of statutory construction,\" Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U.S. 395, 410, 111 S.Ct. 840, 849, 112 L.Ed.2d 919 (1991), there still remains \"a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the language and structure of the Act,\" Chapman v. United States, 500 U.S. 453, 463, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 1926, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\\n\\n\\n71\\nThe term \"original sentence\" is not defined in the statute. A basic principle of statutory construction provides that where words in a statute are not defined, they \"must be given their ordinary meaning.\"  Id., at 462, 111 S.Ct., at 1925-1926;  see also Smith v. United States, 507 U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 2054, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993) (\"When a word is not defined by statute, we normally construe it in accord with its ordinary or natural meaning\").\\n\\n\\n72\\nWhether one consults a dictionary or common sense, the meaning of \"original sentence\" is plain:  The term refers to the initial judgment imposing punishment on a defendant.  \"Original\" is commonly understood to mean \"initial\" or \"first in order.\"  See Webster\\'s Third New International Dictionary 1592 (1971) (Webster\\'s) (defining \"original\" as \"of or relating to a rise or beginning . . . initial, primary\");  Black\\'s Law Dictionary 1099 (6th ed. 1990) (defining original as \"[p]rimitive\" or \"first in order\").  \"Sentence,\" in turn, is ordinarily meant in the context of criminal law to refer to the judgment or order \"by which a court or judge imposes punishment or penalty upon a person found guilty.\"  Webster\\'s 2068;  see also Black\\'s Law Dictionary, supra, at 1362 (defining \"sentence\" as \"[t]he judgment . . . imposing the punishment to be inflicted, usually in the form of a fine, incarceration, or probation\").2  In the context of § 3565(a), the term \"original sentence\" thus must refer to the sentence of probation a defendant actually received when initially sentenced. It cannot, therefore, mean what the Court says it means:  the maximum sentence which a defendant could have received, but did not.\\n\\n\\n73\\nThe Court\\'s interpretation thus founders, I believe, because the word \"sentence\" does not ordinarily, or even occasionally, refer to a range of available punishment.  Nor does the modifying word \"original\" support the Court\\'s interpretation, because \"original\" is nowhere defined as \"potential\" or \"available,\" nor can it be so construed.  Yet under the Court\\'s interpretation of the term \"original sentence,\" if we know that \"sentence\" itself does not mean an available range of punishment, then \"original\" must be twisted to mean what we know it cannot—i.e., \"potential\" or \"available.\"3\\n\\n\\n74\\nThis Court has on many occasions demonstrated its clear understanding of the term \"original sentence.\"  See, e.g., Hicks v. Feiock, 485 U.S. 624, 639, and n. 11, 108 S.Ct. 1423, 1433, and n. 11, 99 L.Ed.2d 721 (1988) (using term \"original sentence\" to refer to sentence of imprisonment initially imposed and suspended);  Tuten v. United States, 460 U.S. 660, 666-667, and n. 11, 103 S.Ct. 1412, 1416, and n. 11, 75 L.Ed.2d 359 (1983) (using term \"original sentence\" to refer to period of probation imposed by sentencing court when youthful defendant was initially sentenced);  United States v. DiFrancesco, 449 U.S. 117, 135, 101 S.Ct. 426, 436, 66 L.Ed.2d 328 (1980), and id., at 148, 101 S.Ct., at 443 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (both using term \"original sentence\" to refer to sentence imposed upon defendant at conclusion of first trial);  North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 713, and n. 1, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 2074, and n. 1, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969), and id., at 743, 89 S.Ct., at 2084 (Black, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (same);  Pennsylvania ex rel. Sullivan v. Ashe, 302 U.S. 51, 53, 58 S.Ct. 59, 59-60, 82 L.Ed. 43 (1937) (same).  As these and numerous other opinions show,4 we have until today invariably used \"original sentence\" just as one would expect:  to refer to the punishment imposed upon a defendant when he was first sentenced, and to distinguish that initial sentence from a sentence the defendant received after some intervening event—such as a new trial, see Pearce, supra, or a revocation of probation, see Hicks, supra.5\\n\\n\\n75\\nThe Court\\'s heretofore firm grasp on the meaning of \"original sentence\" should not be cause for wonder or surprise.  Whether alone or in combination, the definitions of \"original\" and \"sentence\" simply do not seem open to serious debate.  Once the term \"original sentence\" is accorded its ordinary meaning, the operation of § 3565(a) becomes perfectly clear.6  It follows, from another elementary canon of construction, that the plain language of § 3565(a) should control.  See Moskal, 498 U.S., at 108, 111 S.Ct., at 465.  As we stated in Consumer Product Safety Comm\\'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980), \"[a]bsent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, [the statutory] language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.\"7\\n\\n\\n76\\nThe Court offers several reasons for rejecting the most natural reading of § 3565(a).  None of them persuades.  The Court begins by suggesting that if Congress meant for the sentence of probation to be used to calculate the length of incarceration, it could have stated so more clearly.  See ante, at ____.  Although perhaps true, Congress could have just as easily, if it wished, stated in clear terms that the sentence of incarceration should be calculated based on the maximum available sentence under the Guidelines range.  Indeed, as I have already noted, ante, at ____, n. 3, Congress stated something very similar in the subsections preceding and following the one at issue, where it provided that upon revocation of probation, a court can or must impose any sentence that was \"available\" when the defendant was initially sentenced.  See §§ 3565(a)(2) and (b);  United States v. Sosa, 997 F.2d 1130, 1133 (CA5 1993);  United States v. Byrkett, 961 F.2d 1399, 1400-1401 (CA8 1992) (\"If Congress, in referring to the \\'original sentence,\\' meant the Guidelines range applicable at the time of the initial sentencing, it would have simply said, \\'any other sentence that was available . . . at the time of the initial sentencing,\\' as it did\" in §§ 3565(a)(2) and (b)).\\n\\n\\n77\\nThe Court also asserts that its reading of the term avoids according two different meanings to the word \"sentence.\"  Yet under the Court\\'s own interpretation, the word \"sentence\" when used as a verb refers to the imposition of a fixed period of incarceration;  but when the word \"sentence\" next appears, as a noun, the Court concludes that it refers to a range of available punishment.  Thus it is the Court\\'s reading of the statute that fails \" \\'to give . . . a similar construction\\' \" to a word used as both a noun and a verb in a single statutory sentence.  See ante, at ____ (quoting Reves, 507 U.S., at ----, 113 S.Ct., at 1169). Under what I think is the correct reading of the statute, all that changes is what the defendant will be (or was) sentenced to—prison or probation;  the word \"sentence\" itself does not change meanings.\\n\\n\\n78\\nThe Court next contends that \" \\'[p]robation and imprisonment are not fungible,\\' \" ante, at ---- (citation omitted), and that its interpretation of the statute avoids the \"shoal\" supposedly encountered when explaining \"how multiplying a sentence of probation by one-third can yield a sentence of imprisonment,\" ante, at ____.  Probation and imprisonment, however, need not be fungible for this statute to make sense.  They need only both be subsumed under the term \"sentence,\" which, for the reasons previously stated, they are.  See Black\\'s Law Dictionary 1362 (6th ed. 1990) (defining sentence as a judgment imposing punishment, which may include \"a fine, incarceration, or probation\").  While tying the length of imprisonment to the length of the original sentence of probation might seem harsh to the Court, surely it is not an irrational method of calculation.  Indeed, the Court does not question that Congress could have tied the length of imprisonment to the length of the original sentence of probation.\\n\\n\\n79\\nCongress in fact prescribed a similar method of calculation in a parallel provision of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3583(g), which was added at the same time as § 3565(a) and which also sets out the punishment for defendants found in possession of a controlled substance.  Section 3583(g) explicitly provides:  \"If the defendant is found by the court to be in the possession of a controlled substance, the court shall terminate the term of supervised release and require the defendant to serve in prison not less than one-third of the term of supervised release.\" Considering that §§ 3565(a) and 3583(g) were enacted at the same time and are directed at precisely the same problem, it seems quite reasonable to construe them in pari materia to call for parallel treatment of drug offenders under non-custodial supervision.  Whatever the differences between supervised release and probation, surely supervised release is more like probation than it is like imprisonment.  That Congress explicitly chose in § 3583(g) to tie the length of imprisonment to the length of supervised release suggests quite strongly that Congress meant in § 3565(a) to use length of the original sentence of probation as the basis for calculation.  At the very least, the method of calculation prescribed in § 3583(g) removes the imaginary \"shoal\" which blocks the Court\\'s way to a sensible construction of § 3565(a).\\n\\n\\n80\\nThe Court refuses to read these provisions in pari materia because a sentence of probation is normally—but not necessarily longer than a period of supervised release.  See ante, at ____, and n. 8.  Simply because the end result of the calculation might be different in some cases, however, is not a persuasive reason for refusing to recognize the obvious similarity in the methods of calculation.  Nor is it irrational for Congress to have decided that, in general, those defendants who have already been incarcerated should return to prison for a shorter time than those who have served no time in prison.\\n\\n\\n81\\nHere, as in other portions of its opinion, the Court expresses concern with the apparent harshness of the result if \"original sentence\" is interpreted to mean the sentence of probation initially imposed on a defendant.8  In some cases the result may indeed appear harsh.  Yet harsh punishment, in itself, is neither a legitimate ground for invalidating a statute nor cause for injecting ambiguity into a statute that is susceptible to principled statutory construction.  See Callanan v. United States, 364 U.S. 587, 596, 81 S.Ct. 321, 326, 5 L.Ed.2d 312 (1961) (\"The rule [of lenity] comes into operation at the end of the process of construing what Congress has expressed, not at the beginning as an overriding consideration of being lenient to wrongdoers\").  A straightforward reading of § 3565(a) may in some cases call for imposition of severe punishment, but it does not produce \"a result so absurd or glaringly unjust, as to raise a reasonable doubt about Congress\\' intent.\"  Chapman, 500 U.S., at 463-464, 111 S.Ct., at 1922 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\\n\\n\\n82\\nThe Court\\'s interpretation of § 3565(a), finally, creates an incurable uncertainty:  It offers no sound basis for choosing which point in the Guidelines range should serve as the basis for calculating a revocation sentence.  After describing the four possible reference points within the range, the Court selects the maximum available sentence.  It rejects selecting a point in the middle of the available range, because to do so \"would be purely arbitrary.\"  Ante, at ____.  Yet the Court does not explain why choosing the top end of the range is any less arbitrary, or any more \"sensible,\" than picking a point in the middle of the range. Indeed, the Court\\'s selection smacks of awarding a consolation prize to the Government simply out of concern that the Government was mistakenly done out of victory in the main event.  And choosing the maximum possible sentence under the Guidelines hardly seems consistent with the rule of lenity which the Court purports to apply.9\\n\\n\\n83\\nA straightforward reading of § 3565(a) creates no similar uncertainty.  Because I think the language of § 3565(a) is clear, I would apply it.  Accordingly, I would reverse the Court of Appeals.\\n\\n\\n\\n*\\n The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.

Corpuz, 953 F.2d 526 (CA9 1992) (all reading \"original sentence\" to refer to the term of the revoked probation).\\n\\n\\n2\\n The interpretation offered by Justice KENNEDY—a reduced sentence of probation as the mandatory minimum—is notable for its originality.  No court that has essayed construction of the prescription at issue has come upon the answer Justice KENNEDY finds clear in \"the text and structure of the statute.\"  Post, at ____.  But cf. id., at 1274 (describing the statute as \"far from transparent\").\\n\\n\\n3\\n The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, for the first time, classified probation as a sentence;  before 1984, probation had been considered an alternative to a sentence.  See S.Rep. No. 98-225, p. 88 (1983), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1984, p. 3182.\\n\\n\\n4\\n Justice KENNEDY\\'s novel interpretation would authorize revocation sentences under which drug possessors could profit from their violations.  The present case is an example.  The District Court determined, just over four months into Granderson\\'s 60-month sentence of probation, that Granderson had violated his conditions of probation by possessing drugs.  If Justice KENNEDY were correct that the proviso allows a revocation sentence of probation, one-third as long as the sentence of probation originally imposed, then the District Court could have \"punished\" Granderson for his cocaine possession by reducing his period of probation from 60 months to just over 24 months.  Justice KENNEDY\\'s interpretation would present a similar anomaly whenever the drug-possessing probationer has served less than two-thirds of the sentence of probation initially imposed.  Surely such an interpretation is implausible.\\n\\n\\n5\\n The dissent notes that the term \"original sentence\" has been used in a number of this Court\\'s opinions and in other statutes and rules, in each instance to refer to a sentence actually imposed.  See post, at ____, and nn. 4-5.  None of those cases, statutes or rules, however, involves an interpretive problem such as the one presented here, where, if the \"original sentence\" is the sentence actually imposed, a \"plain meaning\" interpretation of the proviso leads to an absurd result.  See supra, at ____, and n. 4.\\nThe dissent observes, further, that other federal sentencing provisions \"use the word \\'sentence\\' to refer to the punishment actually imposed on a defendant.\"  Post, at ____, n. 2.  In each of the cited instances, however, this reference is made clear by context, either by specifying the type of sentence (e.g., \"sentence to pay a fine,\" \"sentence to probation,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3551(c)), or by using a variant of the phrase \"impose sentence\" (see §§ 3553(a), (b), (c), (e);  3554-3558).\\n\\n\\n6\\n At a revocation hearing, in contrast to a full-scale criminal trial, the matter is tried to the court rather than a jury;  also, the standard of proof has been held to be less stringent than the reasonable doubt standard applicable to criminal prosecutions.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3565(a);  Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 32.1;  United States v. Gordon, 961 F.2d 426, 429 (CA3 1992) (citing cases).\\n\\n\\n7\\n The dissent suggests that the statutory maximum for the original offense (five years in this case, see 18 U.S.C. § 1703(a)) is the maximum revocation sentence.  See post, at ____, n. 8.  The District Court, however, could not have imposed this sentence originally, without providing \"the specific reason\" for departing from the Guidelines range, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(c), and explaining in particular why \"an aggravating . . . circumstance exists that was not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines. . . .\"  § 3553(b).  Upward departures from the presumptive Guidelines range to the statutory maximum are thus appropriate only in exceptional cases.  See infra, at ____, n. 14.  The dissent\\'s interpretation, however, would allow district courts to impose the statutory maximum as a revocation sentence in the routine exercise of their ordinary discretion.\\n\\n\\n8\\n A probation term of 1-5 years is available for Class C and D felonies;  the corresponding term of supervised release is not more than 3 years.  For Class E felonies, a 1-5 year probation term is available, but not more than a 1-year term of supervised release.  For misdemeanors, a probation term of not more than 5 years is available;  the corresponding term of supervised release is not more than 1 year. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 3561(b), 3583(b).\\n\\n\\n9\\n Debate over the conference bill took place in the middle of the night, see 134 Cong.Rec. 32633 (1988) (\"I am cognizant that it is 2:20 in the morning, and I will not take long\") (remarks of Sen. Dole);  id., at 33318 (House vote taken at 1 a.m.), with Congress anxious to adjourn and return home for the 1988 elections that were little more than two weeks away.  Section-by-section analyses were produced after conference in both the Senate and the House, but neither publication casts much light on the proviso. See id., at 32707 (1988) (Senate);  id., at 33236 (1988) (House).\\n\\n\\n10\\n See Cunningham, Levi, Green, & Kaplan, Plain Meaning and Hard Cases, 103 Yale L.J. ----, ---- - ---- (1994) (forthcoming).\\n\\n\\n11\\n The chief difficulty with such an interpretation is that pre-1984 law recognized two kinds of suspended sentences, each of which could lead to probation.  While suspension of the execution of sentence, as mentioned, neatly fits Granderson\\'s theory, suspension of the imposition of sentence fits the theory less well:  In that situation, no determinate \"original sentence\" would be at hand for precise calculation of the revocation sentence.\\n\\n\\n12\\n Justice KENNEDY suggests that our interpretation of the proviso \"read[s] a criminal statute against a criminal defendant,\" post, at ____, and that to the extent the rule of lenity is applicable, it would \"deman[d] the interpretation\" advanced in his opinion—that the proviso establishes a mandatory minimum sentence of probation, one-third as long as the sentence of probation initially imposed.  Post, at ____.  We note that Granderson, the criminal defendant in this case, does not urge the interpretation Justice KENNEDY presents.  More to the point, both of Justice KENNEDY\\'s assertions presuppose that his interpretation of the proviso is a permissible one.  For reasons set out above, we think it is not.  See supra, at ____, and n. 4.\\nJustice SCALIA suggests that on our interpretation of the proviso, the mandatory minimum revocation sentence should include a fine as well as a term of imprisonment.  See post, at ____.  The term of probation, however, was imposed in lieu of a sentence of imprisonment, not in lieu of a fine.  Revocation of the sentence of probation, we think, implies replacing the sentence of probation with a sentence of imprisonment, but does not require changing an unrevoked sentence earlier imposed.\\n\\n\\n13\\n See United States v. Penn, 17 F.3d 70 (CA4 1994) (expressly declaring that the minimum revocation sentence is one-third of the top of the Guidelines range);  United States v. Alese, 6 F.3d 85 (CA2 1993) (per curiam ) (same);  United States v. Gordon, 961 F.2d 426 (CA3 1992) (same);  United States v. Clay, 982 F.2d 959 (CA6 1993) (holding that the maximum revocation sentence is the top of the Guidelines range), cert. pending, No. 93-52;  United States v. Diaz, 989 F.2d 391 (CA10 1993) (vacating a revocation sentence that exceeded the top of the original Guidelines range).  The Court of Appeals in the present case was not required to identify the minimum term, because Granderson had served 5 months more than the top of the Guidelines range by the time the opinion was issued.  See United States v. Granderson, 969 F.2d 980, 985 (CA11 1992).\\n\\n\\n14\\n The Government observes that \"in appropriate circumstances\" the sentencing court may depart upward from the presumptive Guidelines range, limited in principle only by the statutory maximum.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b).  According to the Government, it follows that if the \"original sentence\" is the \"maximum available sentence,\" then the statutory maximum rather than the top of the presumptive Guidelines range is the appropriate basis for the revocation sentence.  Brief for United States 22.  The short answer to the Government\\'s argument is that for cases in which the sentencing judge considers an upward departure warranted, a sentence of probation, rather than one of imprisonment, is a most unlikely prospect.  It makes scant sense, then, to assume that an \"original sentence\" for purposes of probation revocation is a sentence beyond the presumptively applicable Guidelines range.\\n\\n\\n15\\n At oral argument the Government suggested that its own interpretation is more lenient than Granderson\\'s, in those rare cases in which the court has departed downward from the Guidelines to impose a sentence of probation.  In United States v. Harrison, 815 F.Supp. 494 (DC 1993), for example, the court, on the government\\'s motion, had departed downward from a 97-121 month Guidelines range and a 10-year statutory mandatory minimum to impose only a sentence of probation.  When the Government moved to revoke probation for drug possession, the court held that the statute required basing the revocation sentence upon the term of probation rather than the Guidelines range, and, in the alternative, that even if the statute were ambiguous, the rule of lenity would so require.  Having found § 3565(a)\\'s drug possession proviso ambiguous, we agree that the rule of lenity would support a shorter sentence, whether on Harrison\\'s analysis, or on the theory that the \"applicable Guidelines range\" is the maximum of a Guidelines range permitting a sentence of probation.\\n\\n\\n*\\n The Court\\'s reply to this is that since \"[t]he term of probation . . . was imposed in lieu of a sentence of imprisonment, not in lieu of a fine,\" its revocation \"implies replacing the sentence of probation with a sentence of imprisonment.\"  Ante, at ____, n. 12.  I do not know why an implication would inhere in the proviso which contradicts the body of § 3565(a)(2) to which the proviso is attached.  The latter provides that the court may \"revoke the sentence of probation and impose any other sentence that was available . . . at the time of the initial sentencing\" (emphasis added).  Presumably the Court would concede that \"any other sentence\" includes a fine—in which case its discernment of some implication that revoked probation may be replaced by only prison time must be wrong.\\nJustice KENNEDY makes a similar defense.  He refuses to consider the fine component because \"[t]he proviso instructs the district court to \\'revoke the sentence of probation,\\' but says nothing about the fine imposed at the original sentencing,\" post, at ____.  There is, however, clearly no requirement that only what has been revoked can be the baseline for measuring the requisite minimum—for even the un revoked (because already served) portion of the probation period counts.  Justice KENNEDY\\'s argument reduces, therefore, to the contention that for some unexplained reason the requisite minimum replacement for the revoked \"probation component\" of the original sentence can be measured only by that same component.  This imperative is not to be found in the language of the statute;  to the contrary, interchangeability of fines and probation is suggested by the body of § 3565(a)(2) quoted above.  Here, it seems to me, Justice KENNEDY simply abandons the text and adopts an intuited limitation remarkably similar to those for which he criticizes the Court and the dissent.\\n\\n\\n1\\n The option of imposing a fine after revocation is also foreclosed.  As a matter of common usage, the prepositional phrase following a noun need not be repeated when the noun appears again in the same sentence.  Thus, § 3565(a) reads:  \"the court shall revoke the sentence of probation and sentence the defendant to not less than one-third of the original sentence [of probation ].\" (Emphasis added).  \"[N]ot less than one-third\" of a term of probation is a period of time.  A fine cannot follow revocation, then, because a fine is measured in money, not time.\\n\\n\\n2\\n Federal sentencing law also consistently uses the word \"sentence\" to refer to the punishment actually imposed on a defendant.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 3551(b) and (c), 3553(a), (b), (c), and (e), and 3554-3558.\\n\\n\\n3\\n Congress itself, in the subsections preceding and following the provision at issue here, distinguishes between \"original\" and \"available.\"  Sections 3565(a)(2) and (b) provide that under certain circumstances, a court can or must \"revoke the sentence of probation and impose any other sentence that was available . . . at the time of the initial sentencing.\" (Emphasis added).  If \"original\" and \"available\" were in fact synonymous, or if \"sentence\" could mean an available range of punishment, Congress could have simply stated in §§ 3565(a)(2) and (b) that upon revocation of probation, a court can or must \"impose the original sentence.\"  See United States v. Sosa, 997 F.2d 1130, 1133 (CA5 1993) (\"The statute taken as a whole demonstrates that Congress knew how to refer to the sentence the defendant could have received at the time of the initial sentencing.  Instead, . . . Congress used the term \\'original sentence,\\' which plainly refers to the sentence imposed on the defendant for his original crime\").\\n\\n\\n4\\n The term \"original sentence\" appears in at least 50 prior opinions.  Rather than citing them all, suffice it to say that a review of these opinions reveals that the term is not once used to refer to the range of punishment potentially applicable when a defendant was first sentenced.\\n\\n\\n5\\n Although the term \"original sentence\" does not appear in other provisions of the Federal Criminal Code chapter on sentencing, it does appear in other federal statutes and rules. In each instance, the term refers to the sentence initially imposed upon a defendant.  See, e.g., Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 35(a)(2) (directing sentencing courts to correct sentences upon remand from a Court of Appeals if, after further sentencing proceedings, \"the court determines that the original sentence was incorrect\");  10 U.S.C. § 863 (providing that upon rehearing in a court-martial, \"no sentence in excess of or more severe than the original sentence may be imposed\").  The term is similarly used in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.  See, e.g., United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual § 4A1.2(k) (Nov. 1993) (using term \"original sentence\" to refer to sentence previously imposed upon defendant);  § 7B1.4, comment., n. 4 (same).\\n\\n\\n6\\n The Court suggests that if \"original sentence\" is given its ordinary meaning, the statute will have to be interpreted to require the absurd result that a revocation sentence be another term of probation.  See ante, at ____, n. 5.  I do not see at all how or why the latter proposition follows from the former.  The Court rightly rejects interpreting the statute to require reimposition of probation because that would be a senseless reading, and it would be senseless regardless of what the term \"original sentence\" means.  See ante, at ____.  It is thus beyond me why the Court seems to think that according the term \"original sentence\" its most natural reading would require it to readopt a reading of the statute that it justifiably discarded as senseless.\\n\\n\\n7\\n The Court suggests that the legislative history of § 3565(a) casts doubt upon the Government\\'s interpretation.  Yet even the Court recognizes that the legislative history is, at best, inconclusive.  See ante, at ____ (\"None of the legislators\\' expressions . . . focuses on \\'the precise meaning of the provision at issue in this case\\' \") (quoting Brief for United States 24, and n. 4);  see also ante, at ____, and n. 11.  Where the language of a statute is clear, that language, rather than \"isolated excerpts from the legislative history,\" should be followed.  Patterson v. Shumate, 504 U.S. ----, ----, and n. 4, 112 S.Ct. 2242, 2248, and n. 4, 119 L.Ed.2d 519 (1992).\\n\\n\\n8\\n The Court expresses disbelief that Congress could have intended to authorize punishment for drug-possessing probationers so much more severe than the punishment authorized for the probationer\\'s original offense.  Ante, at ____.  I think the Court misses two points.  First, as the Court itself seems to recognize, the maximum punishment authorized for respondent\\'s original offense is not the Guidelines range, but the maximum statutory sentence.  See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1703(a), 3553(b), 3559(a)(4), and 3581(b)(4).  In respondent\\'s case, the punishment authorized for his original offense is therefore exactly equal to the punishment authorized for his probation violation—five years\\' imprisonment. See § 1703(a).  Second, Congress provided for equally harsh revocation sentences in the subsections preceding and following § 3565(a).  By allowing sentencing courts to impose \"any other sentence that was available . . . at the time of the initial sentencing,\" §§ 3565(a)(2) and (b), Congress authorized these courts to impose the maximum statutory sentence upon revocation of probation.  Thus, if respondent\\'s probation had been revoked pursuant to §§ 3565(a)(2) or (b), he would have faced the same maximum revocation sentence he faces under § 3565(a)—five years\\' imprisonment.\\n\\n\\n9\\n The Government suggests that if \"original sentence\" does not refer to the sentence of probation imposed, then it might just as readily refer to the statutory sentence.  The Court rejects this suggestion because imposing the maximum statutory sentence would require an upward departure from the Guidelines range, and probation \"is a most unlikely prospect\" in any case involving an upward departure.  Ante, at ____, n. 14.  Thus, according to the Court, it \"makes scant sense\" to assume that \"original sentence\" is the statutory maximum sentence.  Ante, at ____, n. 14.  By the same reasoning, however, it makes little sense to assume that the maximum Guidelines sentence is the \"original sentence,\" as probation is an \"unlikely prospect\" in any case where a defendant would otherwise receive the maximum available sentence under the Guidelines.  Indeed, if the plausibility of the potential sentence is the Court\\'s guide, one would think the Court would choose the bottom of the Guidelines range as its benchmark.\\n\\n\\n'}]\n",

      "[{'11 U.S. 32': '11 U.S. 32\\n7 Cranch 32\\n3 L.Ed. 259\\nTHE UNITED STATESv.HUDSON AND GOODWIN\\nFebruary 13, 1812\\n\\nAbsent. Washington, justice.\\nTHIS was a case certified from the Circuit Court for the District of Connecticut, in which, upon argument of a general demurrer to an indictment for a libel on the President and Congress of the United States, contained in the Connecticut Currant, of the 7th of May, 1806, charging them with having in secret voted two millions of dollars as a present to Bonaparte for leave to make a treaty with Spain, the judges of that Court were divided in opinion upon the question, whether the Circuit Court of the United States had a common law jurisdiction in cases of libel.\\nPINKNEY, Attorney General, in behalf of the United States, and DANA for the Defendants, declined arguing the case.\\nThe Court, having taken time to consider, the following opinion was delivered (on the last day of the term, all the judges being present) by JOHNSON, J.\\n\\n\\n1\\nThe only question which this case presents is, whether the Circuit Courts of the United States can exercise a common law jurisdiction in criminal cases. We state it thus broadly because a decision on a case of libel will apply to every case in which jurisdiction is not vested in those Courts by statute.\\n\\n\\n2\\nAlthough this question is brought up now for the first time to be decided by this Court, we consider it as having been long since settled in public opinion. In no other case for many years has this jurisdiction been asserted; and the general acquiescence of legal men shews the prevalence of opinion in favor of the negative of the proposition.\\n\\n\\n3\\nThe course of reasoning which leads to this conclusion is simple, obvious, and admits of but little illustration. The powers of the general Government are made up of concessions from the several states—whatever is not expressly given to the former, the latter expressly reserve. The judicial power of the United States is a constituent part of those concessions,—that power is to be exercised by Courts organized for the purpose, and brought into existence by an effort of the legislative power of the Union. Of all the Courts which the United States may, under their general powers, constitute, one only, the Supreme Court, possesses jurisdiction derived immediately from the constitution, and of which the legislative power cannot deprive it. All other Courts created by the general Government possess no jurisdiction but what is given them by the power that creates them, and can be vested with none but what the power ceded to the general Government will authorize them to confer.\\n\\n\\n4\\nIt is not necessary to inquire whether the general Government, in any and what extent, possesses the power of conferring on its Courts a jurisdiction in cases similar to the present; it is enough that such jurisdiction has not been conferred by any legislative act, if it does not result to those Courts as a consequence of their creation.\\n\\n\\n5\\nAnd such is the opinion of the majority of this Court: For, the power which congress possess to create Courts of inferior jurisdiction, necessarily implies the power to limit the jurisdiction of those Courts to particular objects; and when a Court is created, and its operations confined to certain specific objects, with what propriety can it assume to itself a jurisdiction—much more extended—in its nature very indefinite applicable to a great variety of subjects—varying in every state in the Union—and with regard to which there exists no definite criterion of distribution between the district and Circuit Courts of the same district?\\n\\n\\n6\\nThe only ground on which it has ever been contended that this jurisdiction could be maintained is, that, upon the formation of any political body, an implied power to preserve its own existence and promote the end and object of its creation, necessarily results to it. But, without examining how far this consideration is applicable to the peculiar character of our constitution, it may be remarked that it is a principle by no means peculiar to the common law. It is coeval, probably, with the first formation of a limited Government; belongs to a system of universal law, and may as well support the assumption of many other powers as those more peculiarly acknowledged by the common law of England.\\n\\n\\n7\\nBut if admitted as applicable to the state of things in this country, the consequence would not result from it which is here contended for. If it may communicate certain implied powers to the general Government, it would not follow that the Courts of that Government are vested with jurisdiction over any particular act done by an individual in supposed violation of the peace and dignity of the sovereign power. The legislative authority of the Union must first make an act a crime, affix a punishment to it, and declare the Court that shall have jurisdiction of the offence.\\n\\n\\n8\\nCertain implied powers must necessarily result to our Courts of justice from the nature of their institution. But jurisdiction of crimes against the state is not among those powers. To fine for contempt—imprison for contumacy—inforce the observance of order, &c. are powers which cannot be dispensed with in a Court, because they are necessary to the exercise of all others: and so far our Courts no doubt possess powers not immediately derived from statute; but all exercise of criminal jurisdiction in common law cases we are of opinion is not within their implied powers.\\n\\n'}]\n",

Hudspeth pled guilty to one count of unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g)(1).  The sentencing judge found that Hudspeth qualified for an enhancement of his sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e)(1), based on his criminal record.  The ACCA mandates a sentence of not less than fifteen years for a defendant with three prior convictions for violent felonies who is subsequently convicted for the unlawful possession of a firearm.  The court imposed a fifteen year sentence, which Hudspeth appeals on two grounds:  first, that he was improperly sentenced as an \"armed career criminal\" under the ACCA, and second, that the district court\\'s recalculation of his sentence violated the Double Jeopardy Clause.  We affirm.\\n\\nI.\\nBACKGROUND\\n\\n2\\nOn August 1, 1991, Hudspeth pled guilty to one count of unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.1  Prior to Hudspeth\\'s plea, the government advised him that it intended to seek the minimum fifteen year sentence enhancement2 authorized by the ACCA, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e)(1), which states:\\n\\n\\n3\\n\"In the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title and has three previous convictions by any court ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another, such person shall be fined not more than $25,000 and imprisoned not less than fifteen years.\"\\n\\n\\n4\\nHudspeth had three prior burglary convictions for crimes committed in Sangamon County, Illinois.  The district court reviewed the police reports from Hudspeth\\'s three prior burglaries,3 which described the following facts concerning Hudspeth\\'s 1983 state burglary convictions.4  On March 27, 1983, at about 7:15 p.m., Hudspeth and two others were observed at the Laketown Shopping Center, a strip mall in Springfield, Illinois.  Hudspeth was carrying a large canvas bag, which was later discovered to contain a sledge hammer, pry bars, chisels, a screwdriver, a pipe wrench, two police scanners, and a CB radio.  In approximately thirty-five minutes, the three men broke into and ransacked a doughnut shop, a dry cleaners, and an insurance company.  The burglars were apprehended during their attempt to enter a fourth business.5\\n\\n\\n5\\nThe district court found that Hudspeth\\'s three 1983 convictions for burglary were three \"separate crimes against separate victims in separate locations.\"   Thus the court concluded that Hudspeth\\'s burglaries were crimes \"committed on occasions different from one another\" and thus qualified Hudspeth for the minimum fifteen year sentence enhancement set by Sec. 924(e)(1).\\n\\nII.\\nDISCUSSION\\n\\n6\\nA. Sentence Enhancement Under the Armed Career Criminal Act\\n\\n\\n7\\n1. Crimes \"Committed on Occasions Different From One Another\"\\n\\n\\n8\\nUnder the ACCA, a thrice convicted felon, who is subsequently convicted for the unlawful possession of a firearm, is subject to a mandatory sentence of not less than fifteen years provided that the three prior convictions resulted from acts \"committed on occasions different from one another....\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e)(1).6  This Circuit and other Circuits have had numerous opportunities to interpret the phrase \"committed on occasions different from one another \" in situations like the present case where several crimes were committed in rapid succession.  This Circuit has joined nine other Circuits, including the First, Second, Third, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth and Eleventh, in holding that a defendant is subject to the sentence enhancement if each of the prior convictions arose out of a \"separate and distinct criminal episode.\"  United States v. Schieman, 894 F.2d 909, 911 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 856, 111 S.Ct. 155, 112 L.Ed.2d 121 (1990) (emphasis added);  see United States v.

Greene, 810 F.2d 999 (11th Cir.1986).\\n\\n\\n9\\nThis Circuit, when considering whether multiple convictions arose out of \"separate and distinct criminal episodes,\" has consistently looked to the nature of the crimes, the identities of the victims, and the locations.  In Schieman, the defendant committed a burglary;  three blocks away and ten minutes later he attacked and injured a police officer.  Schieman, 894 F.2d at 913.   Judge Bauer, writing for the court, ruled that Schieman\\'s actions constituted two separate \"occasions\" under the ACCA because he \" \\'committed separate crimes against separate victims in separate locations.\\' \"  Id. (quoting Towne, 870 F.2d at 881 (emphasis added).\\n\\n\\n10\\nWe followed the same reasoning in United States v. Godinez, 998 F.2d 471 (7th Cir.1993).  In Godinez, the defendant kidnapped a woman at 8:45 p.m. in order that he might use her car in a robbery.  He took the victim to his apartment where an accomplice kept watch over her.  The defendant then drove the victim\\'s car to a convenience store where he committed the robbery at 10:00 p.m.  He was arrested on the way back to his apartment.  Id. at 472.   In Godinez we held that even though the defendant admitted that he kidnapped the woman in order to use her car in the robbery, the kidnapping and robbery were two separate criminal aggressions against separate victims.  Id. at 472-73.\\n\\n\\n11\\nIn Godinez, we distinguished Schieman from Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970), in which the defendant (Ashe) committed multiple offenses on a single occasion (in the same location and at the same time) by \"robb[ing] six players at a poker game, committing at least six [simultaneous] crimes with the same [command of] \\'stick \\'em up\\'.\"  Godinez, 998 F.2d at 472.   Judge Easterbrook explained that\\n\\n\\n12\\n\"[o]rdering six poker players at the same game to empty their pockets is one criminal episode.  But one crime hard on the heels of another can be a \\'separate and distinct criminal episode\\', as Schieman itself shows.  Schieman committed a burglary.  Three blocks away he attacked and wounded a police officer.  This was a distinct transaction, we held, because the burglary was over....  Schieman could have committed either crime without the other;  a person willing to commit both is more dangerous than a person who confines himself to one.  That the two crimes were close in time did not matter, we concluded.\"\\n\\n\\n13\\nId. (emphasis added) (citations omitted).  Godinez concluded that \"the question is not whether one crime overlaps another but whether the crimes reflect distinct aggressions.\"  Id. at 473 (emphasis added);  see also United States v. Washington, 898 F.2d 439, 441-42 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 842, 111 S.Ct. 122, 112 L.Ed.2d 91 (1990) (successive robberies of the same store clerk at the same convenience store by the same defendant within two hours held to be separate criminal episodes);  Antonie, 953 F.2d at 499 (two armed robberies committed on the same evening approximately forty minutes apart held to be two separate predicate offenses).\\n\\n\\n14\\nIn United States v. Tisdale, 921 F.2d 1095 (10th Cir.1990), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 596, 116 L.Ed.2d 619 (1991), a case factually indistinguishable from the one before us, the Tenth Circuit held that a burglar who broke into three stores in a mall had committed the crimes on three separate \"occasions\" under the ACCA:\\n\\n\\n15\\n\"After the defendant \\'successfully completed\\' burglarizing one business, he was free to leave.  The fact that he chose, instead, to burglarize another business is evidence of his intent to engage in a separate criminal episode.  Moreover, unlike [United States v. Petty, 798 F.2d 1157 (8th Cir.1986), vacated, 481 U.S. 1034, [107 S.Ct. 1968, 95 L.Ed.2d 810], on remand, 828 F.2d 2 (8th Cir.1987) ], the defendant\\'s burglaries did not occur at the same location.  The record shows that although defendant entered one shopping mall he had to physically break [into] and enter three separate structures.   The fact each incident occurred inside one enclosed structure does not alter our conclusion that the crimes were committed at different locations.  Thus we find that the trial court properly enhanced the defendant\\'s penalty under Sec. 924(e)(1).\"\\n\\n\\n16\\nId. at 1099 (emphasis added).\\n\\n\\n17\\nCases interpreting the ACCA clearly uphold the minimum fifteen-year sentence enhancement for criminals who commit separate crimes against different individuals while on a spree, within a short period of time, provided that the perpetrator had the opportunity to cease and desist from his criminal actions at any time.  For instance, in United States v. Brady, 988 F.2d 664, 668-669 (6th Cir.)  (en banc), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 166, 126 L.Ed.2d 126 (1993), the Sixth Circuit held that two armed robberies committed against different victims at different locations within the span of forty-five minutes were separate criminal episodes.  The court in Brady defined a criminal episode as \"an incident that is part of a series, but forms a separate unit within the whole.  Although related to the entire course of events, an episode is a punctuated occurrence with a limited duration.\"  Id. (citing United States v. Hughes, 924 F.2d 1354, 1361 (6th Cir.1991)).  Under the ACCA, the relevant inquiry as to the timing of multiple crimes is simple:  were the crimes simultaneous or were they sequential?\\n\\n\\n18\\nHudspeth\\'s criminal history clearly makes him a proper subject for the sentence enhancement provision of the ACCA.7  Hudspeth committed three distinct burglaries against three separate victims (the owners of three distinct business enterprises), in three separate locations8 over the course of more than thirty minutes9--a greater period of time than the two crimes committed in Schieman (ten minutes).  Hudspeth\\'s three burglaries were sequential (committed in succession), and not simultaneous;  it is physically impossible for one person to commit three burglaries simultaneously at three different locations.  Because Hudspeth\\'s crimes were committed sequentially, against different victims, at different times, and at different locations, they were clearly crimes \"committed on occasions different from one another\" as required under the ACCA.  See Tisdale, 921 F.2d at 1099.\\n\\n\\n19\\nThe ACCA is directed at criminals who make a career out of criminal activity.  A defendant who has the opportunity to cease and desist or withdraw from his criminal activity at any time, but who chooses to commit additional crimes, deserves harsher punishment than the criminal who commits multiple crimes simultaneously.  An individual who commits simultaneous crimes (one single criminal action directed against a number of individuals), as did the defendant in Petty, has no opportunity to turn back and abandon his criminal conduct--the crime is completed with the single utterance of \"stick \\'em up.\"   See Godinez, 998 F.2d at 472.   The same is true of an individual who violates multiple criminal statutes by a single act.10  In contrast, a defendant who commits sequential crimes has the opportunity at each and every turn to withdraw from his criminal activity.\\n\\n\\n20\\nHudspeth, a professional burglar, came to the Laketown Shopping Center armed for each and every eventuality that might arise.  Hudspeth was observed carrying a bag, later found to contain a sledge hammer, pry bars, chisels, a screwdriver, a pipe wrench, two police scanners, and a CB radio.  Obviously he had cased the premises in advance for he knew precisely which tools were necessary to break into the individual business locations.  The record implies that the burglars first unlawfully pried open the rear door of the dry cleaners.11  At that point, the three men could have terminated their criminal endeavor, but they chose instead to commit a second burglary.  The burglars then used a sledge hammer to bust a hole through the shared wall between the dry cleaners and the doughnut shop.  Once again, Hudspeth could have aborted the criminal activity, but he decided instead to commit a third burglary.  One of the burglars then forced open the door connecting the doughnut shop and the insurance company.  Following this entry, the burglars attempted to enter a fourth business, but they were apprehended during their attempt.\\n\\n\\n21\\nEntry into each successive business reflected a clear and deliberate choice to commit a \"distinct aggression,\" Godinez, 998 F.2d at 473.   At any given point in time during his crime spree, Hudspeth was free to cease and desist from further criminal activity.  He instead chose to continue.  Because of his three decisions to enter each successive business, it is evident that he intended \"to engage in a separate criminal episode.\"  Tisdale, 921 F.2d at 1099;  see also Godinez 998 F.2d at 472 (\"one crime hard on the heels of another can be a \\'separate and distinct criminal episode\\', as Schieman itself shows\").12\\n\\n\\n22\\n2. The Legislative History of Sec. 924(e)(1)\\n\\n\\n23\\nAs an initial matter, we must state our disagreement with the use of legislative history to interpret unambiguous statutory language.  As a court of appeal, we may turn to the legislative history to interpret a statute only when the statute is ambiguous.  United States v. Shriver, 989 F.2d 898, 901 (7th Cir.1992);  see also United States v. Real Estate Known as 916 Douglas Ave., 903 F.2d 490, 492 (7th Cir.1990) (\"we will look beyond the express language of a statute only where that statutory language is ambiguous or where a literal interpretation would lead to an absurd result or thwart the purpose of the overall statutory scheme\").13  We are of the opinion that the phrase \"committed on occasions different from one another\" is unambiguous.14  Other members of this court, however, believe the phrase \"committed on occasions different from one another\" is ambiguous, and have looked to the legislative history for guidance.  For this reason, a brief review of the legislative history becomes necessary.\\n\\n\\n24\\nIn 1988, Senator Joseph Biden proposed amending Sec. 924(e)(1) of the ACCA to require sentence enhancement for multiple convictions only when those convictions resulted from crimes \"committed on occasions different from one another.\"   This new language was proposed after the Eighth Circuit\\'s original decision in Petty, in which the court held that the ACCA\\'s fifteen year minimum sentence could be imposed on a defendant with six prior convictions for armed robbery stemming from an incident in which the defendant robbed six different people in a restaurant simultaneously.  United States v. Petty, 798 F.2d 1157, 1159-60 (8th Cir.1986), vacated, 481 U.S. 1034, 107 S.Ct. 1968, 95 L.Ed.2d 810 (1987).15  Although neither the statute nor the legislative history defines exactly what Congress meant by \"occasions different from one another,\"16 the legislative history does more than merely imply that Congress intended only to preclude the classification of simultaneous offenses as separate offenses for the purposes of sentence enhancement under the ACCA.  Senator Biden explained that the amendment would serve to punish career offenders, even for multiple offenses committed on the same night, so long as the crimes are not simultaneous in nature.\\n\\n\\n25\\n\"Under the amendment, the three previous convictions would have to be for offenses \\'committed [on] occasions different from one another.\\'   Thus a single multicount conviction could still qualify where the counts related to crimes committed on different occasions, but a robbery of multiple victims simultaneously (as in Petty) would count as only one conviction.\"\\n\\n\\n26\\n134 Cong.Rec. S17,370 (daily ed. Nov. 10, 1988) (remarks of Sen.  Biden).  Congress added the phrase \"committed on occasions different from one another\" to address situations similar to Petty, where a defendant\\'s single action results in the commission of multiple, simultaneous crimes.  The amendment would also preclude the separate consideration of multiple convictions arising from a single criminal act that violates several different criminal statutes.  See supra n. 10.  Neither of these situations is presented by the case before us.\\n\\n\\n27\\nAs made clear earlier in this opinion, Hudspeth did not commit three simultaneous crimes against multiple victims as the defendant did in Petty where, at one time, with one single command, and in one location, Petty robbed six people.  Nor did Hudspeth violate several statutes with a single criminal act.  Hudspeth committed three separate crimes, at three separate times, against three separate victims, in three separate locations.  Under the plain language of Sec. 924(e)(1) as well as the legislative history, Hudspeth committed his crimes on three \"occasions different from one another.\"\\n\\nB. Double Jeopardy\\n\\n28\\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause states that no person shall \"be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\"   U.S. Const., amend.  V.  The Clause prohibits multiple punishments for the same offense.  Ohio v. Johnson, 467 U.S. 493, 498, 104 S.Ct. 2536, 2540, 81 L.Ed.2d 425 (1984).  A sentencing court may not sentence a defendant to multiple punishments for the same offense in excess of the total punishment authorized by the legislature.  United States v. Halper, 490 U.S. 435, 450-51, 109 S.Ct. 1892, 1902-03, 104 L.Ed.2d 487 (1989).\\n\\n\\n29\\nIn an unpublished order, a panel of this court initially vacated Hudspeth\\'s original sentence and remanded the case to the district court, with instructions to \"hold a hearing, enter findings of fact, and determine whether a proper basis exists for applying the Sec. 924(e) enhancement.\"  United States v. Hudspeth, No. 91-3786, 1992 WL 205666, at * 2, 1992 U.S.App. LEXIS 20581, at * 5 (7th Cir.  Aug. 20, 1992).  The district court had based Hudspeth\\'s original sentence on Hudspeth\\'s 1975 adjudication of juvenile delinquency for burglary, 1980 conviction for burglary, and 1983 convictions for three burglaries.  On remand, the government abandoned its reliance on Hudspeth\\'s juvenile burglary, and focused on his three 1983 state convictions for burglary.  After the resentencing hearing, the district court concluded that Hudspeth had committed three prior burglaries \"on occasions different from one another\" and imposed the fifteen year minimum sentence required by the ACCA.\\n\\n\\n30\\nHudspeth argues that the district court\\'s recalculation of his sentence after his resentencing hearing placed him in jeopardy twice for the same offense.17  He argues that the government improperly premised its request for an enhanced sentence on a version of Hudspeth\\'s criminal conviction history different than the version presented at the original sentencing hearing.  This argument does not justify reversal.\\n\\n\\n31\\nHudspeth\\'s argument is based on the government\\'s reliance at resentencing on Hudspeth\\'s three 1983 burglaries.  Hudspeth contends that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits the approach the government took here--initially premising its request for sentence enhancement on one version of Hudspeth\\'s criminal conviction history and, at resentencing, premising its request for sentence enhancement on a second version.\\n\\n\\n32\\nSentencing matters do not ordinarily have the \"qualities of constitutional finality that attend an acquittal.\"  United States v. DiFrancesco, 449 U.S. 117, 134, 101 S.Ct. 426, 436, 66 L.Ed.2d 328 (1980).  As a result, recidivist statutes that impose enhanced sentences on repeat offenders generally do not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  See, e.g., Denton v. Duckworth, 873 F.2d 144, 147 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 941, 110 S.Ct. 341, 107 L.Ed.2d 330 (1989) (holding that the Double Jeopardy Clause was not violated by an Indiana recidivist statute that did not impose additional punishment for a past crime, but rather imposed additional punishment for the later crime).  The same reasoning upholds the constitutionality of sentence enhancement under the United States Sentencing Guidelines.  See, e.g., United States v. Duarte, 28 F.3d 47 (7th Cir.1994) (sentence enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1 did not raise double jeopardy concerns);  United States v. Shaw, 26 F.3d 700 (7th Cir.1994) (\"[A] sentence enhanced by reference to a prior conviction is not a \\'second punishment for the first crime.\\'   It is a punishment for the new crime, tailored to the offender\\'s circumstances in light of knowledge that higher penalties are needed to deter persons who have not responded to lesser sanctions\").\\n\\n\\n33\\nSentence enhancement for \"career criminals\" under the ACCA implicates no greater double jeopardy concerns than sentence enhancement under other recidivist statutes or the United States Sentencing Guidelines.  Enhanced sentences based on valid prior convictions that are within the appropriate sentencing range, as were both of Hudspeth\\'s sentences, result in no double jeopardy violations.\\n\\n\\n34\\nThe government\\'s change in tactics at Hudspeth\\'s resentencing hearing, from reliance on Hudspeth\\'s 1975, 1980 and 1983 offenses to reliance on only the 1983 convictions, does not alter our conclusion.  The Double Jeopardy Clause bars retrial of a defendant when the defendant\\'s conviction is reversed because the government\\'s evidence was insufficient to sustain the jury\\'s verdict.  Burks v. United States, 437 U.S. 1, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978).  In contrast, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar retrial of a defendant when the defendant\\'s conviction is set aside for trial error, such as erroneously admitted evidence.  Lockhart v. Nelson, 488 U.S. 33, 40, 109 S.Ct. 285, 290, 102 L.Ed.2d 265 (1988) (finding no double jeopardy violation where a defendant was resentenced based on an additional felony conviction not offered or admitted at original sentencing).\\n\\n\\n35\\nThe procedural error committed by the sentencing court at Hudspeth\\'s initial sentencing hearing was simple trial error.  We remanded simply to ask the sentencing court to expand the record on evidence that had already been received.  A sentencing court\\'s erroneous reliance on an insufficient record in imposing an enhanced sentence does not preclude correction of that sentence by a further review of the record.  We hold that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not preclude the recalculation of a defendant\\'s sentence enhancement initially vacated for an insufficient record.\\n\\nIII.\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n36\\nWe hold that Hudspeth\\'s 1983 convictions for three counts of burglary resulted from crimes \"committed on occasions different from one another\" and conclude that the district court\\'s enhancement of Hudspeth\\'s sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e)(1) was proper.  We also hold that the district court\\'s recalculation of Hudspeth\\'s sentence resulted in no double jeopardy violation.\\n\\nThe defendant\\'s sentence is\\n\\n37\\nAFFIRMED.\\n\\n\\n38\\nBAUER, Circuit Judge, concurring.\\n\\n\\n39\\nI concur.  My concurrence is both simple and, as far as it goes, complete.  I believe the defendant was appropriately sentenced because, in my opinion, the record shows three separate crimes against separate victims and not a single crime or criminal occasion (whatever that is).\\n\\n\\n40\\nFLAUM, Circuit Judge, with whom POSNER, Chief Judge, and ROVNER, Circuit Judge, join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\\n\\n\\n41\\nAt its core, this case requires us to determine the meaning of the statutory language \"occasions different from one another,\" 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e)(1), a phrase that most of us agree is ambiguous.  The full court has divided roughly between those who believe the test of what is an \"occasion\" calls for a bright-line rule and those who believe that a fact-bound, case-by-case method is preferable.  I write separately to explain why I believe the latter approach is better suited to the inquiry we are asked to make.\\n\\n\\n42\\nThe statutory text and structure provide no clues as to precisely what Congress meant by the term \"occasions\";  Congress used the term without elaboration.  As the principal opinions note, in grappling with the ambiguity of the ACCA, we (and other courts) have held that a different \"occasion\" means a \"separate and distinct criminal episode,\" United States v. Godinez, 998 F.2d 471, 472 (7th Cir.1993);  United States v. Schieman, 894 F.2d 909, 913 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 856, 111 S.Ct. 155, 112 L.Ed.2d 121 (1990), but this refinement is only marginally less ambiguous than the statutory provision it explains.  The legislative history provides some illumination--we know that simultaneous crimes are to be counted as a single occasion--but not enough to dispose of this case as we are not told whether to make the negative inference that nonsimultaneous crimes cannot occur on one occasion.  In my view, the import of the post-Petty amendment to the ACCA is that Congress has spoken clearly to a particular factual scenario (several robberies accomplished by the same \"stick-em-up\"), but has otherwise left to the courts the task of giving meaning to the phrase \"committed on occasions different from one another.\"   Thus, the amendment does not resolve, once and for all, that all cases involving several crimes committed hard on the heels of one another, though not simultaneously, count as different criminal occasions.  Indeed, the snippet of legislative history cited in the majority opinion says as much--\"a single multi-count conviction could still qualify where the counts related to crimes committed on different occasions.\"   See supra at 14 (emphasis added).  Sequential crimes can, and often will, involve multiple occasions, but this need not always be the case.\\n\\n\\n43\\nThe majority concludes that Hudspeth ought to receive the ACCA enhancement on the basis of his three distinct aggressions against three separate victims in three separate locations.  This approach has the apparent virtue of drawing a bright-line (between simultaneous and sequential crimes) that would make the law more predictable for defendants and easier to apply for courts.*  For these reasons, Congress might rationally adopt such a rule, though I believe its mechanical application would lead to just as many, if not more, arbitrary results as a case-by-case approach would produce.  For example, compare Hudspeth\\'s situation with that of a defendant who breaks into a small office building (one address, one owner, one insurance company) and then pries his way into three locked offices within that building, absconding with all of the electronic equipment and petty cash he can find.  It would be reasonable to conclude that Hudspeth and our hypothetical defendant are equally aggressive, dangerous, and culpable.  Both could have ceased after a single entry, but instead chose to expand their illegal activities to two additional locations before stopping (or being stopped).  Yet under the proposed bright-line rule, it is three strikes and you\\'re out for Hudspeth while his more fortunate cohort remains in the batter\\'s box with just one strike, though we can be reasonably certain that, like his brother in crime, Hudspeth sought cash and easily-fenced appliances and had no particular affinity for doughnuts, dry cleaning, or insurance--or knew or cared who owned what.\\n\\n\\n44\\nIn my view, the text, structure, and history of the ACCA neither compel nor suggest this particular (or any) bright-line rule.  Indeed, in view of the malleability of the relevant terms (\"occasions different from one another\" and \"separate and distinct criminal episode\"), see United States v. Balascsak, 873 F.2d 673 (3d Cir.1989) (en banc ), cert denied, 498 U.S. 864, 111 S.Ct. 173, 112 L.Ed.2d 138 (1990), I find it quite plausible that Congress declined to define them more precisely so that judges could decide what is an \"occasion\" by applying an ordinary, every-day meaning to the myriad factual scenarios that arise.  We have in the past rejected the notion that fact-dependent standards necessarily produce more inconsistent and arbitrary results than hard and fast rules, see Morgan v. Bank of Waukegan, 804 F.2d 970, 977 (7th Cir.1986), and we ought to do so again today.  \"[D]eveloping the law on a case-by-case basis and drawing lines depending on the facts is the stuff of judging,\" Balascsak, 873 F.2d at 685 (Becker, J., concurring), and over time this process shapes the contours of the law in such a way that future cases follow increasingly more predictably from those that preceded them.  For example, we know from Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970), and Petty that the simultaneous robbery of six persons counts as a single occasion while Schieman (involving an assault following a robbery) and Godinez (involving a kidnapping following a robbery) establish that one crime following soon after another can be a separate occasion.  These cases guide our analysis of the instant case, though, in my view, they are not dispositive because Hudspeth\\'s actions fall within the gray area between what the earlier cases establish as single and multiple occasions.  While the lapse of time surely is an important factor in determining the number of \"occasions\" or \"episodes\", I read our cases to suggest that other practical considerations--whether the events in question reflect distinct aggressions or demonstrate heightened criminal culpability or dangerousness to society--also may be relevant.  See Godinez, 998 F.2d at 472-73.   Congress may, of course, amend the ACCA to guide courts with respect to what is an occasion, but unless and until it does, I believe that a nuanced, fact-based approach better resolves how many occasions are encompassed within a particular course of conduct.  In this case, I find that Hudspeth\\'s actions, like those of the hypothetical defendant sketched above, were the product of a single aggression and I view the fact that Hudspeth and his partners entered several attached but separate stores at sequential addresses, as opposed to, for example, several departments of a single larger store, to be a mere fortuity in these circumstances.  In sum, I endorse Judge Ripple\\'s fact-based approach and agree that we should reverse the sentence in this case.\\n\\n\\n45\\nRIPPLE, Circuit Judge, with whom POSNER, Chief Judge, and FAIRCHILD, FLAUM, and ROVNER, Circuit Judges, join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\\n\\n\\n46\\nThomas L. Hudspeth and several others broke into a shopping mall and, in thirty-six minutes\\' time, burglarized three stores.  A bobtailed1 en banc court holds that those thirty-six minutes qualify him as a career criminal.  Because I believe that this holding is contrary to the intent of the Congress and constitutes a significant departure from the approach this court has taken in previous cases, I respectfully dissent.\\n\\n\\n47\\n* BACKGROUND\\n\\n\\n48\\nA person who has a previous felony conviction may not legally possess a firearm.  18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g)(1).  If a prior felon is convicted of the unlawful possession of a firearm under this statutory provision and has the requisite prior criminal history, he is considered a \"career criminal\" and must be sentenced under the mandatory sentence enhancement section of the ACCA, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e)(1).\\n\\n\\n49\\nOn August 1, 1991, Mr. Hudspeth entered a plea of guilty to the charge of unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.  Prior to the plea agreement, the government had notified Mr. Hudspeth that it would seek, pursuant to Sec. 924(e)(1), the enhancement of his sentence to a term of imprisonment of not less than fifteen years with no possibility of parole.  In its Information Charging Prior Offense, filed July 8, 1991, the government listed three previous violent felony convictions, all committed in Sangamon County, Illinois:  (1) the August 8, 1983 conviction of three separate counts of burglary committed on March 27, 1983;  (2) the October 30, 1980 conviction of burglary;  and (3) the July 8, 1975 adjudication of juvenile delinquency for burglary.  Following acceptance of Mr. Hudspeth\\'s guilty plea, the district court found that he was a career criminal subject to the sentence enhancement.2  Mr. Hudspeth appealed.\\n\\n\\n50\\nIn an unpublished order, a panel of this court vacated the sentence and remanded the case for a hearing with respect to the Sec. 924(e) enhancement.  United States v. Hudspeth, No. 91-3786, 1992 WL 205666 (7th Cir.  Aug. 20, 1992).  It specifically directed the district court to examine the facts surrounding the juvenile burglary and the three 1983 convictions in deciding whether Mr. Hudspeth was convicted of three violent felonies as defined by the statute.3  The court pointed out that, with respect to the 1983 burglaries at issue here, the record contained little information concerning the circumstances surrounding the commission of these crimes:\\n\\n\\n51\\nThe only information we have on the 1983 burglaries, however, is contained in the PSR, which summarily describes the burglaries as follows:  \"The defendant, Thomas Edwards, and Ronnie Edwards entered Homestyle Cleaners, Melocreme Donut, and Farmer\\'s Insurance Company, all located in Springfield, Illinois.\"   Defendant-Appellant\\'s Appendix, at 45.  This brief description of the burglaries does not reveal whether they took place on the same day or weeks apart, whether the burglarized businesses are in the same building or across town, or whether the crimes were connected in any way.  Further, the district court did not examine the facts surrounding these burglaries.  Consequently, we do not have sufficient information to discern whether the 1983 burglaries were part of the same or separate and distinct criminal episodes, and therefore cannot decide whether Hudspeth\\'s sentence was properly enhanced under Sec. 924(e) (footnote omitted).\\n\\n\\n52\\nR.37 at 3.  The court further noted that the government had never suggested that these 1983 convictions ought to be counted separately for purposes of Sec. 924(e) until it amended its brief one week before oral argument in this court.  Characterizing the attempt to proceed in this court on a basis not urged in the district court as \"disturbing,\" the court admonished the government to state clearly the basis of the enhancement it was seeking during the remand proceedings in the district court.\\n\\n\\n53\\nOn remand, the government and district court focused only on the 1983 conviction of three counts of burglary.4  The pertinent facts are as follows.  Around 7:15 p.m. on March 27, 1983, Mr. Hudspeth and two others broke into three adjacent stores in the Laketown Shopping Center, a strip mall in Springfield, Illinois.  There is a factual ambiguity in the record as to the point of entry from the exterior of the mall.5  In just over one-half hour, they ransacked a doughnut shop, a cleaning business, and an insurance agency.  A hole had been punched into the wall between the cleaners and the doughnut shop, allowing passage between those stores, and the door between the doughnut shop and the insurance company had been opened.  In the cleaners was a canvas bag containing such tools as chisels, screwdrivers, pry bars, a pipe wrench and a small sledgehammer.  Mr. Hudspeth was arrested in the doughnut shop.\\n\\n\\n54\\nAfter the resentencing hearing, the district court concluded that the burglaries in the mall constituted three \"separate crimes against separate victims in separate locations.\"   The court reasoned that the defendant \"could have stopped after one burglary but he consciously made a decision to break through the walls and burglarize one business after another.\"   Order of Feb. 1, 1993, R.51 at 2.  On that basis, the court held that Mr. Hudspeth qualified for the Sec. 924(e) enhancement.\\n\\nII\\n\\n55\\nMr. Hudspeth asserts that the recalculation of his sentence placed him in jeopardy twice for the same offense.6  If he is correct, the Double Jeopardy Clause bars his resentencing, and it would be unnecessary to consider further the other matters raised on appeal.  Accordingly, I address this issue first.  A double jeopardy allegation is a legal question which we review de novo.  United States v. Furlett, 974 F.2d 839, 842 (7th Cir.1992).\\n\\n1.\\n\\n56\\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause provides that no person shall \"be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\"   U.S. Const., amend.  V.  The Clause \"affords a defendant three basic protections:  \\' \"[It] protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal.  It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction.  And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\" \\' \"  Ohio v. Johnson, 467 U.S. 493, 498, 104 S.Ct. 2536, 2540, 81 L.Ed.2d 425 (1984) (citations omitted).  In this latter regard, the Double Jeopardy Clause ensures that \"sentencing courts do not exceed, by the device of multiple punishments, the limits prescribed by the legislative branch of government, in which lies the substantive power to define crimes and prescribe punishments.\"  Jones v. Thomas, 491 U.S. 376, 381, 109 S.Ct. 2522, 2525-26, 105 L.Ed.2d 322 (1989).  Courts may not impose multiple punishments for the same offense in excess of the total punishment authorized by the legislature.  United States v. Halper, 490 U.S. 435, 450-51, 109 S.Ct. 1892, 1902-03, 104 L.Ed.2d 487 (1989).\\n\\n2.\\n\\n57\\nAt the outset, it is necessary to clarify the precise issue before the court by addressing several threshold matters raised by Mr. Hudspeth.  First, no additional factual bases were proffered by the government at resentencing.  Both the sentence initially imposed upon Mr. Hudspeth and the sentence imposed after remand from this court were based upon the same factual predicate;  no other convictions or other aspects of Mr. Hudspeth\\'s past criminal history were included for the first time in the resentencing calculations.  Second, Mr. Hudspeth\\'s claim that he was uninformed of the prior offenses is without merit.  The Information Charging Prior Offenses adequately notified the defendant of the predicate convictions on which the government relied for purposes of enhancement.  This information was filed on July 8, 1991, eighteen days after the indictment was returned and twenty-three days before Mr. Hudspeth signed the plea agreement.  It stated that these prior convictions would justify enhancement of Mr. Hudspeth\\'s sentence under Sec. 924(e) if he were convicted.  The plea agreement, which Mr. Hudspeth signed, also listed the predicate convictions.  Through these steps, the government clearly gave the defendant adequate notice of the prior convictions upon which it sought enhancement.7  The Supreme Court\\'s decision in Oyler v. Boles, 368 U.S. 448, 82 S.Ct. 501, 7 L.Ed.2d 446 (1962), upon which Mr. Hudspeth relies, requires that the defendant \"receive reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard relative to the recidivist charge.\"  Id. at 452, 82 S.Ct. at 504.   The government met its burden by providing timely notice (the Information Charging Prior Offenses) and proof of the validity of the prior convictions.  Mr. Hudspeth had the opportunity to contest the record as to his prior convictions both before signing the plea agreement and at the sentencing hearing.  He had a further opportunity to challenge the government\\'s position concerning the 1983 burglary conviction during the proceedings upon remand.  Mr. Hudspeth\\'s threshold allegations are without merit.\\n\\n3.\\n\\n58\\nI now turn to Mr. Hudspeth\\'s principal contention with respect to the Double Jeopardy Clause.  In his view, by \"unbundling\" the 1983 conviction on remand, the government initially premised its request for enhancement of the sentence on one version of his criminal conviction history and then, on remand, premised a second request for enhancement on a second version.\\n\\n\\n59\\nAt the outset, I note that, although the precise contours of the protection against double jeopardy in the non-capital sentencing context may not be entirely settled,8 existing caselaw makes it highly unlikely that the Double Jeopardy Clause is implicated in the situation at hand.  As the Supreme Court pointedly noted in United States v. DiFrancesco, 449 U.S. 117, 134, 101 S.Ct. 426, 436, 66 L.Ed.2d 328 (1980), a sentencing matter does not ordinarily have the \"qualities of constitutional finality that attend an acquittal.\"   As a general rule, therefore, the caselaw has maintained that recidivist statutes imposing enhanced sentences on repeat offenders do not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Spencer v. Texas, 385 U.S. 554, 559-60, 87 S.Ct. 648, 651, 17 L.Ed.2d 606 (1967);9  Denton v. Duckworth, 873 F.2d 144, 147 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 941, 110 S.Ct. 341, 107 L.Ed.2d 330 (1989);10  United States v. Vigil, 818 F.2d 738, 742 (10th Cir.1987);11  United States v. Pleasant, 730 F.2d 657, 662 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 869, 105 S.Ct. 216, 83 L.Ed.2d 146 (1984);12  United States v. Bowdach, 561 F.2d 1160, 1176 (5th Cir.1977).13  This court has clearly stated that sentence enhancement under the Sentencing Guidelines does not create multiple punishments for a crime in violation of the double jeopardy clause.  United States v. Duarte, 28 F.3d 47, 48 (7th Cir.1994) (finding no double jeopardy in U.S.S.G. Sec. 3C1.1 obstruction of justice enhancement);  United States v. Shaw, 26 F.3d 700, 701 (7th Cir.1994) (finding no error in use of prior conviction to enhance another sentence because it is not a \"second punishment\" for the first crime);  United States v. Saunders, 973 F.2d 1354, 1365 (7th Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1026, 122 L.Ed.2d 171 (1993) (holding that calculation of sentence within statutory range does not constitute multiple punishment);  accord United States v. Howard, 998 F.2d 42, 48-49 (2d Cir.1993) (holding that cumulative punishments upon recidivist defendants do not violate Double Jeopardy Clause).\\n\\n\\n60\\nI do not believe there is any reason to treat differently \"career criminal\" sentence enhancement under the ACCA.  In this case, both the original and second sentences were within the sentencing range and were made on the basis of the same predicate convictions.  The statutory scheme is designed to remove from society for a longer period of time those individuals who have demonstrated, because of their recurring violent behavior, that they are an unusual danger to others.\\n\\n\\n61\\nNor do I agree that the fact that the government, on remand, for the first time characterized the convictions based on the events of March 27, 1983 as three episodes necessarily alters the above analysis and implicates the strictures of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  However, even if I were to assume arguendo that the Double Jeopardy Clause is applicable in this situation, my analysis would be guided by the decision of the Supreme Court in Lockhart v. Nelson, 488 U.S. 33, 109 S.Ct. 285, 102 L.Ed.2d 265 (1988).  In Nelson, the trial court, sentencing the defendant under a state habitual criminal statute,14 admitted evidence of four felony convictions.  It was discovered later that one of the offenses had been pardoned.  When the State announced its intention to resentence the defendant as an habitual offender on the basis of a conviction not offered or admitted at the original sentencing hearing, the defendant raised the defense of double jeopardy.  Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the Court, noted that, in Burks v. United States, 437 U.S. 1, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978), the Court had recognized an exception to the general rule that double jeopardy does not bar retrial when a defendant has succeeded in getting his conviction set aside for error in the earlier proceedings.  Id. at 39, 109 S.Ct. at 290.  Burks held that, when a defendant\\'s conviction is reversed on the ground of insufficient evidence to sustain the jury\\'s verdict, the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a retrial on the same charge because such a holding amounts to a determination that the trial court should have entered a judgment of acquittal on the ground of insufficient evidence.  The Chief Justice concluded that the \"logic of Burks \" requires that the Double Jeopardy Clause not bar retrial when a reviewing court determines that a conviction must be reversed because evidence was admitted erroneously and, without that evidence, the defendant could not have been convicted due to insufficient evidence.  Id. at 40, 109 S.Ct. at 290.   He wrote:\\n\\n\\n62\\nBurks was careful to point out that a reversal based solely on evidentiary insufficiency has fundamentally different implications, for double jeopardy purposes, than a reversal based on such ordinary \"trial errors\" as the \"incorrect receipt or rejection of evidence.\"  437 U.S. at 14-16, [98 S.Ct. at 2148-50].  While the former is in effect a finding \"that the government has failed to prove its case\" against the defendant, the latter \"implies nothing with respect to the guilt or innocence of the defendant,\" but is simply \"a determination that [he] has been convicted through a judicial process which is defective in some fundamental respect.\"  Id. at 15, 98 S.Ct. at 2149 (emphasis added).\\n\\n\\n63\\nNelson, 488 U.S. at 40, 109 S.Ct. at 290.   He further explained that \"[t]he fact that one of the convictions had been later pardoned by the Governor vitiated its legal effect, but it did not deprive the certified copy of that conviction of its probative value under the statute.\"  Id.  In the Court\\'s view, the admission of the pardoned conviction therefore amounted to \"trial error.\"\\n\\n\\n64\\nPermitting retrial in this instance is not the sort of governmental oppression at which the Double Jeopardy Clause is aimed;  rather, it serves the interest of the defendant by affording him an opportunity to \"obtai[n] a fair readjudication of his guilt free from error.\"\\n\\n\\n65\\nId. at 42, 109 S.Ct. at 291 (quoting Burks, 437 U.S. at 15, 98 S.Ct. at 2149).\\n\\n\\n66\\nThe circumstances creating trial error in Nelson are similar, although not identical,15 to those now before this court.  In Nelson, a defendant pleaded guilty to burglary and was sentenced under the state\\'s habitual criminal statute.  Prior felony convictions were introduced at the sentencing hearing.  A subsequent issue concerning one of those prior convictions arose after sentencing--the pardon of one of the convictions.  At that point the government announced that it intended to rely on another prior conviction not offered or admitted at the initial sentencing hearing.  In this case, however, the subsequent issue was the insufficiency of the information about Mr. Hudspeth\\'s predicate convictions.  Also in this case, unlike in Nelson, the government relied on the convictions introduced in the earlier proceeding;  it simply characterized the 1983 burglary conviction as three separate and distinct episodes justifying enhancement.\\n\\n\\n67\\nAs in Nelson, the procedural error from Mr. Hudspeth\\'s first sentencing was simple trial error.  We remanded because the information presented by the district court to the court of appeals was insufficient to discern the propriety of the enhancement, not because the evidence presented by the government was insufficient to support a conviction.  We requested an expansion of the record on the evidence that had already been received.  A sentencing court\\'s failure to present an adequate record of the evidence used for enhancement of the sentence does not lead to the type of sentence correction that is barred by double jeopardy.  This is not a \"case of the state getting a second chance to prove something it had failed to prove the first time, the heart of double jeopardy\\'s bar.\"  Tate v. Armontrout, 914 F.2d 1022, 1026-27 (8th Cir.1990) (concluding that an insufficient record was trial error);  see also Linam v. Griffin, 685 F.2d 369, 374 (10th Cir.1982) (holding that double jeopardy does not bar retrial when evidence is incorrectly excluded), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1211, 103 S.Ct. 1207, 75 L.Ed.2d 447 (1983).\\n\\n\\n68\\nIn reaching the conclusion that the Double Jeopardy Clause is not violated by the reconsideration of the three convictions entered in the original proceeding, I follow a path analogous to that set out in this court\\'s decision in Denton v. Duckworth, 873 F.2d 144, 148 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 941, 110 S.Ct. 341, 107 L.Ed.2d 330 (1989).  There we concluded that, assuming that the Double Jeopardy Clause applies, it does not bar redetermination of a defendant\\'s status as an habitual offender under the Indiana habitual offender statute when the basis of that remand is trial error.  Today, again assuming the applicability of the Clause, I conclude that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not affect the recalculation of a sentence enhancement that was vacated for an insufficient record, a trial error.  Therefore, there was no double jeopardy violation in the redetermination of Mr. Hudspeth\\'s status as a career criminal under Sec. 924(e) of the ACCA.\\n\\nIII\\n\\n69\\nMr. Hudspeth contends that the 1983 burglaries of three adjoining stores in the same building within thirty-six minutes was a single project and therefore must, as a matter of law, constitute a single episode for purposes of the Sec. 924(e) enhancement.16  The government responds that the burglaries constituted separate entries into three separate stores and included an independent choice to continue on after each burglary.\\n\\n\\n70\\nThe ACCA requires that a series of determinations be made before its heavy penalties are imposed:  The offender must be a felon convicted of illegal possession of a firearm, and thus in violation of Sec. 922(g), and must have had three previous convictions for a violent felony and/or serious drug offense which were committed on occasions different from one another under Sec. 924(e).  When these statutory requirements are met, the offender is categorized as a career criminal and the mandatory enhanced sentence of not less than fifteen years of imprisonment without eligibility for parole, probation, or suspended sentence is imposed.17\\n\\n\\n71\\nFrom the beginning, the purpose of this statute has been clear.  Congress intended to devise a mechanism that would identify the offender whose repeated aggressions against society pose a special danger to law-abiding persons and would isolate that person from society for a longer period of time.  See Armed Career Criminal Act:  Hearing on H.R. 1627 and S. 52 Before the Subcomm. on Crime of the House Judiciary Comm., 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 12-13 (1984) (setting forth Senator Specter\\'s comments that Act was promulgated to punish habitual offenders);  S.Rep. No. 585, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 20 (1982) (discussing congressional intent to punish the small number of repeat offenders committing most of the violent crime in America).  The decision of the Eighth Circuit in United States v. Petty, 798 F.2d 1157 (8th Cir.1986), vacated, 481 U.S. 1034, 107 S.Ct. 1968, 95 L.Ed.2d 810 (1987) was the early case that focused attention on the purpose of the statute.  Petty robbed six persons in a restaurant at the same time.  The Eighth Circuit initially held that the loss to six different victims constituted six different offenses and therefore required an enhancement of the sentence.  The Supreme Court vacated the judgment and instructed the appellate court to reconsider in view of the Solicitor General\\'s position that offenses should be counted separately only if they occurred at different times, and that \"career criminal\" status should reflect a history of \"multiple criminal episodes\" rather than multiple convictions arising from a single \"episode.\"  Petty, 481 U.S. at 1034-35, 107 S.Ct. at 1968-69.   On remand, the Eighth Circuit adopted that approach and held that the simultaneous robberies created one criminal episode.  United States v. Petty, 828 F.2d 2, 3 (8th Cir.1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1057, 108 S.Ct. 2827, 100 L.Ed.2d 928 (1988).  Our colleagues in the Eighth Circuit noted, \"the legislative history [of the ACCA] strongly supports the conclusion that the statute was intended to reach multiple criminal episodes that were distinct in time, not multiple felony convictions arising out of a single criminal episode.\"  Petty, 828 F.2d at 3.\\n\\n\\n72\\nA subsequent amendment made clear that the position of the Solicitor General was indeed correct.  Congress specifically directed that the predicate felonies be \"committed on occasions different from one another.\"   Senator Joseph Biden, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, explained the amendment of the ACCA by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub.L. No. 100-690, section 7056, 102 Stat. 4181, 4402 (1988):\\n\\n\\n73\\nUnder the amendment, the three previous convictions would have to be for offenses \"committed [on] occasions different from one another.\"   Thus, a single multicount conviction could still qualify where the counts related to crimes committed on different occasions, but a robbery of multiple victims simultaneously (as in Petty) would count as only one conviction.  This interpretation plainly expresses that concept of what is meant by a \"career criminal,\" that is, a person who over the course of time commits three or more of the enumerated kinds of felonies and is convicted therefor.  It is appropriate to clarify the statute ... to insure that its rigorous sentencing provisions apply only as intended in cases meriting such strict punishment.\\n\\n\\n74\\n134 Cong.Rec. S17,370 (daily ed. Nov. 10, 1988).\\n\\n\\n75\\nThis amendment does not provide an answer on the cold print of the statute books to the fact-specific case before us.  However, when read with the rest of the legislative history and the interpretation given the statute by the Supreme Court, the congressional objective can hardly be in doubt.  The Supreme Court, reviewing the legislative history of the ACCA, noted the aim of the Act at recidivist defendants:\\n\\n\\n76\\n[T]hroughout the history of the enhancement provision, Congress focused its efforts on career offenders--those who commit a large number of fairly serious crimes as their means of livelihood, and who, because they possess weapons, present at least a potential threat of harm to persons.\\n\\n\\n77\\nTaylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 587-88, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2152, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990);  Chief Judge Posner has described a career criminal as \"incorrigible, undeterrable, recidivating, unresponsive to the \\'specific deterrence\\' of having been previously convicted.\"  United States v. Belton, 890 F.2d 9, 10 (7th Cir.1989) (considering career offender enhancement under U.S.S.G. Sec. 4B1.1), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 391, 121 L.Ed.2d 299 (1992).\\n\\n\\n78\\nUntil today, our decisions have reflected a thoughtful and measured approach to the task required by the statute--identifying those criminals whose repetitive behavior requires a special degree of isolation from society.  Our previous decisions in this area, and, indeed, the previous decisions of the other circuits, have attempted to fulfill the congressional mandate by a progressive refinement of the methodology to be employed by the trial courts in determining whether the previous crimes of the defendant constitute a single episode or multiple episodes.  In United States v. Schieman, 894 F.2d 909, 912 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 856, 111 S.Ct. 155, 112 L.Ed.2d 121 (1990), we adopted, through the pen of Judge Bauer, the \"separate and distinct criminal episode\" test to determine whether the defendant\\'s prior felonies were committed on different occasions as required by Sec. 924(e).  Id. at 913.   Our later cases have continued to apply this test.18  The vast majority of other courts of appeals have also adopted it.19  The application of the \"separate and distinct episodes\" test has, of necessity, been quite fact specific.  Yet, when assessed in its entirety, the caselaw reflects both an awareness that Congress\\' intent in enacting the section was to punish recidivist behavior and the reality that such recidivism can be manifest in relatively short time frames and in situations not far removed from each other.20  These cases demonstrate that courts usually have counted separately all convictions (or counts within a conviction) that occurred at distinct times or involved different locations or distinguishable criminal schemes.  By contrast, a crime involving multiple offenses occurring simultaneously has been held to be a single episode counting as a single conviction under Sec. 924(e)(1).21  Factors of time and distance must be evaluated in terms of the legislative intent in order to identify and segregate the true recidivist.\\n\\n\\n79\\nThe next significant attempt to refine further our effort to fulfill the congressional mandate occurred in United States v. Godinez, 998 F.2d 471 (7th Cir.1993).  In that case, Judge Easterbrook\\'s analysis made it clear that the distinction between one and multiple episodes must, in order to reflect accurately the congressional intent, be a practical distinction rather than a metaphysical one.  In Godinez, the defendant kidnapped a woman in order to use her car in a robbery.  After leaving her tied up in his apartment, the defendant proceeded to rob a convenience store.  The court emphasized that the starting point in the analysis must be the language of the statute;  that language directs the implementation of the enhanced punishment scheme when the crimes took place \"on occasions different from one another.\"  Id. at 472.   In an attempt to deal with the recurring problem of proximity in time or distance, the court held that, in order to constitute a separate episode, the crimes must reflect distinct aggressions.  In fashioning this approach, the court noted with approval the analysis of the Second Circuit in United States v. Towne, 870 F.2d 880, 888-91 (2d.  Cir.), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1101, 109 S.Ct. 2456, 104 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1989).  The Second Circuit found that a defendant\\'s kidnapping and rape of one victim were \"part of a continuous course of conduct which was directed at a single victim,\" even though there were different felonies committed with some period of time between the two crimes.  Thus the attacks were a single criminal episode.  Id. at 891.   Judge Easterbrook contrasted Godinez\\'s crimes against different victims, in different places, more than an hour apart:  \"It would strain language considerably, without serving any purpose plausibly attributed to Congress, to treat the kidnapping and the robbery as a single \\'occasion.\\' \"  Godinez, 998 F.2d at 473.\\n\\n\\n80\\nIn a very short period of time, Mr. Hudspeth and his accomplices, with a sledgehammer and other tools, broke into three adjoining businesses in one location and ransacked them.  Their arrival with such tools designed to expedite the penetration of the walls between the adjacent businesses reflects a clear plan for the group to work together to break through from one business to another.  This venture did not comprise \"distinct aggressions,\" id., but rather a singular, continuous course of conduct that depended on the spatial proximity of these stores.  To characterize this venture as a single criminal act that, after reflection, Mr. Hudspeth and his cohorts chose to extend into a second and then a third shop requires that we ignore the counsel of Godinez that such assessments be based on the practical realities of the situation rather than on the metaphysical possibility that, at any given point in the activity, one of the perpetrators might have had a change of heart.  Indeed, as the differences of opinion in the police reports reflect, the record does not establish any particular sequence to the perpetrators\\' activity, much less any deliberate choice on their part.\\n\\n\\n81\\nThe majority asserts that the facts of this case are virtually identical to the circumstances in United States v. Tisdale, 921 F.2d 1095 (10th Cir.1990), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 596, 116 L.Ed.2d 619 (1991).  Indeed, there are clear superficial similarities. In Tisdale, the burglar broke into three stores in one mall in one evening.  The Tenth Circuit held that breaking and entering of the three separate stores within the mall were burglaries of separate locations that could not occur simultaneously.  Moreover, concluded the court, because the defendant chose to continue his burglaries after successfully completing one, he had engaged in separate criminal episodes.  Id. at 1099.   The court\\'s rather terse treatment of the issue makes it difficult to assess with any accuracy whether the cases are similar beyond the fact that they both involve break-ins in a shopping mall in one evening.  It is not difficult to conceive of a situation in which the location of the stores to each other, the time involved, and the modus operandi would make it clear that more than one aggression took place.  Tisdale, therefore, may present, for purposes of the ACCA, a very different situation from the one before us.  If, on the other hand, it is factually indistinguishable from our case, I suggest that it cannot fit within the analysis that we carefully have developed over the years to identify recidivist behavior and to deal with it as Congress has mandated.  Here, the contiguous layout of the stores, the very short time involved in the execution of the entire plan, and the fact that the thieves treated the operation, both in its planning and its execution, as a unitary matter make it, for purposes of fulfilling the congressional intent, similar to the robbery of the six restaurant patrons in Petty.   It stretches both the English language and the realities of the situation to conclude that this situation was anything other than a single occasion.\\n\\n\\n82\\nToday, the court abandons the careful, thoughtful work-product of its past decisions in favor of an approach that, superficially, presents a more \"bright-line\" approach.  It does so at a great price--abandonment of the congressional mandate that the statute be used to identify the true recidivist and to treat that person differently because of the special danger that person poses to the rest of us.  The abandonment of our precedent is even more regrettable when one reflects on the future course of litigation in this area.  The majority appears to admit that the assailant who enters an apartment with an automatic weapon and shoots several people with one burst of his weapon is not subject to the provisions of this statute.  On the other hand, if he takes several steps around a room divider and shoots several others, the statute becomes operative because, at least in some metaphysical sense, he had time to think about the second pull of the trigger.  The crimes described above no doubt deserve severe punishment.  However, it is difficult to see, and Congress certainly did not intend, that one, but not the other, individual be treated as a recidivist.\\n\\n\\n83\\nBright-line mechanistic devices have a place in the law.  However, when Congress requires, as it clearly has here, that we distinguish between individuals committed to repetitive acts of violence and those who have not shown such a pattern in their lives, mechanistic tests may simplify the task, but they also make it a great deal less accurate.  Here the court has chosen the easy approach that also, undoubtedly, will bring more individuals within the ambit of the statute.  Our task, however, is not to stretch the statutory language, but to be responsive to the will of the Congress.  The majority has chosen a course that will not fulfill that objective.  Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\\n\\n\\n\\n*\\n The opinion was originally released in typescript\\n\\n\\n**\\n Judge Fairchild is participating in this en banc decision because he was a member of the three-judge panel which heard this case.  See Allen v. Johnson, 391 F.2d 527 (5th Cir.1968) (en banc )\\n\\n\\n***\\n When this case was orally argued and considered by the court on June 4, 1994, Judge Cudahy was in regular active service.  He participated in both the oral argument and the en banc conference.  He subsequently approved Judge Ripple\\'s opinion, then believed to be the prospective majority opinion, and filed a special concurrence supporting reversal of the judgment of the district court.  On August 15, 1994, Judge Cudahy attained senior status.  He has read United States v. American-Foreign S.S. Corp., 363 U.S. 685, 80 S.Ct. 1336, 4 L.Ed.2d 1491 (1960), interpreting 28 U.S.C. Sec. 371(b), as disqualifying him from further participation in this case because he had become a senior judge.  See Latin American Citizens Council v. Clements, 914 F.2d 620, 622 n. *  (5th Cir.1990) (en banc) (statement of Judge Reavley);  United States v. Anderson, 885 F.2d 1248, 1249 n. *  (5th Cir.1989) (en banc) (statement of Judge Rubin).  This view has now been confirmed by an opinion of this court, and Judge Cudahy has withdrawn his prior vote and special concurrence and is no longer a participant in this case\\n\\n\\n1\\n It is a federal crime for any person \"who has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;  ...  to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g)(1)\\n\\n\\n2\\n The penalty for violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g) in the absence of three prior violent felony convictions is imprisonment for not more than ten years.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(a)(2)\\n\\n\\n3\\n In Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 600-01, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2159-60, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), the Supreme Court limited sentencing courts in deciding whether an offense is a \"violent felony\" under the ACCA, to looking only at the statutory definition of the prior offense and not to the particular facts underlying the conviction.  However, Taylor does not preclude a sentencing court from examining the factual underpinnings of a defendant\\'s prior convictions in order that it might properly apply the ACCA and determine if multiple offenses occurred on one or more \"occasions.\"   As a practical matter, a district court frequently must look beyond the charging papers and judgment of conviction for these documents alone rarely provide the district court with the detailed information necessary (i.e., time, victim, location) to determine whether multiple offenses occurred on one or more \"occasions.\"   A district court\\'s examination of the factual basis for a defendant\\'s prior convictions does not amount to a retrial of those crimes as prohibited in Custis v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994).  The sentencing court is not being called upon to second-guess valid state court convictions, rather, it is merely determining whether the three valid convictions resulted from one occasion or more than one occasion.  Thus, the district court and this court have examined the police reports to accurately determine the facts of the three burglaries\\n\\n\\n4\\n Federal courts must give credence to state court convictions.  See Custis, --- U.S. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 1736 (\"prior convictions used for sentence enhancement purposes under Sec. 924(e) are not subject to collateral attack in the sentence proceeding\")\\n\\n\\n5\\n Hudspeth was arrested in the doughnut shop\\n\\n\\n6\\n According to United States v. Gallman, 907 F.2d 639, 643 (7th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 908, 111 S.Ct. 1110, 113 L.Ed.2d 219 (1991) and United States v. Redding, 16 F.3d 298, 302 (8th Cir.1994), under Sec. 924(e)(1), the government must establish that a defendant has three prior violent felony convictions.  A certified record of conviction or a presentence investigation report, if not challenged, will normally satisfy this showing.  Redding, 16 F.3d at 302;  United States v. Ruo, 943 F.2d 1274, 1276 (11th Cir.1991).  The burden then shifts to the defendant to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the prior convictions occurred on a single \"occasion,\" and thus cannot be the basis for sentence enhancement under Sec. 924(e)(1).  See Redding, 16 F.3d at 302 (defendant bears the burden of proving that prior convictions cannot be used for sentence enhancement)\\n\\n\\n7\\n While we realize that the issue in this appeal is whether the three burglaries occurred on one \"occasion\" or more than one \"occasion,\" it is interesting to note that these three burglaries are not the only offenses for which Hudspeth has been convicted.  The Presentence Report reveals that as a juvenile in 1975, Hudspeth was adjudicated delinquent on two counts of burglary, one count of theft and one count of using an intoxicant.  In 1979 as an adult, Hudspeth pled guilty to one count of theft and was sentenced to 60 days in jail and 30 months probation.  In 1980, while on probation from the 1979 conviction, he was charged with and pled guilty to one count of burglary and was sentenced to four years of incarceration.  In 1982, Hudspeth pled guilty to one count of trespassing and one count of resisting arrest.  He was fined $250.  Later in 1982, he was charged with and pled guilty to another count of resisting a peace officer and was sentenced to 30 days in jail.  In 1983, Hudspeth pled guilty to the three burglaries of the strip mall and was sentenced to four years of confinement.  Finally, in 1986, he was sentenced to two years of incarceration after pleading guilty to two counts of unlawful use of a firearm by a felon\\nIt is quite evident that Hudspeth is precisely the type of career criminal at whom the ACCA is directed.  Nonetheless, the mandatory fifteen-year minimum sentence applies only if Hudspeth\\'s three burglaries in 1983 are determined to have been \"committed on occasions different from one another\" because, other than his 1980 burglary conviction, his other prior offense was an adjudication of juvenile delinquency, which does not count under the ACCA unless it involved a violent felony.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e)(2)(C).\\n\\n\\n8\\n The three burglaries on March 27, 1983, occurred at three separate addresses:  Farmers Insurance Company was at 1810 Stevenson Drive, Melo Creme Doughnut was located at 1814 Stevenson Drive, and Homestyle Cleaners was at 1816 Stevenson Drive.  Presumably each business owner paid separate rent and taxes and filed separate insurance claims for the damage Hudspeth caused.  See Tisdale, 921 F.2d at 1099 (\"[t]he fact each incident occurred inside one enclosed structure [a mall] does not alter our conclusion that the crimes were committed at different locations \") (emphasis added)\\n\\n\\n9\\n The police reports reveal that Hudspeth and his two accomplices entered the first business establishment at approximately 7:20 p.m. and the police officers apprehended the burglars at approximately 7:55 p.m. while they were in the process of burglarizing a fourth business\\n\\n\\n10\\n For instance a single drug sale may result in a multiple count indictment charging a defendant with (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute narcotics (21 U.S.C. Sec. 846);  (2) possession with intent to distribute narcotics (21 U.S.C. Sec. 841);  (3) possession of a firearm during commission of a drug offense (18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(c)(1));  (4) sale of narcotics within 1000 feet of a school (21 U.S.C. Sec. 860);  and (5) involving a person under 18 years of age in a drug transaction (21 U.S.C. Sec. 861)\\n\\n\\n11\\n The police reports do not establish with any certainty the sequence of the burglaries or the precise means of entry.  However, for the purposes of this appeal, the order of and methods used to effect each entry are immaterial;  regardless of order, the second and third burglaries were committed sequentially to one another\\n\\n\\n12\\n Chief Judge Posner asked at oral argument whether the court should impose different sentences for the burglar who breaks into three houses that are separated by six inches of airspace and the burglar who breaks into three row houses that share a wall.  Clearly, enhancing the sentence of one of these burglars and not the other would lead to an absurd result.  The true inquiry is whether the crimes were committed in succession to one another.  A defendant who commits three crimes sequentially will have made three distinct and deliberate choices to commit a crime.  Hudspeth clearly committed three sequential crimes against three separate victims in three separate locations\\nJudge Bauer presented another hypothetical at oral argument to clarify the Schieman standard.  He inquired of the Assistant U.S. Attorney (\"AUSA\") if a gunman entered a room and murdered seven people in the room whether that was one occasion or seven occasions.  The AUSA, relying on United States v. Petty, 828 F.2d 2 (8th Cir.1987), responded that it would probably be one occasion.  Judge Bauer inquired further if the gunman entered seven different rooms and murdered one person in each room whether that constituted one occasion or seven occasions for purposes of the ACCA.  The AUSA argued that situation constituted seven occasions because the intervening time as the gunman marched from room to room permitted him to determine whether to cease or continue with his murderous spree.\\n\\n\\n13\\n Resort to legislative history is usually selective and thus of little value if any when interpreting a statute.  See Holder v. Hall --- U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2581, 2612, 129 L.Ed.2d 687 (1994) (legislative history \"is read selectively to support the result the Court intends to achieve\") (Thomas, J., concurring);  see also Conroy v. Aniskoff, --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 1562, 1567, 123 L.Ed.2d 229 (1993) (\"The greatest defect of legislative history is its illegitimacy.  We are governed by laws, not by the intentions of legislators....  If one were to search for an interpretive technique that, on the whole, was more likely to confuse than to clarify, one could hardly find a more promising candidate than legislative history.\")  (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment) (emphasis added)\\n\\n\\n14\\n A number of circuit courts have held that the language of Sec. 924(e)(1) is unambiguous in that a defendant\\'s conviction for one predicate offense need not precede the commission of the next predicate offense to trigger sentence enhancement under the ACCA.  See United States v. Anderson, 921 F.2d 335, 339-40 (1st Cir.1990) (\"we view the plain language of the statute ... as dispositive\");  United States v. Mason, 954 F.2d 219, 221-22 (4th Cir.1991) (\"[w]e do not agree that the statute is ambiguous\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1979, 118 L.Ed.2d 578 (1992);  United States v. Mitchell, 932 F.2d 1027, 1028 (2d Cir.1991) (per curiam ) (\"this language unambiguously requires that a defendant\\'s three convictions stem from three, separate criminal episodes ... [and] does not require that a defendant\\'s three criminal acts be punctuated by intervening convictions\")\\n\\n\\n15\\n The Eighth Circuit subsequently reconsidered its decision in Petty, and concluded that Petty\\'s six convictions for robbery occurred on a single \"occasion\" under the ACCA.  United States v. Petty, 828 F.2d 2, 3 (8th Cir.1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1057, 108 S.Ct. 2827, 100 L.Ed.2d 928 (1988)\\n\\n\\n16\\n The plain meaning of the term \"occasion\" incorporates a temporal distinction, i.e., one occasion cannot be simultaneous with another occasion.  Black\\'s Law Dictionary defines an occasion as a \"particular time.\"   Webster\\'s Third New International Dictionary defines an occasion as \"a particular time at which something takes place:  a time marked by some happening.\"   See also Tisdale, 921 F.2d at 1099 (\"[a] plain reading of the statutory language of Sec. 924(e)(1), \\'occasions different from one another\\', supports the conclusion that Congress intended the three predicate offenses to be distinct in time\")\\n\\n\\n17\\n Hudspeth also argues that the government violated his right to due process in that he received inadequate notice of the offenses on which his enhanced sentence was based.  The Supreme Court has held that a defendant must \"receive reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard relative to [any] recidivist charge.\"  Oyler v. Boles, 368 U.S. 448, 452, 82 S.Ct. 501, 504, 7 L.Ed.2d 446 (1962).  Hudspeth\\'s contention that the notice he received was not \"reasonable\" is unsupported by the record.  The Information Charging Prior Offenses, which was filed eighteen days after the return of the indictment and twenty-three days before Hudspeth signed the plea agreement, gave Hudspeth adequate notice of the prior convictions on which the government based its request for an enhanced sentence.  Hudspeth\\'s argument that he received inadequate notice is altogether without merit\\n\\n\\n*\\n But is this such a bright line after all--or does it simply substitute one ambiguity for another?   Consider the burglar who enters a home and pilfers the television from the family room, the candlesticks from the living room, and some jewelry from the bedroom.  Has he acted simultaneously or sequentially?   Clearly he cannot grab all of these objects with one clean scoop of the arm (nor could one acting without the benefit of specialized equipment or a contortionist\\'s talents rob or shoot six victims at precisely the same instant), and the proper characterization of the burglar\\'s acts will turn on how much time we will tolerate between so-called \"simultaneous\" occurrences\\n\\n\\n1\\n See North Georgia Finishing, Inc. v. Di-Chem, Inc., 419 U.S. 601, 615, 95 S.Ct. 719, 726, 42 L.Ed.2d 751 (1975) (Blackmun, J., dissenting)\\n\\n\\n2\\n Mr. Hudspeth was sentenced on November 26, 1991.  The court determined that the total offense level was 31;  the criminal history category was V;  the range of imprisonment was 180-210 months;  the range of supervised release was 3-5 years;  and the range of fine was $15,000 to $150,000.  It then sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of 180 months\\n\\n\\n3\\n In the unpublished order, this court also stated that it could not determine whether Mr. Hudspeth\\'s adjudication of delinquency in 1975, a juvenile burglary conviction, was a \"violent felony\" that would count for the purposes of Sec. 924(e).  At the hearing on remand, the government acknowledged that it would offer no evidence with respect to that adjudication.  R.59 at 9-10.  The government further commented that there was \"no contest\" as to the second item listed in the information, the adult conviction for burglary in May 1979.  Id\\n\\n\\n4\\n The charge of burglary to which Mr. Hudspeth pled guilty is a class 2 felony in Illinois.  720 ILCS 5/19-1.  Because that state statute has been found to be broader than the generic definition of burglary found in Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2158, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), the sentencing court is required to review the charging paper and jury instructions to determine whether all the elements of generic burglary are present.  Id.; United States v. Howell, 37 F.3d 1197, 1206-07 (7th Cir.1994);  United States v. Simpson, 974 F.2d 845, 849 (7th Cir.1992), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 1326, 122 L.Ed.2d 711 (1993).  Nothing in the record indicates that the district court examined those papers from state court.  However, the defendant did not raise this issue before the district court, nor does he raise it on appeal.  It is not critical to our decision for two reasons.  First, it may be that \"trial counsel obtained the charging papers, recognized that they satisfy Taylor, and saw no point in insisting that the record be padded with evidence adverse to his client.\"  United States v. Davenport, 986 F.2d 1047, 1050 (7th Cir.1993);  see also United States v. Davis, 16 F.3d 212, 215 n. 4 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 354, 130 L.Ed.2d 309 (1994) (No. 93-9130).  Second, the charging papers and certificates of judgment were presented in evidence to the district court at the resentencing proceeding, and they clearly fulfill the Taylor requirements\\n\\n\\n5\\n As the government noted at oral argument, the record simply does not reveal the precise sequence of the burglaries.  The police reports, Government\\'s Exhibit 2, were submitted at the resentencing hearing on February 1, 1993.  Mr. Hudspeth maintains that he and his confederates entered through the doughnut shop.  He was apprehended in this space.  The government claims that the cleaners was the point of entry.  The reports of Officers Wubker, Pisarek and Avart, who were on the scene of the burglary, state that the rear door of the cleaning establishment had been pried open and that the door was ajar.  None of the officers observed their entry.  Officer M. Laughlin, the only one to see the three men in the alley, stated:\\nI observed two white males standing in a far northwest corner of Laketown Shopping Center.  Another white male came from the east, or front, parking area of Laketown and walked up to the other two white males in the northwest corner behind a garbage dumpster.  I watched the three suspects crouching, stand up and look around, and croutch [sic] again.  A few moments later, the three white males walked out of the shadow area and walked to the next rear door south and croutched [sic] again.  I checked the parking lot area for a moment, when I looked back, all three white males had disappeared.\\nThe report of Officer Rachford, who arrived at the shopping center after two of the three were in custody, stated:\\nActual entry into the building was through the back door to the doughnut shop.  The back door to the laundry was standing open, but it was opened from the inside because it cannot be opened from the outside.\\nThere are other discrepancies in the reports.  Officer Wubker reported that three officers kicked open the back door to the cleaners;  Officer Avart, however, stated that he \"started to ease the door open gently.  As the door started to open, the R/A then  felt a resistance as though someone was on the other side of the door ready to shut it.  The R/A then forced the door open, announced, \\'halt police\\' and proceeded into the building followed by S/A Wubker and Officer Pisarek.\"   Also, several summaries stated that tools were lying on the floor of the cleaners, but Officer Pisarek \"observed several tools in the businesses.\"   Detective Rachford\\'s statement specifically mentioned that \"[t]here was no evidence in the Insurance Agency or Doughnut Shop, but in the laundromat R/D recovered several pieces of evidence\" which he then listed.  Neither party presses before us these factual ambiguities and we do not have the benefit of a judicial finding by the district court with respect to the matter.\\n\\n\\n6\\n Mr. Hudspeth raised the double jeopardy issue in his sentencing memorandum, filed the day before the resentencing hearing.  The memorandum asserted that double jeopardy prohibited resentencing, but did not move explicitly to dismiss the case on that ground.  The district court proceeded to recalculate Mr. Hudspeth\\'s sentence without adjudicating his double jeopardy claim.  Its decision to continue with the resentencing proceeding is impliedly a denial of the defendant\\'s request for dismissal\\n\\n\\n7\\n At the resentencing hearing, the government did submit to the district court copies of the state charging papers and judgments of conviction.  There is no record whether the evidence was before the court at the first sentencing hearing\\n\\n\\n8\\n The Supreme Court granted certiorari in Bohlen v. Caspari, 979 F.2d 109 (8th Cir.1992), cert. granted, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2958, 125 L.Ed.2d 660 (1993), on the question whether the Double Jeopardy Clause, which prohibits the state from subjecting a defendant to successive capital sentencing proceedings, applies to successive noncapital sentence enhancement proceedings.  However, because the Court resolved the case on Teague grounds, it did not answer the double jeopardy issues.  Caspari v. Bohlen, --- U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 948, 957, 127 L.Ed.2d 236 (1994)\\nI note that, in Caspari, the state was required to prove the existence of the predicate offense beyond a reasonable doubt.  Therefore, arguably, the existence of the offense was an element of the state conviction.  In the case of the ACCA, the predicate conviction is not an element of the offense and the government is not required to prove its existence beyond a reasonable doubt.\\n\\n\\n9\\n \"No claim is made here that recidivist statutes are themselves unconstitutional, nor could there be under our cases....  Such statutes ... have been sustained in this Court on several occasions against contentions that they violate constitutional strictures dealing with double jeopardy.\"  Spencer, 385 U.S. at 559-60, 87 S.Ct. at 651\\n\\n\\n10\\n In Denton we held that the Indiana recidivist statute does not impose additional punishment for a past crime but rather imposes additional punishment for the later crime and therefore does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause\\n\\n\\n11\\n \"[W]hether punishments are in fact multiple and violative of the Double Jeopardy Clause involves first a task of ascertaining legislative intent.\"  Vigil, 818 F.2d at 741 (citing Ohio v. Johnson, 467 U.S. 493, 499, 104 S.Ct. 2536, 2540-41, 81 L.Ed.2d 425 (1984);  Missouri v. Hunter, 459 U.S. 359, 368-69, 103 S.Ct. 673, 679-80, 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983);  Whalen v. United States, 445 U.S. 684, 688-89, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1435-36, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980))\\n\\n\\n12\\n In Pleasant the Eleventh Circuit noted that the application of a recidivist statute is not additional punishment for an earlier crime, but a recognition that the repetition of criminal conduct aggravates the commission of the later crime and warrants imposition of the longer sentence\\n\\n\\n13\\n In Bowdach the Fifth Circuit reiterated that enhancement is not punishment for earlier crime but additional punishment for later crimes because it has been aggravated by the earlier crime\\n\\n\\n14\\n Under the Arkansas scheme, the state has the burden of proving the existence of the predicate conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.  Arguably, therefore, it is an element of the offense and its proof implicates, for that reason, the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Because the state did not question the applicability of the double jeopardy clause to its recidivist statute, the Court assumed that it was applicable.  See Nelson, 488 U.S. at 37-38 n. 6, 109 S.Ct. at 289 n. 6\\n\\n\\n15\\n In the present case, the government did not attempt at the resentencing to introduce any new material in aggravation, but merely \"unbundled\" the 1983 convictions previously before the court\\n\\n\\n16\\n Section 924(e)(1) of the ACCA establishes the requisites for a fifteen-year minimum sentence:\\nIn the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title and has three previous convictions by any court ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another, such person shall be fined not more than $25,000 and imprisoned not less than fifteen years[.]\\n\\n\\n17\\n Mandatory minimum sentences implement the ACCA\\'s policy of \"selective incapacitation,\" the purpose of which is to \"select\" a particular class of offenders for \"incapacitation\" or long incarceration.  James E. Hooper, Note, Bright Lines, Dark Deeds:  Counting Convictions Under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 89 Mich.L.Rev.1951, 1953 (1991)\\nTo the extent that the criminal justice system identifies some criminals as unresponsive to rehabilitative treatment or deterrence, and expects them to offend again, the case for incapacitating them--denying them the opportunity to commit crimes by locking them up for long periods of time--is especially strong.  If the government cannot expect to change these criminals\\' behavior, it can at least isolate them and thereby protect society from their future crimes.\\nId. at 1953-54 (collecting articles concerning selective incapacitation policy).\\n\\n\\n18\\n See United States v.

LANIER.\\nNo. 95-1717.\\nSupreme Court of the United States\\nArgued Jan. 7, 1997.\\nDecided March 31, 1997.\\n\\n\\nSyllabus\\n*\\n\\nRespondent Lanier was convicted under 18 U.S.C. §242 of criminally violating the constitutional rights of five women by assaulting them sexually while he served as a state judge.  The jury had been instructed, inter alia, that the Government had to  prove as an element of the offense that Lanier had deprived the victims of their Fourteenth Amendment due process right to liberty, which included the right to be free from sexually motivated physical assaults and coerced sexual battery.  The en banc Sixth Circuit set aside the convictions for lack of any notice to the public that §242 covers simple or sexual assault crimes.  Invoking general interpretive canons and Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 89 L.Ed. 1495 (plurality opinion), the court held that §242 criminal liability  may be imposed only if the constitutional right said to have been violated is first identified in a decision of this Court, and only when the right has been held to apply in a factual situation \"fundamentally similar\\'\\' to the one at bar.  The court regarded these combined requirements as substantially higher than the \"clearly established\\'\\' standard used to judge qualified immunity  in civil cases under 42 U.S.C. §1983.\\nHeld: The Sixth Circuit employed the wrong standard for determining whether particular conduct falls within the range of criminal liability under §242.  Section 242\\'s general language prohibiting \"the deprivation of any rights  . . .  secured  . . . by the Constitution\\'\\' does not describe the specific conduct it forbids, but-like its companion conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. §241-incorporates constitutional law by reference.  Before criminal liability may be imposed for violation of any penal law, due process requires \"fair warning  . . .  of what the law intends.\\'\\' McBoyle v. United States, 283 U.S. 25, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340, 341, 75 L.Ed. 816.  The touchstone is whether the statute, either standing alone or as construed by the courts, made it reasonably clear at the time of the charged conduct that the conduct was criminal.  Section 242 was construed in light of this due process requirement in Screws, supra. The Sixth Circuit erred in adding as a gloss to this standard the requirement that a prior decision of this Court have declared the constitutional right at issue in a factual situation \"fundamentally similar\\'\\' to the one at bar.  The Screws plurality referred in general terms to rights made specific by \"decisions interpreting\\'\\' the Constitution, see 325 U.S., at 104, 65 S.Ct., at 1037; no subsequent case has confined the universe of relevant decisions to the Court\\'s opinions; and the Court has specifically referred  to Court of Appeals decisions in defining the established scope of a constitutional right under §241, see Anderson v. United States, 417 U.S. 211, 223-227, 94 S.Ct. 2253, 2261-2264, 41 L.Ed.2d 20, and in enquiring whether a right was \"clearly established\\'\\' when applying the qualified immunity rule under §1983 and Bivens v. Six Unknown Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619, see, e.g., Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 533, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 2819, 86 L.Ed.2d 411.  Nor has this Court demanded precedents applying the right at issue to a \"fundamentally similar\\'\\' factual situation at the level of specificity meant by the Sixth Circuit.  Rather, the Court has upheld convictions under §241 or §242 despite notable factual distinctions between prior cases and the later case, so long as the prior decisions gave reasonable warning that the conduct at issue violated constitutional rights.  See, e.g., United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745, 759, n. 17, 86 S.Ct. 1170, n. 17, 1179, 16 L.Ed.2d 239. The Sixth Circuit\\'s view that due process under  §242 demands more than the \"clearly established\\'\\' qualified immunity test under §1983 or Bivens is error.  In effect that test is simply the adaptation of the fair warning standard to give officials (and, ultimately, governments) the same protection from civil liability and its consequences that individuals have traditionally possessed in the face of vague criminal statutes.   As with official conduct under §1983 or Bivens, liability may be  imposed under §242 if, but only if, in the light of pre-existing  law the unlawfulness of the defendant\\'s conduct is apparent.  Pp. ____-____.\\n73 F.3d 1380 (C.A.6 1996), vacated and remanded.\\nSOUTER, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\\nSeth Waxman, for Petitioner.\\nAlfred H. Knight, Nashville, TN, for Respondent.\\nJustice SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n\\n\\n1\\nRespondent David Lanier was convicted under 18 U.S.C. §242 of criminally violating the constitutional rights of five women by assaulting them sexually while Lanier served as a state judge. The Sixth Circuit reversed his convictions on the ground that the constitutional right in issue had not previously been identified by this Court in a case with fundamentally similar facts.  The question is whether this standard of notice is higher than the Constitution requires, and we hold that it is.\\n\\n\\n2\\n* David Lanier was formerly the sole state Chancery Court judge for two rural counties in western Tennessee.  The trial record, read most favorably to the jury\\'s verdict, shows that from 1989 to 1991, while Lanier was in office, he sexually assaulted several women in his judicial chambers.  The two most serious assaults were against a woman whose divorce proceedings had come before Lanier and whose daughter\\'s custody remained subject to his jurisdiction.  When the woman applied for a secretarial job at Lanier\\'s courthouse, Lanier interviewed her and suggested that he might have to reexamine the daughter\\'s custody.  When the woman got up to leave, Lanier grabbed her, sexually assaulted her, and finally committed oral rape.  A few weeks later, Lanier inveigled the woman into returning to the courthouse again to get information about another job opportunity, and again sexually assaulted and orally raped her.   App. 44-67.  On five other occasions Lanier sexually assaulted four other women: two of his secretaries, a Youth Services Officer of the juvenile court over which Lanier presided, and a local coordinator for a federal program who was in Lanier\\'s chambers to discuss a matter affecting the same court. Id., at 13-43, 67-109.\\n\\n\\n3\\nUltimately, Lanier was charged with 11 violations of §242, each count of the indictment alleging that, acting willfully and under color of Tennessee law, he had deprived the victim of \"rights and privileges which are secured and protected by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, namely the right not to be deprived of liberty without due process of law, including the right to be free from wilful sexual assault.\\'\\' Id., at 5-12.  Before trial, Lanier moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that §242 is void for vagueness.  The District Court denied the motion.\\n\\n\\n4\\nThe trial judge instructed the jury on the Government\\'s burden to prove as an element of the offense that the defendant deprived the victim of rights secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States:\\n\\n\\n5\\n\"Included in the liberty protected by the [Due Process Clause      of the] Fourteenth Amendment is the concept of personal      bodily integrity and the right to be free of unauthorized and      unlawful physical abuse by state intrusion.  Thus, this      protected right of liberty provides that no person shall be      subject to physical or bodily abuse without  lawful      justification by a state official acting or claiming  to act      under the color of the laws of any state of the United States      when that official\\'s conduct is so demeaning and harmful      under all the circumstances as to shock one\\'s consci[ence].      Freedom from such physical abuse includes the right to be      free from certain sexually motivated physical assaults and      coerced sexual battery.  It is not, however, every      unjustified touching or grabbing by a state official that      constitutes a violation of a person\\'s constitutional rights.      The physical abuse must be of a serious substantial nature      that involves physical force, mental coercion, bodily injury      or emotional damage which is shocking to one\\'s      consci[ence].\\'\\' Id., at 186-187.\\n\\n\\n6\\nThe jury returned verdicts of guilty on seven counts, and not guilty on three (one count having been dismissed at the close of the Government\\'s evidence).  It also found that the two oral rapes resulted in \"bodily injury,\\'\\' for which Lanier was subject  to 10-year terms of imprisonment on each count, in addition to 1-year terms under the other five counts of conviction, see §242.   He was sentenced to consecutive maximum terms totaling 25 years.\\n\\n\\n7\\nA panel of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the convictions and sentence, 33 F.3d 639 (1994), but the full Court vacated that decision and granted rehearing en banc, 43 F.3d 1033 (1995).  On rehearing, the Court set aside Lanier\\'s convictions for \"lack of any notice to the public that this ambiguous criminal statute [i.e., §242] includes simple or sexual assault crimes within its coverage.\\'\\' 73 F.3d 1380, 1384 (1996). Invoking general canons for interpreting criminal statutes, as well as this Court\\'s plurality opinion in Screws v.  United States, 325 U.S. 91, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 89 L.Ed. 1495 (1945),  the Sixth Circuit held that criminal liability may be imposed under §242 only if the constitutional right said to have been violated is first identified in a decision of this Court (not any other federal, or state, court), and only when the right has been held to apply in \"a factual situation fundamentally similar to the one at bar.\\'\\' 73 F.3d, at 1393.  The Court of Appeals regarded these combined requirements as \"substantially higher than the \"clearly established\\' standard used to judge qualified immunity\\'\\' in civil cases under Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U.S.C. §1983. 73 F.3d, at 1393.  Finding no decision of this Court applying a right to be free from unjustified assault or invasions of bodily integrity in a situation \"fundamentally similar\\'\\' to those charged, the Sixth Circuit reversed the judgment of conviction with instructions to dismiss the indictment.  Two judges would not have dismissed the felony counts charging the oral rapes but concurred in dismissing the misdemeanor counts, while three members of the court dissented as to all dismissals.\\n\\n\\n8\\nWe granted certiorari to review the standard for determining whether particular conduct falls within the range of criminal liability under §242. 518 U.S. ____, 116 S.Ct. 2522, 135 L.Ed.2d 1047 (1996).  We now reverse.\\n\\nII\\n\\n9\\nSection 242 is a Reconstruction Era civil rights statute making it criminal to act (1) \"willfully\\'\\' and (2) under color of law (3) to deprive a person of rights protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States.1 18 U.S.C. §242; Screws v. United States, supra. The en banc decision of the Sixth Circuit dealt only with the last of these elements, and it is with that element alone that we are concerned here.2\\n\\n\\n10\\nThe general language of §242,3 referring to \"the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States,\\'\\' is matched by the breadth of its companion conspiracy statute, §241,4 which speaks of conspiracies to prevent \"the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to [any person] by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\\'\\'  Thus, in lieu of describing the specific conduct it forbids, each statute\\'s general terms incorporate constitutional law by reference, see United States v. Kozminski, 487 U.S. 931, 941, 108 S.Ct. 2751, 2759, 101 L.Ed.2d 788 (1988); United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787, 797, 805, 86 S.Ct. 1152, 1158-1159, 1162-1163, 16 L.Ed.2d 267 (1966), and many of the incorporated constitutional guarantees are, of course, themselves stated with some catholicity of phrasing.  The result is that neither the statutes nor a good many of their constitutional referents delineate the range of forbidden conduct with particularity.\\n\\n\\n11\\nThe right to due process enforced by §242 and said to have been violated by Lanier presents a case in point, with the irony that a prosecution to enforce one application of its spacious protection of liberty can threaten the accused with deprivation of another: what Justice HOLMES spoke of as \"fair warning  . . . in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.  To make the warning fair, so far as possible the line should be clear.\\'\\' McBoyle v. United States, 283 U.S. 25, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340, 341, 75  L.Ed. 816 (1931). \"\"The  . . .  principle is that no man shall be held criminally responsible for conduct which he could not reasonably understand to be proscribed.\\'\\'\\' Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347, 351, 84 S.Ct. 1697, 1701, 12 L.Ed.2d 894  (1964) (quoting United States v. Harriss, 347 U.S. 612, 617, 74 S.Ct. 808, 811-812, 98 L.Ed. 989 (1954)).5\\n\\n\\n12\\nThere are three related manifestations of the fair warning requirement.  First, the vagueness doctrine bars enforcement of \"a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.\\'\\' Connally v. General Constr. Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S.Ct. 126, 127, 70 L.Ed. 322 (1926); accord Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 1858, 75 L.Ed.2d 903 (1983); Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 453, 59 S.Ct. 618,  619, 83 L.Ed. 888 (1939).  Second, as a sort of \"junior version of the vagueness doctrine,\\'\\' H. Packer, The Limits of the Criminal Sanction 95 (1968), the canon of strict construction of  criminal statutes, or rule of lenity, ensures fair warning by so  resolving ambiguity in a criminal statute as to apply it only to  conduct clearly covered.  See, e.g., Liparota v. United States, 471 U.S. 419, 427, 105 S.Ct. 2084, 2089, 85 L.Ed.2d 434 (1985); United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 347-348, 92 S.Ct. 515, 522-523, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971); McBoyle, supra, at 27, 51 S.Ct., at 341.  Third, although clarity at the requisite level may be supplied by judicial gloss on an otherwise uncertain statute, see, e.g., Bouie, supra, at 357-359, 84 S.Ct., at 1704-1706; Kolender, supra, at 355-356, 103 S.Ct., at 1856-1858; Lanzetta, supra, at 455-457, 59 S.Ct., at 619-621; J. Jeffries, Legality, Vagueness, and the Construction of Penal Statutes, 71 Va. L.Rev.  189, 207 (1985), due process bars courts from applying a novel construction of a criminal statute to conduct that neither the statute nor any prior judicial decision has fairly disclosed to be within its scope, see, e.g., Marks v. United States, 430 U.S.  188, 191-192, 97 S.Ct. 990, 992-993, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977); Rabe  v. Washington, 405 U.S. 313, 92 S.Ct. 993, 31 L.Ed.2d 258 (1972); Bouie, supra, at 353-354, 84 S.Ct., at 1702-1703; cf.  U.S. Const.  Art. I, §9, cl. 3; id., §10, cl. 1; Bouie, supra, at 353-354, 84 S.Ct., at 1702-1703 (Ex Post Facto Clauses bar legislatures from making substantive criminal offenses retroactive).  In each of these guises, the touchstone is whether the statute, either standing alone or as construed, made it reasonably clear at the relevant time that the defendant\\'s conduct was criminal.\\n\\n\\n13\\nWe applied this standard in Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 89 L.Ed. 1495 (1945), which recognized that the expansive language of due process that provides a basis  for judicial review is, when incorporated by reference into §242, generally ill-suited to the far different task of giving fair warning about the scope of criminal liability.  The Screws plurality identified the affront to the warning requirement posed by employing §242 to place \"the accused  . . .  on trial for an offense, the nature of which the statute does not define and hence of which it gives no warning.\\'\\' Id., at 101, 65 S.Ct., at 1035. At the same time, the same Justices recognized that this constitutional difficulty does not arise when the accused is charged with violating a \"right which has been made specific either by the express terms of the Constitution or laws of the United States or by decisions interpreting them.\\'\\' Id., at 104, 65 S.Ct., at 1037.  When broad constitutional requirements have been \"made specific\\'\\' by the text or settled interpretations, willful violators \"certainly are in no position to say that they  had no adequate advance notice that they would be visited with punishment . . . . -[T]hey are not punished for violating an unknowable something.\\'\\' Id., at 105, 65 S.Ct., at 1037.  Accordingly, Screws limited the statute\\'s coverage to rights fairly warned of, having been \"made specific\\'\\' by the time of the charged conduct.  See also Kozminski, supra, at 941, 108 S.Ct., at 2759 (parallel construction of §241).6\\n\\n\\n14\\nThe Sixth Circuit, in this case, added two glosses to the made-specific standard of fair warning.  In its view, a generally phrased constitutional right has been made specific within the meaning of Screws only if a prior decision of this Court has declared the right, and then only when this Court has applied its ruling in a case with facts \"fundamentally similar\\'\\' to the case being prosecuted. 73 F.3d at 1393.  None of the considerations advanced in this case, however, persuades us that either a decision of this Court or the extreme level of factual specificity envisioned by the Court of Appeals is necessary in every instance to give fair warning.\\n\\n\\n15\\nFirst, contrary to the Court of Appeals, see ibid., we think it unsound to read Screws as reasoning that only this Court\\'s decisions could provide the required warning.  Although the Screws plurality gave two examples involving decisions of the Court, their opinion referred in general terms to rights made specific by \"decisions interpreting\\'\\' the Constitution, see 325 U.S., at 104, 65 S.Ct., at 1037 (plurality opinion), and no subsequent case has held that the universe of relevant interpretive decisions is confined to our opinions.  While United States v. Kozminski, 487 U.S. 931, 108 S.Ct. 2751, 101 L.Ed.2d 788 (1988), a case under §241 for violating Thirteenth Amendment rights, did characterize our task as ascertaining the crime charged \"by looking to the scope of the Thirteenth Amendment prohibition  . . .  specified in our prior decisions,\\'\\' id., at 941, 108 S.Ct., at 2759, in at least one other case we have specifically referred to a decision of a Court of Appeals in defining the established scope of a constitutional right for purposes of §241 liability, see Anderson v. United States, 417 U.S. 211, 223-227, 94 S.Ct. 2253, 2261-2264, 41 L.Ed.2d 20 (1974). It is also to the point, as we explain below, that in applying the rule of qualified immunity under 42 U.S.C. §1983 and Bivens v. Six Unknown Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), we have referred to decisions of the Courts of Appeals when enquiring whether a right was \"clearly established.\\'\\'  See Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 533, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 2819, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985); Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 191-192, 104 S.Ct. 3012, 3017-3018, 82 L.Ed.2d 139 (1984); see also id., at 203-205, 104 S.Ct., at 3023-3025 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); Elder v. Holloway, 510 U.S. 510, 516, 114 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 127 L.Ed.2d 344 (1994) (treating Court of Appeals decision as \"relevant authority\\'\\' that must be considered as part of qualified immunity enquiry).  Although the Sixth Circuit was concerned, and rightly  so, that disparate decisions in various Circuits might leave the  law insufficiently certain even on a point widely considered, such a circumstance may be taken into account in deciding whether the warning is fair enough, without any need for a categorical rule that decisions of the Courts of Appeals and other courts are inadequate as a matter of law to provide it.\\n\\n\\n16\\nNor have our decisions demanded precedents that applied the right at issue to a factual situation that is \"fundamentally similar\\'\\' at the level of specificity meant by the Sixth Circuit in using that phrase.  To the contrary, we have upheld convictions under §241 or §242 despite notable factual distinctions between the precedents relied on and the cases then  before the Court, so long as the prior decisions gave reasonable  warning that the conduct then at issue violated constitutional rights.  See United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745, 759 n. 17, 86  S.Ct. 1170, 1179 n. 17, 16 L.Ed.2d 239 (1966) (prior cases established right of interstate travel, but later case was the first to address the deprivation of this right by private persons); United States v. Saylor, 322 U.S. 385, 64 S.Ct. 1101, 88 L.Ed. 1341 (1944) (pre-Screws; prior cases established right to have legitimate vote counted, whereas later case involved dilution of legitimate votes through casting of fraudulent ballots); United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 321-324, 61 S.Ct. 1031, 1040-1042, 85 L.Ed. 1368 (1941) (pre-Screws; prior cases established right to have vote counted in general election, whereas later case involved primary election); see also Screws, supra, at 106, 65 S.Ct., at 1037-1038 (stating that Classic met the test being announced).\\n\\n\\n17\\nBut even putting these examples aside, we think that the Sixth Circuit\\'s \"fundamentally similar\\'\\' standard would lead trial judges to demand a degree of certainty at once unnecessarily high and likely to beget much wrangling.  This danger flows from the Court of Appeals\\' stated view, 73 F.3d, at  1393, that due process under §242 demands more than the \"clearly  established\\'\\' law required for a public officer to be held civilly liable for a constitutional violation under §1983 or Bivens, see Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 107 S.Ct. 3034,  97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987) (Bivens action); Davis v. Scherer, supra, at 183, 104 S.Ct., at 3012 (§1983 action).  This, we think, is error.\\n\\n\\n18\\nIn the civil sphere, we have explained that qualified immunity seeks to ensure that defendants \"reasonably can anticipate when their conduct may give rise to liability,\\'\\' id., at 195, by attaching liability only if \" [t]he contours of the right [violated are] sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right,\\'\\' Anderson, supra, at 640, 107 S.Ct., at 3039.  So conceived, the object of the \"clearly established\\'\\' immunity standard is not different from that of \"fair warning\\'\\' as it relates to law \"made specific\\'\\' for the purpose of validly applying §242.  The fact that one has a civil and the other a criminal law role is of no significance; both serve the same objective, and in effect the qualified immunity test is simply the adaptation of the fair warning standard to give officials (and, ultimately, governments) the same protection from civil liability and its consequences that individuals have traditionally possessed in the face of vague criminal statutes.   To require something clearer than \"clearly established\\'\\' would, then, call for something beyond \"fair warning.\\'\\'\\n\\n\\n19\\nThis is not to say, of course, that the single warning standard points to a single level of specificity sufficient in every instance.  In some circumstances, as when an earlier case expressly leaves open whether a general rule applies to the particular type of conduct at issue, a very high degree of prior factual particularity may be necessary.  See, e.g., Mitchell v. Forsyth, supra, at 530-535, and n. 12, 105 S.Ct., at 2817-2820, and n. 12.  But general statements of the law are not inherently incapable of giving fair and clear warning, and in other instances a general constitutional rule already identified in the decisional law may apply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in question, even though \"the very action in question has [not] previously been held unlawful,\\'\\' Anderson, supra, at 640, 107 S.Ct., at 3039.  As Judge Daughtrey noted in her dissenting opinion in this case, \"\"[t]he easiest cases don\\'t even arise. There has never been  . . .  a section 1983 case accusing welfare officials of selling foster children into slavery; it does not follow that if such a case arose, the officials would be immune from damages [or criminal] liability.\\'\\'\\' 73 F.3d, at 1410 (quoting K.H. Through Murphy v. Morgan, 914 F.2d 846, 851 (C.A.7  1990)); see also Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U.S. 104, 110, 92 S.Ct.  1953, 1957, 32 L.Ed.2d 584 (1972) (due process requirements are not \"designed to convert into a constitutional dilemma the practical difficulties in drawing criminal statutes both general  enough to take into account a variety of human conduct and sufficiently specific to provide fair warning that certain kinds  of conduct are prohibited\\'\\'); Williams v. United States, 341 U.S. 97, 101, 71 S.Ct. 576, 579, 95 L.Ed. 774 (1951) (holding that beating to obtain a confession plainly violates §242).  In sum, as with civil liability under §1983 or Bivens, all that can usefully be said about criminal liability under §242 is that it may be imposed for deprivation of a constitutional right if, but  only if, \"in the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness [under the Constitution is] apparent,\\'\\' Anderson, supra, at 640,  107 S.Ct., at 3039. Where it is, the constitutional requirement  of fair warning is satisfied.\\n\\n\\n20\\nBecause the Court of Appeals used the wrong gauge in deciding whether prior judicial decisions gave fair warning that respondent\\'s actions violated constitutional rights, we vacate the judgment and remand for application of the proper standard.7\\n\\n\\n21\\n\\nIt is so ordered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*\\n The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.  See United States v. Detroit Timber & Lumber Co., 200 U.S. 321, 337, 26 S.Ct. 282, 287, 50 L.Ed. 499.\\n\\n\\n1\\n The present §242 has its roots in portions of three Reconstruction Era Civil Rights Acts, whose substantive criminal provisions were consolidated in a single section in 1874.  See 2 Cong. Rec. 827-828 (1874) (describing derivation of consolidated criminal civil rights law from §§1 and 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27; §§16 and 17 of the Civil Rights Act of 1870, 16 Stat. 144; and §1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13).  Although those statutory forebears created criminal sanctions only for violations of some enumerated rights and privileges, the consolidated statute of 1874 expanded the law\\'s scope to apply to deprivations of all constitutional rights, despite the \"customary stout assertions of the codifiers that they had merely clarified and reorganized without changing substance.\\'\\' United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787, 803, 86 S.Ct. 1152, 1161, 16 L.Ed.2d 267 (1966).  Since the 1874 recodification, Congress has revisited §242 on several occasions, without contracting its substantive scope.

The Sixth Circuit discussed that issue only in the original panel opinion, subsequently vacated, but did not reach the question in the en banc decision under review here. To the extent the issue remains open, we leave its consideration in the first instance to the Court of Appeals on remand.\\n\\n\\n3\\n \" Whoever, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, willfully subjects any person in any State, Territory, or District to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or to different punishments, pains, or penalties, on account of such person being an alien, or by reason of his color, or race, than are prescribed for the punishment of citizens,\\'\\' shall be subject to specified criminal penalties.\\n\\n\\n4\\n Insofar as pertinent: \"If two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any State, Territory, or District in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having so exercised the same,\\'\\' they shall be subject to specified criminal penalties.\\n\\n\\n5\\n The fair warning requirement also reflects the deference due to the legislature, which possesses the power to define crimes and their punishment.  See United States v. Wiltberger, 18 U.S. 76, 5 Wheat. 76, 95, 5 L.Ed. 37 (1820); United States v. Aguilar, 515 U.S. ____, ____, 115 S.Ct. 2357, 2362, 132 L.Ed.2d 520 (1995) (slip op., at 5-6).  See generally H. Packer, The Limits of the Criminal Sanction 79-96 (1968) (discussing \"principle of legality,\\'\\' \"that conduct may not be treated as criminal unless it has been so defined by [a competent] authority  . . .  before it has taken place,\\'\\' as implementing separation of powers, providing notice, and preventing abuses of official discretion) (quotation at 80); J. Jeffries, Legality, Vagueness, and the Construction of Penal Statutes, 71 Va. L.Rev. 189 (1985).\\n\\n\\n6\\n This process of \"making specific\\'\\' does not, as the Sixth Circuit believed, qualify Screws as \"the only Supreme Court case in our legal history in which a majority of the Court seems [to have been] willing to create a common law crime.\\'\\' 73 F.3d, 1380, 1391 (1996).  Federal crimes are defined by Congress, not the courts, Kozminski, 487 U.S., at 939, 108 S.Ct., at 2757-2758; United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat., at 95, 5 L.Ed. 37, and Screws did not \"create a common law crime\\'\\'; it narrowly construed a broadly worded act of Congress, and the policies favoring strict construction of criminal statutes oblige us to carry out congressional intent as far as the Constitution will admit, see Kozminski, supra, at 939, 108 S.Ct., at 2757-2758; Huddleston v. United States, 415 U.S. 814, 831, 94 S.Ct. 1262, 1271-1272, 39 L.Ed.2d 782 (1974); United States v. Morris, 39 U.S. 464, 14 Pet. 464, 475, 10 L.Ed. 543 (1840).  Nor is §242\\'s pedigree as an act of Congress tainted by its birth at the hands of codifiers who arguably made substantive changes in the pre-existing law, see n. 1, supra, as the Sixth Circuit concluded from the statutory history, 73 F.3d, at 1384-1387.  The legislative intent of Congress is to be derived from the language and structure of the statute itself, if possible, not from the assertions of codifiers directly at odds with clear statutory language.  See, e.g., United States v. Wells, 519 U.S. ____, ____, 117 S.Ct. 921, ____, ___ L.Ed.2d ____, (1997) (slip op., at 14-16).  Further, the Sixth Circuit\\'s conclusion that Congress never intended §242 to extend to \"newly-created constitutional rights,\\'\\' 73 F.3d, at 1387, is belied by the fact that Congress has increased the penalties for the section\\'s violation several times since Screws was decided, without contracting its substantive scope, see n. 1, supra.\\n\\n\\n7\\n We also leave consideration of other issues that may remain open to the Court of Appeals on remand.  Several of the arguments tendered by respondent here are, however, plainly without merit and need not be left open.  First, Lanier\\'s contention that Screws excluded rights protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from the ambit of §242 is contradicted by the language of Screws itself as well as later cases.  See Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 100, 106, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 1034-1035, 1037-1038, 89 L.Ed. 1495 (1945); United States v. Price, 383 U.S., at 789, and n. 2, 793, 86 S.Ct., at 1154, and n. 2, 1156 (§242 is enforcement legislation enacted under §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment and encompasses violations of rights guaranteed under the Due Process Clause).  Second, although DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989), generally limits the constitutional duty of officials to protect against assault by private parties to cases where the victim is in custody, DeShaney does not hold, as respondent maintains, that there is no constitutional right to be free from assault committed by state officials themselves outside of a custodial setting.  Third, contrary to respondent\\'s claim, Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 394, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1870-1871, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989), does not hold that all constitutional claims relating to physically abusive government conduct must arise under either the Fourth or Eighth Amendments; rather, Graham simply requires that if a constitutional claim is covered by a specific constitutional provision, such as the Fourth or Eighth Amendment, the claim must be analyzed under the standard appropriate to that specific provision, not under the rubric of substantive due process.\\n\\n\\n'}]\n",

      "[{'63 F.3d 332': '63 F.3d 332\\nUNITED STATES of America, Plaintiff-Appellee,v.Vincent Jay LETTERLOUGH, Defendant-Appellant.\\nNo. 94-5571.\\nUnited States Court of Appeals,Fourth Circuit.\\nArgued June 8, 1995.Decided Aug. 28, 1995.\\n\\nARGUED:  Richard Allen Elmore, Pfaff, Elmore & Hayes, Greensboro, NC, for appellant.  Michael Francis Joseph, Asst. U.S. Atty., Greensboro, NC, for appellee.  ON BRIEF:  Walter C. Holton, Jr., U.S. Atty., Greensboro, NC, for appellee.\\nBefore HAMILTON, LUTTIG, and WILLIAMS, Circuit Judges.\\nAffirmed by published opinion.  Judge WILLIAMS wrote the opinion, in which Judge HAMILTON and Judge LUTTIG joined.\\nOPINION\\nWILLIAMS, Circuit Judge:\\n\\n\\n1\\nThis case presents the straightforward question of whether Vincent Letterlough committed three crimes \"on occasions different from one another\" under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C.A. Sec. 924(e)(1) (West Supp.1995),1 as implemented through U.S.S.G.2  Sec. 4B1.4.  We affirm the armed career criminal enhancement imposed by the district court, and in doing so, join our sister circuits to conclude that the occasion test of Sec. 924(e)(1) is satisfied so long as each charged crime is a \"separate and distinct criminal episode.\"\\n\\nI.\\n\\n2\\nThe facts of this case are not in dispute.  After an acquaintance purchased a firearm for Letterlough, she realized that Letterlough was a convicted felon.  This caused the acquaintance to have second thoughts and turn herself in to the police.  As a result, Letterlough was indicted for and pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. Sec. 922(g) (West Supp.1995) on November 10, 1993.  During sentencing, the Probation Officer recommended considering Letterlough an Armed Career Criminal under the ACCA\\'s statutory sentencing enhancement, over the objection of the Government, based on the following three drug convictions:  (1) a conviction for selling a single dose of crack cocaine to an undercover police officer for $20 at 8:35 p.m. on July 31, 1990, when Letterlough was 17 years old;  (2) a conviction for selling another single dose of crack cocaine at the same location to the same police officer on the same day in July 1990 at 10:15 p.m.;   and (3) a conviction for the felony sale of cocaine on March 29, 1990.  Letterlough challenged the application of the armed career criminal statute to him, on the basis that the two drug sales on July 31, 1990, were not \"committed on occasions different from one another\" as required by Sec. 924(e)(1).  Because they were not committed on occasions different from one another, Letterlough argued that he did not possess the three requisite convictions necessary for the enhancement.  The Government joined in Letterlough\\'s objection.\\n\\n\\n3\\nNevertheless, on July 21, 1994, the district court denied Letterlough\\'s and the Government\\'s objections to the enhancement, and, taking into account Letterlough\\'s substantial assistance, sentenced Letterlough to 84 months imprisonment, 5 years supervised release, and a special assessment.3  Letterlough timely filed a notice of appeal.\\n\\nII.\\n\\n4\\nAs stated above, the sole question raised in this appeal is whether Letterlough\\'s two July 31, 1990, convictions were \"committed on occasions different from one another.\"   Because this is a question of statutory interpretation, we review the district court\\'s conclusions de novo.  See United States v. Brady, 988 F.2d 664, 666 (6th Cir.)  (en banc) (\"Brady presents a legal question concerning the interpretation of a statute, a matter we review de novo.\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 166, 126 L.Ed.2d 126 (1993).\\n\\n\\n5\\nThe ACCA is a sentencing enhancement intended to punish recidivism.  See United States v. Towne, 870 F.2d 880, 890-91 (2d Cir.)  (\"It seems quite clear that this section of the Act was intended to target recidivists.\"), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1101, 109 S.Ct. 2456, 104 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1989);   Brady, 988 F.2d at 670 (Jones, J., dissenting) (\"With the Armed Career Criminal Act, Congress enacted legislation which imposes a mandatory minimum sentence for recidivists.\")  (citation omitted).  In accord with this purpose, when a defendant is convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g), the ACCA directs the district court to look at the defendant\\'s criminal history, and, if appropriate, increase his sentence from the otherwise normal ten year maximum under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(a)(2) to within a mandatory minimum range of fifteen years to life.  18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e)(1) & (2).  A defendant is eligible for the enhancement if, prior to his conviction for violating Sec. 922(g), he \"has three previous convictions ... for a violent felony or serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e)(1).\\n\\n\\n6\\nWhen Congress originally enacted Sec. 924(e)(1), the phrase \"committed on occasions different from one another\" was not part of Sec. 924(e)(1).   United States v. Blackwood, 913 F.2d 139, 146 (4th Cir.1990);  see 18 U.S.C. app. Sec. 1202(a) (repealed and recodified in 1986 at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924).  The Eighth Circuit\\'s decision in  United States v. Petty4 changed that.  In  Petty, Petty\\'s criminal history consisted of six criminal convictions for robbing six people simultaneously.  Petty argued that because all of his convictions were obtained through one simultaneous act, the enhancement should not apply.  The Eighth Circuit decided that the requisite three criminal convictions for the enhancement were satisfied because Petty could have been prosecuted under separate indictments notwithstanding the fact that the six convictions arose from the same act.   Id. at 1159-60.   The Supreme Court granted certiorari, but before argument, the Solicitor General changed the government\\'s position, claiming that \"Congress intended the statute to enhance punishment for multiple criminal episodes that were distinct in time, as opposed to multiple convictions arising out of a single criminal episode.\"   Blackwood, 913 F.2d at 146 (discussing  Petty and the legislative history of the ACCA).  The Supreme Court remanded the case for reconsideration in light of the Solicitor General\\'s changed position.   Petty v. United States, 481 U.S. 1034, 107 S.Ct. 1968, 95 L.Ed.2d 810 (1987).\\n\\n\\n7\\nIn response to this controversy, in 1988, Congress added the phrase above to Sec. 924(e)(1) to require that the three predicate offenses take place \"on occasions different from one another.\"   See Blackwood, 913 F.2d at 146.   Obviously, this amendment encompasses the  Petty situation--where the defendant commits multiple criminal acts simultaneously.  However, the plain language of the statute indicates that Congress intended a broader meaning.  Congress\\'s use of the word \"occasion\" implies that it intended the offenses underlying the predicate convictions to be distinct from one another.  \"Occasion\" has been defined as \"a particular occurrence ... a particular time at which something takes place.\"   Webster\\'s Third New International Dictionary Unabridged 1560 (1986).  This common sense definition tells us that Congress intended to include within the scope of the ACCA only those predicate offenses that can be isolated with a beginning and an end--ones that constitute an occurrence unto themselves.\\n\\n\\n8\\nReflecting the importance of defining each conviction as a separate event, almost every circuit5 in the country applies the following test to determine whether the ACCA applies to a defendant\\'s prior crimes:  Convictions occur on occasions different from one another \"if each of the prior convictions arose out of a \\'separate and distinct criminal episode.\\' \"   United States v. Hudspeth, 42 F.3d 1015, 1019 (7th Cir.1994) (en banc) (collecting cases) (emphasis in original) (citation omitted), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 2252, 132 L.Ed.2d 260 (1995).  We, too, believe that this formulation properly articulates the need for self-contained predicate offenses under Sec. 924(e)(1), and adopt it as our own.\\n\\n\\n9\\nHowever, although this definition may be clear, the factual permutations surrounding the ACCA tend to create havoc.  As a result, courts have applied a multiplicity of factors to determine when more than one conviction constitutes a separate and distinct criminal episode.  For example, courts have asked whether the offenses arose in different geographic locations;6 whether  the nature of the offenses was substantively different;7 and whether the offenses involved multiple victims8 or multiple criminal objectives.9  For instance, in  United States v. Ressler, 54 F.3d 257, 260 (5th Cir.1995), the defendant\\'s criminal acts occurred within a span of several hours;  however, they were different crimes (burglary and assault) committed against different victims.  As a result, the court determined that the acts were separate and distinct episodes.   Id.  Courts have applied these factors independently, or in conjunction, to decide that a defendant\\'s similar offenses are actually separate and distinct from one another.10  In essence, if any one of the factors has a strong presence, it can dispositively segregate an extended criminal enterprise into a series of separate and distinct episodes.\\n\\n\\n10\\nSeveral courts have addressed situations, similar to the instant case, where defendants have claimed that their prior criminal acts took place on one occasion because they were committed within an extremely short time span.  In  Hudspeth, the Seventh Circuit, en banc, recently concluded that the defendant was eligible for the Armed Career Criminal enhancement when his three previous felonies were committed as one continuous criminal scheme that took place over the course of an hour.  42 F.3d at 1022.   Almost a decade before his conviction under Sec. 922(g), Hudspeth and several others broke into a donut shop in a mall through its back door, burglarized it, then broke through the donut shop\\'s wall to the adjacent store, a dry cleaners, and then broke into the next adjacent store, an insurance company.  The Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court\\'s application of the ACCA, using these three burglaries as predicate convictions.  The court held that the enhancement should be applied against \"criminals who commit separate crimes against different individuals while on a spree, within a short period of time, provided that the perpetrator had the opportunity to cease and desist from his criminal actions.\"   Id. at 1020.\\n\\n\\n11\\nIn  United States v. Antonie, 953 F.2d 496 (9th Cir.1991), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 138, 121 L.Ed.2d 91 (1992), the Ninth Circuit affirmed an enhancement under similar circumstances.  As succinctly stated by the court, \"Antonie robbed a 7-11 market in Downy, California at 9:45 p.m. and a Winchell\\'s Donut House in Bellflower, California at 10:25 p.m.\"   Id. at 498.   Based on these facts, the district court refused to apply the enhancement, the government appealed, and the Ninth Circuit reversed.  The court, relying on precedent from its interpretation of Sec. 924(e)(1)\\'s predecessor statute, held that the enhancement was appropriate so long as the predicate crimes were \"distinct in time.\"   Id. (quoting  United States v. Wicks, 833 F.2d 192, 194 (9th Cir.1987), cert. denied 488 U.S. 831, 109 S.Ct. 87, 102 L.Ed.2d 63 (1988)).\\n\\n\\n12\\nParticularly instructive because of its similar facts is  United States v. Washington, 898 F.2d 439 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 842, 111 S.Ct. 122, 112 L.Ed.2d 91 (1990), where the Fifth Circuit affirmed the Sec. 924(e)(1) enhancement.  Washington had committed two robberies several years before being convicted under Sec. 922(g).  First, he robbed a convenience store in Jackson, Mississippi, on October 13, 1979, at approximately 11:30 p.m.  Several hours later, he returned to the very same store and robbed it again.  In short, he \"committed [his two robberies] within a period of a few hours against the same victim at the same location.\"   Id. at 440.   Nevertheless, the court concluded:  \"Washington\\'s two robberies were separate criminal episodes because he committed the first, completed it, and escaped;  then, after a few hours of no criminal activity, Washington returned to commit the second crime.\"   Id. at 442.   The court held that \"[w]here ... multiple offenses are not part of a continuous course of conduct, they cannot be said to constitute either a criminal spree or a single criminal transaction for purposes of section 924(e),\"  id. at 441, therefore, an ACCA enhancement was appropriate.  We agree with this analysis, and believe that it reinforces the lessons of  Hudspeth and  Antonie.\\n\\n\\n13\\nLetterlough argues that we should consider his two sales \"a continuous drug transaction.\"   Brief of Appellant at 10.  We disagree.  In our opinion, Letterlough\\'s two drug sales, although perhaps occurring pursuant to a master plan to sell crack cocaine as a business venture, can hardly be said to constitute a single occasion.  If we went into a drug store to purchase aspirin, the transaction would be complete once we left the store with the pills--even though the drug store was still open for business.  Similarly, each of Letterlough\\'s drug sales was a complete and final transaction, and therefore, an independent offense.  Once Letterlough sold the first dose, as far as we know, he engaged in no criminal activity for over an hour and a half, at which point he chose to engage in another separate and distinct criminal transaction.  The time separating the offenses was ample to give Letterlough the opportunity to make a conscious and knowing decision to engage in another drug sale.  Unlike the situation where the defendant assaults and kidnaps someone in an extended attack,  Towne, 870 F.2d at 891, Letterlough\\'s two sales were \"not part of a continuous course of [criminal] conduct.\"   Washington, 898 F.2d at 441.\\n\\n\\n14\\nWe also cannot conclude that these two sales constituted a single occasion because the undercover officer to whom the drugs were sold chose not to arrest Letterlough after the first sale.  Although Letterlough would like to assign some culpability for the second sale to the undercover officer who purchased the drugs, the responsibility for the crime falls squarely on Letterlough.  We cannot disregard the additional criminal activity simply because the government allowed Letterlough to engage in it.  To do so would force officers to arrest all evildoers as soon as they see a crime committed;  it would destroy large scale police \"sting\" operations and undercover infiltrations, as were present in this case.\\n\\n\\n15\\nIn short, we find Letterlough\\'s two July 1990 convictions did not arise from a continuous course of criminal conduct;  rather, they constituted two complete and discrete commercial transactions and, therefore, two separate and distinct episodes.  Accordingly, because Letterlough\\'s three convictions were committed \"on occasions different from one another,\" his sentence was properly enhanced.\\n\\n\\n16\\nAFFIRMED.\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n We recently upheld the constitutionality of the ACCA on Commerce Clause, Equal Protection Clause, Due Process Clause, Double Jeopardy Clause, \"Ex Post Facto\" Clause, and Eighth Amendment grounds.  See United States v. Presley, 52 F.3d 64, 67-68 (4th Cir.1995)\\n\\n\\n2\\n United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (Nov. 1993)\\n\\n\\n3\\n Without the substantial assistance, Letterlough would have been subject to a mandatory minimum penalty under the ACCA of at least 15 years in prison, resulting in a guidelines range of 180-210 months.  Without the enhancement or the departure for substantial assistance, Letterlough\\'s maximum sentence would have been 96 months\\n\\n\\n4\\n 798 F.2d 1157 (8th Cir.1986), vacated and remanded, 481 U.S. 1034, 107 S.Ct. 1968, 95 L.Ed.2d 810, rev\\'d on remand, 828 F.2d 2 (8th Cir.1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1057, 108 S.Ct. 2827, 100 L.Ed.2d 928 (1988)\\n\\n\\n5\\n After our decision, the D.C.

Argued February 23, 2010—Decided May 24, 2010\\nRespondents O’Brien and Burgess each carried a firearm during an\\n  attempted robbery. Count three of their indictment charged them\\n  with using a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, which car\\n  ries a mandatory minimum 5-year prison term.                18 U. S. C.\\n  §924(c)(1)(A)(i). Count four alleged use of a machinegun (here, a pis\\n  tol that authorities believed operated as a fully automatic firearm) in\\n  furtherance of that crime, which carries a 30-year mandatory mini\\n  mum term. §924(c)(1)(B)(ii).

Pp. 5–16.\\n    (a) Generally, a fact that “increase[s] the prescribed range of penal\\n ties to which a criminal defendant is exposed” is an element of a\\n\\x0c2                      UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\\n\\n                                   Syllabus\\n\\n    crime, Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490, to be charged in\\n    an indictment and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, Ham\\n    ling v. United States, 418 U. S. 87, 117, rather than proved to a judge\\n    at sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence, McMillan v. Penn\\n    sylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 91−92. Subject to this constitutional con\\n    straint, Congress determines whether a factor is an element or a sen\\n    tencing factor. When Congress is not explicit, courts look to a\\n    statute’s provisions and framework for guidance. Analysis of the cur\\n    rent machinegun provision begins with Castillo, where the Court\\n    found the bare language of §924’s prior version “neutral,” 530 U. S.,\\n    at 124, but ruled that four factors—(1) language and structure, (2)\\n    tradition, (3) risk of unfairness, and (4) severity of the sentence—\\n    favored treating the machinegun provision as an element of an of\\n    fense, id., at 124−131; while a fifth factor—legislative history—did\\n    not favor either side, ibid. Pp. 5–6.\\n       (b) As relevant here, the 1998 amendment divided what was once a\\n    lengthy principal sentence into separate subparagraphs. Thus, with\\n    regard to the first Castillo factor, the Court’s observation that “Con\\n    gress placed the element ‘uses or carries a firearm’ and the word ‘ma\\n    chinegun’ in a single sentence, not broken up with dashes or sepa\\n    rated into subsections,” 530 U. S., at 124−125, no longer holds true.\\n    However, the amendment did not affect the second through fifth Cas\\n    tillo factors. Each of them, except for legislative history (which re\\n    mains relatively silent), continues to favor treating the machinegun\\n    provision as an element. The amendment’s effect on the language\\n    and structure factor requires closer examination. Pp. 6–12.\\n       (c) Given the Court’s determination in Castillo that the machine\\n    gun provision in §924’s prior version is an element, a substantive\\n    change in the statute should not be inferred “[a]bsent a clear indica\\n    tion from Congress of a change in policy,” Grogan v. Garner, 498 U. S.\\n    279, 290. Nothing in the 1998 amendment indicates such a change.\\n    There are three principal differences between the previous and cur\\n    rent §924(c). The first, a substantive change, shifts what were once\\n    mandatory 5-year and 30-year sentences to mandatory minimum\\n    sentences. The second, also substantive—made in direct response to\\n    the holding in Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, that “uses or\\n    carries” in §924’s preamendment version connotes “more than mere\\n    possession,” id., at 143—adds “possesses” to the “uses or carries” lan\\n    guage in §924(c)’s principal paragraph and provides sentencing en\\n    hancements for brandishing or discharging the firearm,\\n    §§924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and (iii), which do state sentencing factors, Harris v.\\n    United States, 536 U. S. 545, 552−556. Neither of these substantive\\n    changes suggests that Congress meant to transform the machinegun\\n    provision from an element into a sentencing factor. The third differ\\n\\x0c                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                     3\\n\\n                                Syllabus\\n\\n  ence is the machinegun provision’s relocation from the principal\\n  paragraph that unmistakably lists offense elements to a separate\\n  subsection, §924(c)(1)(B), but this structural or stylistic change pro\\n  vides no “clear indication” that Congress meant to alter its treatment\\n  of machineguns as an offense element. A more logical explanation is\\n  that the restructuring was intended to break up a lengthy principal\\n  paragraph, which exceeded 250 words, into a more readable statute,\\n  which is in step with current legislative drafting guidelines. While\\n  this Court has recognized that placing factors in separate subsections\\n  is one way Congress might signal that it is treating them as sentenc\\n  ing factors rather than elements, Castillo, supra, at 124−125, it has\\n  rejected the view that such a structural consideration predominates\\n  even when other factors point in the other direction, Harris, supra, at\\n  553. The current structure of §924(c) is more favorable to treating\\n  the machinegun provision as a sentencing factor than was true in\\n  Castillo, particularly because the machinegun provision is now posi\\n  tioned between the sentencing factors provided in (A)(ii) and (iii) and\\n  those in (C)(i) and (ii). This structural point is overcome by the sub\\n  stantial weight of the other Castillo factors and the principle that\\n  Congress would not enact so significant a change without a clear in\\n  dication of its purpose to do so.

This provision prohibits the\\nuse or carrying of a firearm in relation to a crime of vio\\nlence or drug trafficking crime, or the possession of a\\nfirearm in furtherance of such crimes. §924(c)(1)(A). A\\nviolation of the statute carries a mandatory minimum\\nterm of five years’ imprisonment, §924(c)(1)(A)(i); but if\\nthe firearm is a machinegun, the statute requires a 30\\nyear mandatory minimum sentence, §924(c)(1)(B)(ii).\\nWhether a firearm was used, carried, or possessed is, as\\nall concede, an element of the offense. At issue here is\\nwhether the fact that the firearm was a machinegun is an\\nelement to be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable\\ndoubt or a sentencing factor to be proved to the judge at\\nsentencing.\\n   In an earlier case the Court determined that an analo\\ngous machinegun provision in a previous version of §924\\nconstituted an element of an offense to be proved to the\\njury. Castillo v. United States, 530 U. S. 120 (2000). The\\nCastillo decision, however, addressed the statute as it\\n\\x0c2               UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\\n\\n                    Opinion of the Court\\n\\nexisted before congressional amendments made in 1998.\\nAnd in a case after Castillo, the brandishing provision in\\nthe post-1998 version of §924 was held to provide a sen\\ntencing factor, not an element of the offense. Harris v.\\nUnited States, 536 U. S. 545 (2002). In light of the 1998\\namendments and the Harris decision, the question of how\\nto interpret §924’s machinegun provision is considered\\nonce more in the instant case.\\n                              I\\n   On June 16, 2005, respondents Martin O’Brien and\\nArthur Burgess attempted to rob an armored car making a\\nscheduled delivery of cash to a bank. Along with a third\\ncollaborator, respondents hid in a minivan and waited for\\nthe armored car to make its stop. Each of the men carried\\na firearm. Containing nearly $2 million and attended by\\ntwo guards, the armored car arrived. A guard began to\\nunload boxes of coins. The three men came out of the van\\nand, while one of them brandished his weapon, they or\\ndered the guards to get on the ground. One guard did so,\\nbut the other ran to a nearby restaurant. The respondents\\nabandoned the robbery and fled without taking any\\nmoney. No shots were fired, and no one was injured.\\n   Authorities apprehended respondents and recovered the\\nthree firearms used during the attempted robbery. The\\nfirearms were a semiautomatic Sig-Sauer pistol, an\\nAK−47 semiautomatic rifle, and a Cobray pistol. The\\nCobray pistol had been manufactured as, and had the\\nexternal appearance of, a semiautomatic firearm. Accord\\ning to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, though, it\\noperated as a fully automatic weapon, apparently due to\\nsome alteration of its original firing mechanism. Respon\\ndents dispute whether the Cobray in fact did operate as a\\nfully automatic weapon.\\n   Respondents were indicted on multiple counts. Rele\\nvant here are counts three and four, both of which charged\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           3\\n\\n                     Opinion of the Court\\n\\noffenses under §924(c). Count three charged respondents\\nwith using a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence,\\nwhich carries a statutory minimum of five years’ impris\\nonment. Count four charged respondents in more specific\\nterms, alleging use of a machinegun (the Cobray) in fur\\ntherance of a crime of violence, as proscribed by\\n§§924(c)(1)(A) and (B)(ii). The latter provision mandates a\\nminimum sentence of 30 years’ imprisonment.\\n   The Government moved to dismiss count four on the\\nbasis that it would be unable to establish the count beyond\\na reasonable doubt. (The issues in the present case do not\\nrequire the Court to consider any contention that a defen\\ndant who uses, carries, or possesses a firearm must be\\naware of the weapon’s characteristics. This opinion ex\\npresses no views on the point.)\\n   The Government then maintained that the machinegun\\nprovision in §924(c)(1)(B)(ii) was a sentencing factor, so\\nthat, if respondents were convicted of carrying a firearm\\nunder count three, the court could determine at sentencing\\nthat the particular firearm was a machinegun, thus acti\\nvating the 30-year mandatory minimum. The District\\nCourt dismissed count four, as the Government requested,\\nbut rejected the Government’s position that the machine\\ngun provision was a sentencing enhancement to be deter\\nmined by the court at sentencing once there was a convic\\ntion on count three. It ruled that the machinegun\\nprovision states an element of a crime. Thus, to invoke\\nthe 30-year minimum sentence, the Government was\\nrequired to charge in the indictment, and then prove to\\nthe jury, that the Cobray was a machinegun.\\n   At this point, after the District Court foreclosed the\\npossibility of respondents’ facing a 30-year minimum,\\nrespondents pleaded guilty to the remaining counts, in\\ncluding count three. The      District   Court    sentenced\\nO’Brien to a 102-month term for his §924(c) conviction, to\\nrun consecutively with his sentence on two other counts.\\n\\x0c4                UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\\n\\n                     Opinion of the Court\\n\\nIt sentenced Burgess to an 84-month term for his §924(c)\\nconviction, also to run consecutively to his sentence on the\\nother charges. The Government appealed the District\\nCourt’s ruling that the §924 machinegun provision consti\\ntutes an element of an offense instead of a sentencing\\nfactor.\\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\\naffirmed. It looked primarily to Castillo, 530 U. S. 120,\\nwhich held that the machinegun provision in an earlier\\nversion of §924(c) constituted an element of an offense, not\\na sentencing factor. The court noted that the statute\\nunder consideration in Castillo had been revised by Con\\ngress, “break[ing] what was a single run-on sentence into\\nsubparagraphs,” and it acknowledged that the earlier\\nrepealed version of the statute was “slightly more favor\\nable to the [respondents] than the current version[,] but\\nnot markedly so.” 542 F. 3d 921, 925 (2008). It found “no\\nevidence that the breaking up of the sentence into the\\npresent subdivisions or recasting of language was any\\nthing more than a current trend—probably for ease of\\nreading—to convert lengthy sentences in criminal statutes\\ninto subsections in the fashion of the tax code.” Id., at\\n926. The court concluded: “Absent a clearer or more dra\\nmatic change in language or legislative history expressing\\na specific intent to assign judge or jury functions, we think\\nthat Castillo is close to binding,” and any reconsideration\\nof the issue should be left to this Court. Ibid.; see also\\nRodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc.,\\n490 U. S. 477, 484 (1989) (“If a precedent of this Court has\\ndirect application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons\\nrejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Ap\\npeals should follow the case which directly controls, leav\\ning to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own\\ndecisions”).\\n   We granted certiorari. 557 U.

Hamling\\nv. United States, 418 U. S. 87, 117 (1974); Jones v. United\\nStates, 526 U. S. 227, 232 (1999). Sentencing factors, on\\nthe other hand, can be proved to a judge at sentencing by\\na preponderance of the evidence. See McMillan v. Penn\\nsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 91−92 (1986). Though one excep\\ntion has been established, see Almendarez-Torres v.\\nUnited States, 523 U. S. 224, 228 (1998), “ ‘[i]t is unconsti\\ntutional for a legislature to remove from the jury the\\nassessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of\\npenalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed.’ ”\\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000) (quoting\\nJones, supra, at 252−253 (STEVENS, J., concurring)). In\\nother words, while sentencing factors may guide or confine\\na judge’s discretion in sentencing an offender “within the\\nrange prescribed by statute,” Apprendi, supra, at 481,\\njudge-found sentencing factors cannot increase the maxi\\nmum sentence a defendant might otherwise receive based\\npurely on the facts found by the jury.\\n   Subject to this constitutional constraint, whether a\\ngiven fact is an element of the crime itself or a sentencing\\nfactor is a question for Congress. When Congress is not\\nexplicit, as is often the case because it seldom directly\\naddresses the distinction between sentencing factors and\\nelements, courts look to the provisions and the framework\\nof the statute to determine whether a fact is an element or\\na sentencing factor. Almendarez-Torres, supra, at 228. In\\nexamining whether the machinegun provision in §924 is\\nan element or a sentencing factor, the analysis must begin\\nwith this Court’s previous examination of the question in\\nCastillo.\\n   In Castillo, the Court considered a prior version of §924,\\nwhich provided:\\n\\x0c6                UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\\n\\n                     Opinion of the Court\\n\\n       “(c)(1) Whoever, during and in relation to any crime\\n    of violence or drug trafficking crime . . . , uses or car\\n    ries a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment\\n    provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking\\n    crime, be sentenced to imprisonment for five years,\\n    and if the firearm is a short-barreled rifle [or a] short\\n    barreled shotgun to imprisonment for ten years, and if\\n    the firearm is a machinegun, or a destructive device,\\n    or is equipped with a firearm silencer or firearm muf\\n    fler, to imprisonment for thirty years. . . .” 18 U. S. C.\\n    §924(c)(1) (1988 ed., Supp. V).\\nIn determining whether the machinegun provision in the\\njust-quoted version of §924 constituted an element or a\\nsentencing factor, the Court in Castillo observed that the\\nbare statutory language was “neutral.” 530 U. S., at 124.\\nIt examined five factors directed at determining congres\\nsional intent: (1) language and structure, (2) tradition, (3)\\nrisk of unfairness, (4) severity of the sentence, and (5)\\nlegislative history. Id., at 124−131. The Court unani\\nmously concluded that the machinegun provision provided\\nan element of an offense, noting that the first four factors\\nfavored treating it as such while legislative history did not\\nsignificantly favor either side. Ibid.\\n                            III \\n\\n                             A\\n\\n  Section 924(c) was amended to its current form in 1998.\\nThe amendment had been enacted when the Court consid\\nered Castillo, supra, at 125, but the pre-1998 version of\\nthe statute was at issue there. The instant case concerns\\nthe post-1998 (and current) version of the statute, which\\nprovides:\\n      “(A) Except to the extent that a greater minimum\\n    sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or\\n    by any other provision of law, any person who, during\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 560 U.

S. C. §924(c)(1)\\n    (2006 ed.).\\n  The 1998 amendment did make substantive changes to\\nthe statute, to be discussed below; but for purposes of the\\npresent case the most apparent effect of the amendment\\nwas to divide what was once a lengthy principal sentence\\ninto separate subparagraphs. This Court’s observation in\\nconsidering the first Castillo factor, that “Congress placed\\nthe element ‘uses or carries a firearm’ and the word ‘ma\\nchinegun’ in a single sentence, not broken up with dashes\\nor separated into subsections,” 530 U. S., at 124−125, no\\nlonger holds true. Aside from this new structure, however,\\nthe 1998 amendment of §924 did nothing to affect the\\nsecond through fifth Castillo factors. Each of the factors,\\nexcept for legislative history (which, assuming its rele\\n\\x0c8                 UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\\n\\n                      Opinion of the Court\\n\\nvance, remains relatively silent), continues to favor the\\nconclusion that the machinegun provision is an element of\\nan offense.\\n   Legal tradition and past congressional practice are the\\nsecond Castillo factor. The factor is to be consulted when,\\nas here, a statute’s text is unclear as to whether certain\\nfacts constitute elements or sentencing factors. Sentenc\\ning factors traditionally involve characteristics of the\\noffender—such as recidivism, cooperation with law en\\nforcement, or acceptance of responsibility. Id., at 126.\\nCharacteristics of the offense itself are traditionally\\ntreated as elements, and the use of a machinegun under\\n§924(c) lies “closest to the heart of the crime at issue.” Id.,\\nat 127. This is no less true today than it was 10 years ago\\nin Castillo. Unsurprisingly, firearm type is treated as an\\nelement in a number of statutes, as “numerous gun crimes\\nmake substantive distinctions between weapons such as\\npistols and machineguns.” Ibid.; see, e.g., 18 U. S. C.\\n§§922(a)(4), 922(b)(4), and 922(o)(1).\\n   The Government counters that this tradition or pattern\\nhas evolved since the version of §924(c) under review in\\nCastillo was enacted. The Government contends that the\\nFederal Sentencing Guidelines altered the tradition by\\ntreating the possession of a firearm as a sentencing factor.\\nBrief for United States 23 (citing United States Sentenc\\ning Commission, Guidelines Manual §2K2.1(a)(5) (Nov.\\n1998) (raising base offense level “if the offense involved a\\nfirearm”)).\\n   The argument is not persuasive. The Sentencing Re\\nform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1987, establishing the Federal\\nSentencing Guidelines, was enacted four years before the\\nversion of §924 under review in Castillo, see Anti-Drug\\nAbuse Act of 1988, §6460, 102 Stat. 4373. While the re\\nsulting Guidelines were not effective until 1987, this was\\nstill before the 1988 enactment of the statute at issue in\\nCastillo, and 13 years before this Court’s conclusion in\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            9\\n\\n                     Opinion of the Court\\n\\nCastillo that firearm type is traditionally treated as an\\noffense element. The Government cannot claim the bene\\nfit of any shift in how the law traditionally treats firearm\\ntype from the Guidelines, for that supposed shift would\\nhave occurred before the 1988 version of §924 was en\\nacted. The Guidelines were explicitly taken into account\\nwhen this Court analyzed the traditions in Castillo. 530\\nU. S., at 126 (discussing Federal Sentencing Guidelines in\\ndetermining what traditionally qualifies as a sentencing\\nfactor).\\n   The third Castillo factor, potential unfairness, was\\nunchanged by the restructuring of §924. The Court ex\\nplained in Castillo that treating the machinegun provision\\nas a sentencing factor “might unnecessarily produce a\\nconflict between the judge and the jury” because “a jury\\nmay well have to decide which of several weapons” a\\ndefendant used. Id., at 128. The concern was that the\\njudge may not know which weapon the jurors determined\\na defendant used, and “a judge’s later, sentencing-related\\ndecision that the defendant used the machinegun, rather\\nthan, say, the pistol, might conflict with the jury’s belief\\nthat he actively used the pistol.” Ibid. This same concern\\narises under the current version of §924, where jurors\\nmight have to determine which among several weapons a\\ndefendant used, carried, or possessed in furtherance of a\\ncrime.\\n   The Government’s response, that permitting a judge to\\nmake this finding would “streamlin[e] guilt-stage proceed\\nings, without interfering with the accuracy of fact-finding,”\\nBrief for United States 33, is unconvincing. It does not\\naddress the particular unfairness concern expressed in\\nCastillo, which was not alleviated by the restructuring of\\n§924. And the Government does not suggest that it would\\nbe subjected to any unfairness if the machinegun provision\\ncontinues to be treated as an element.\\n   The fourth Castillo factor, the severity of the sentence\\n\\x0c10               UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\\n\\n                     Opinion of the Court\\n\\naccompanying a finding that a defendant carried a ma\\nchinegun under §924, was also unaffected by the statute’s\\nrestructuring. A finding that a defendant carried a ma\\nchinegun under §924, in contrast to some less dangerous\\nfirearm, vaults a defendant’s mandatory minimum sen\\ntence from 5 to 30 years, Castillo, supra, at 131, or from 7\\nto 30 years if, as in this case, the firearm was brandished,\\n§924(c)(1)(A)(ii). This is not akin to the “incremental\\nchanges in the minimum” that one would “expect to see in\\nprovisions meant to identify matters for the sentencing\\njudge’s consideration,” Harris, 536 U. S., at 554 (from 5\\nyears to 7 years); it is a drastic, sixfold increase that\\nstrongly suggests a separate substantive crime.\\n   There is one substantive difference between the old and\\nnew versions of §924 that might bear on this fourth factor.\\nThe previous version of §924 provided mandatory sen\\ntences: 5 years for using or carrying a firearm and 30\\nyears if the firearm is a machinegun, for example. See\\n§924(c)(1) (1988 ed., Supp. V). The current statute pro\\nvides only mandatory minimums: not less than 5 years for\\nusing or possessing a firearm; not less than 7 for brandish\\ning it; and not less than 30 if the firearm is a machinegun.\\n§§924(c)(1)(A)(i), (A)(ii), (B)(ii). The Government argues\\nthat this difference is critical because a 30-year sentence\\nis conceivable under the statute even without a finding\\nthat the particular weapon is a machinegun. Brief for\\nUnited States 25.\\n   This is a distinction in theory, perhaps, but not in prac\\ntice. Neither the Government nor any party or amicus has\\nidentified a single defendant whose conviction under §924\\nfor possessing or brandishing a nonspecific firearm led to a\\nsentence approaching the 30-year sentence that is re\\nquired when the firearm is a machinegun. Respondents\\nadvise, without refutation, that most courts impose the\\nmandatory minimum of 7 years’ imprisonment for bran\\ndishing a nonspecific weapon and the longest sentence\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 560 U.

Brief for Respondent O’Brien 46, 48 (citing\\nUnited States v. Batts, 317 Fed. Appx. 329 (CA4 2009) (per\\ncuriam)); see also Harris, supra, at 578 (THOMAS, J.,\\ndissenting). Indeed, in the instant case, Burgess received\\nthe statutory minimum 7-year sentence, and O’Brien\\nreceived only 18 months more than that. Once the ma\\nchinegun enhancement was off the table, the Government\\nitself did not seek anything approaching 30-year terms,\\ninstead requesting 12-year terms for each respondent.\\n   The immense danger posed by machineguns, the moral\\ndepravity in choosing the weapon, and the substantial\\nincrease in the minimum sentence provided by the statute\\nsupport the conclusion that this prohibition is an element\\nof the crime, not a sentencing factor. It is not likely that\\nCongress intended to remove the indictment and jury trial\\nprotections when it provided for such an extreme sentenc\\ning increase. See Jones, 526 U. S., at 233 (“It is at best\\nquestionable whether the specification of facts sufficient to\\nincrease a penalty range by two-thirds, let alone from 15\\nyears to life, was meant to carry none of the process safe\\nguards that elements of an offense bring with them for a\\ndefendant’s benefit”). Perhaps Congress was not con\\ncerned with parsing the distinction between elements and\\nsentencing factors, a matter more often discussed by the\\ncourts when discussing the proper allocation of functions\\nbetween judge and jury. Instead, it likely was more fo\\ncused on deterring the crime by creating the mandatory\\nminimum sentences. But the severity of the increase in\\nthis case counsels in favor of finding that the prohibition is\\nan element, at least absent some clear congressional indi\\ncation to the contrary.\\n   The fifth factor considered in Castillo was legislative\\nhistory, and the Court there found it to be of little help.\\n530 U. S., at 130 (“Insofar as this history may be relevant,\\nhowever, it does not significantly help the Government”).\\n\\x0c12               UNITED STATES v.

Brief for United\\nStates 29; Brief for Respondent O’Brien 28−29. This\\nsilence is not neutral, however, because as explained\\nbelow, it tends to counsel against finding that Congress\\nmade a substantive change to this statutory provision.\\n   Four of the five factors the Court relied upon in Castillo\\npoint in the same direction they did 10 years ago. How\\nthe 1998 amendment affects the remaining factor—the\\nprovision’s language and structure—requires closer\\nexamination.\\n                              B\\n   In Castillo, the Court interpreted §924(c) in its original\\nversion, though Congress had at that point already\\namended the provision. Here, the applicable principle is\\nthat Congress does not enact substantive changes sub\\nsilentio. See Director of Revenue of Mo. v. CoBank ACB,\\n531 U. S. 316, 323 (2001). In light of Castillo’s determina\\ntion that the machinegun provision in the previous version\\nof §924 is an element, a change should not be inferred\\n“[a]bsent a clear indication from Congress of a change in\\npolicy.” Grogan v. Garner, 498 U. S. 279, 290 (1991); see\\nalso Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., 511 U. S. 298, 313, n.\\n12 (1994) (“[W]hen this Court construes a statute, it is\\nexplaining its understanding of what the statute has\\nmeant continuously since the date when it became law”).\\n   The Government argues that the 1998 amendment\\nrestructuring §924(c) demonstrates the congressional\\njudgment to reclassify the machinegun provision as a\\nsentencing factor, rather than as an offense element. But\\nthe better understanding, as the Government acknowl\\nedged in its submission in Castillo, is that “there is noth\\ning to suggest that the 1998 amendments were intended to\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          13\\n\\n                     Opinion of the Court\\n\\nchange, rather than simply reorganize and clarify, [§924]’s\\ntreatment of firearm type.” Brief for United States, O. T.\\n1999, No. 99–658, p. 41. A closer review of the 1998\\namendment confirms this.\\n  There are three principal differences between the previ\\nous and current versions of §924(c): two substantive\\nchanges and a third regarding the stylistic structure of the\\nstatute. The first difference, as discussed above, supra, at\\n10, is that the amendment changed what were once man\\ndatory sentences into mandatory minimum sentences. A\\nperson convicted of the primary offense of using or carry\\ning a firearm during a crime of violence was once to “be\\nsentenced to imprisonment for five years,” but under the\\ncurrent version he or she is to “be sentenced to a term of\\nimprisonment of not less than 5 years.”\\n  The second difference is that the amended version in\\ncludes the word “possesses” in addition to “uses or carries”\\nin its principal paragraph, and then adds the substantive\\nprovisions in §§924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and (iii), which provide\\nmandatory minimums for brandishing (7 years) and dis\\ncharging (10 years) the firearm. These provisions are new\\nsubstantive additions to the text of the previous version,\\nwhich provided a bare 5-year mandatory minimum for any\\noffender who “use[d] or carrie[d] a firearm,” without con\\ncern for how the firearm was used.\\n  The changes were a direct response to this Court’s deci\\nsion in Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137 (1995), which\\nheld that the word “use” in the pre-amendment version of\\n§924 “must connote more than mere possession of a fire\\narm by a person who commits a drug offense.” Id., at 143.\\nThe Court in Bailey went on to observe that, “[h]ad Con\\ngress intended possession alone to trigger liability under\\n§924(c)(1), it easily could have so provided” by using the\\nword “possess,” as it had so frequently done in other statu\\ntory provisions. Ibid. Three years later, Congress made\\nthe change and added the word “possesses” to the princi\\n\\x0c14               UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\\n\\n                     Opinion of the Court\\n\\npal paragraph. Congress additionally provided mandatory\\nsentences above the 5-year minimum depending on\\nwhether and how the firearm was used.               Sections\\n924(c)(1)(A)(ii) and (iii) provide sentencing enhancements\\nfor brandishing or discharging the firearm, and the Court\\nhas held that these enhancements are sentencing factors\\nto be found by a judge. See Harris, 536 U. S., at 552−556;\\nsee also Dean v. United States, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\\n(slip op., at 5) (referring to the brandishing and discharge\\nprovisions as “sentencing factors”). The 1998 amendment\\nwas colloquially known as the “Bailey Fix Act.” 144 Cong.\\nRec. 26608 (1998) (remarks of Sen. DeWine); see also\\nDean, supra, at ___ (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (slip op.,\\nat 3).\\n   Aside from shifting the mandatory sentences to manda\\ntory minimums, and this so-called Bailey fix, Congress left\\nthe substance of the statute unchanged. Neither of these\\nsubstantive changes suggests that Congress meant to\\ntransform the machinegun provision from an element into\\na sentencing factor.\\n   The Government stresses a third, structural, difference\\nin the statute, pointing out that the machinegun provision\\nnow resides in a separate subsection, §924(c)(1)(B),\\nwhereas it once resided in the principal paragraph that\\nunmistakably lists offense elements. This structural or\\nstylistic change, though, does not provide a “clear indica\\ntion” that Congress meant to alter its treatment of ma\\nchineguns as an offense element. See Grogan, 498 U. S.,\\nat 290. A more logical explanation for the restructuring is\\nthat it broke up a lengthy principal paragraph, which\\nexceeded 250 words even before adding more to it for the\\nBailey fix, into a more readable statute. This is in step\\nwith current legislative drafting guidelines, which advise\\ndrafters to break lengthy statutory provisions into sepa\\nrate subsections that can be read more easily.

S., at 124−125, Harris, 536\\nU. S., at 552−553, it has rejected the view that this struc\\ntural consideration predominates even when other factors\\npoint in the other direction, id., at 553 (“[E]ven if a statute\\n‘has a look to it suggesting that the numbered subsections\\nare only sentencing provisions,’ ” the Court will not ignore\\n“compelling evidence to the contrary” (quoting Jones, 526\\nU. S., at 232)). For instance, in Jones the Court found that\\nthe federal carjacking statute set forth elements of multi\\nple offenses despite a structure similar to the statute at\\nissue here. Id., at 232−239. And in Harris, the Court was\\ncareful to point out that, unlike the case at bar, the other\\nCastillo factors “reinforce[d] the single-offense interpreta\\ntion implied by the statute’s structure.” 536 U. S., at 553.\\n   In examining the amended version of §924(c)’s struc\\nture, there is an additional consideration that supports\\ninterpreting the machinegun provision to be an offense\\nelement. As explained above, the brandishing and dis\\ncharge provisions codified in §924(A)(ii) and (iii) do state\\nsentencing factors. See Harris, supra, at 552−556; Dean,\\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 5). Had Congress intended to\\ntreat firearm type as a sentencing factor, it likely would\\nhave listed firearm types as clauses (iv) and (v) of sub\\nparagraph (A), instead of as clauses (i) and (ii) of subpara\\ngraph (B). By listing firearm type in stand-alone subpara\\ngraph (B), Congress set it apart from the sentencing\\nfactors in (A)(ii) and (iii); this is consistent with preserving\\nfirearm type as an element of a separate offense.\\n   To be sure, there are some arguments in favor of treat\\ning the machinegun provision as a sentencing factor. The\\n\\x0c16                 UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\\n\\n                       Opinion of the Court\\n\\ncurrent structure of §924(c) is more favorable to that\\ninterpretation than was true in Castillo, particularly\\nbecause the machinegun provision is now positioned be\\ntween the sentencing factors provided in (A)(ii) and (iii),\\nsee Harris, supra, at 552−556, and the recidivist provi\\nsions in (C)(i) and (ii), which are typically sentencing\\nfactors as well. See Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S., at 230.\\nThese points are overcome, however, by the substantial\\nweight of the other Castillo factors and the principle that\\nCongress would not enact so significant a change without\\na clear indication of its purpose to do so. The evident\\ncongressional purpose was to amend the statute to coun\\nteract Bailey and to make the statute more readable but\\nnot otherwise to alter the substance of the statute.

Pennsyl\\nvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986), when we examined the consti\\ntutionality of Pennsylvania’s 1982 Mandatory Minimum\\nSentencing Act (Act).2 The Pennsylvania statute subjected\\nanyone convicted of a specified felony to a mandatory\\nminimum 5-year sentence if the trial judge found, by a\\npreponderance of the evidence, that the defendant “visibly\\npossessed a firearm” during the commission of the offense.\\nSee id., at 81–82. In four prosecutions under the Act, the\\ntrial judges had each held that the statute was unconstitu\\ntional and imposed sentences lower than the 5-year man\\ndatory minimum, presumably because they recognized\\nthat the statute treated the visible possession of a firearm\\nas the functional equivalent of an offense element. Id., at\\n82. On appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court consoli\\ndated the four cases and reversed.3 Id., at 83. It reasoned\\nthat because visible possession of a firearm was a mere\\n“sentencing factor,” rather than an element of any of the\\nspecified offenses defined by the legislature, the protec\\ntions afforded by cases like In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358\\n(1970),4 did not apply.\\n   A bare majority of the McMillan Court endorsed this\\n——————\\n  2 See Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.

Wright, 508 Pa. 25, 494 A. 2d 354 (1985).\\n  4 In Winship, the Court “explicitly” held that “the Due Process Clause\\n\\nprotects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a\\nreasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with\\nwhich he is charged.” 397 U.

Five Justices\\nconcluded that the prerequisite for a mandatory sentence\\nis just a “sentencing factor,” rather than an “element of\\nthe offense,” because the factor does not “alte[r] the maxi\\nmum penalty for the crime” and merely “limit[s] the sen\\ntencing court’s discretion in selecting a penalty within the\\nrange already available to it.” 477 U. S., at 87–88. Yet,\\nalthough the Pennsylvania Act’s 5-year mandatory sen\\ntence for visible possession of a firearm during the com\\nmission of an offense did not exceed the statutory maxi\\nmum that otherwise applied for the crimes of conviction, a\\npositive finding on the so-called sentencing factor man\\ndated the imposition of a sentence that exceeded the pun\\nishment the defendant would have otherwise received.\\nSee id., at 103–104 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).\\n  The majority opinion in McMillan can fairly be de\\nscribed as pathmarking, but unlike one of its predecessors,\\nWinship, it pointed in the wrong direction. For reasons set\\nforth in the opinions joined by the four dissenting Justices\\nin McMillan, I continue to believe that McMillan was\\nincorrectly decided. See id., at 93–94 (Marshall, J., dis\\nsenting); id., at 95–104 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).\\n                            II\\n  Not only was McMillan wrong the day it was decided,\\nbut its reasoning has been substantially undermined—if\\nnot eviscerated—by the development of our Sixth Amend\\nment jurisprudence in more recent years. We now under\\nstand that “ ‘[i]t is unconstitutional [under the Sixth\\nAmendment] for a legislature to remove from the jury the\\nassessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of\\npenalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed.’ ”\\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000) (quoting\\nJones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 252–253 (1999)\\n(STEVENS, J., concurring)). Harmonizing Apprendi with\\nour existing Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, we ex\\n\\x0c4                UNITED STATES v. O’BRIEN\\n\\n                    STEVENS, J., concurring\\n\\nplained that “any fact that increases the penalty for a\\ncrime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be\\nsubmitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable\\ndoubt.” 530 U. S., at 490 (emphasis added). In other\\nwords, we narrowed our holding to those facts that effec\\ntively raised the ceiling on the offense, but did not then\\nconsider whether the logic of our holding applied also\\nto those facts necessary to set the floor of a particular\\nsentence.\\n   As JUSTICE THOMAS eloquently explained in his dissent\\nin Harris v. United States, 536 U. S. 545, 572 (2002), the\\nreasoning in our decision in Apprendi applies with equal\\nforce in the context of mandatory minimums. There is,\\nquite simply, no reason to distinguish between facts that\\ntrigger punishment in excess of the statutory maximum\\nand facts that trigger a mandatory minimum. This case\\nvividly illustrates the point. It is quite plain that there is\\na world of difference between the 81⁄2-year sentence and\\nthe 7-year sentence the judge imposed on the defendants\\nin this case and the 30-year sentence mandated by the\\nmachinegun finding under 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(B).\\n   Mandatory minimums may have a particularly acute\\npractical effect in this type of statutory scheme which\\ncontains an implied statutory maximum of life, see ante,\\nat 10. There is, in this type of case, no ceiling; there is\\nonly a floor below which a sentence cannot fall. Further\\nmore, absent a positive finding on one of §924(c)(1)’s enu\\nmerated factors, it is quite clear that no judge would\\nimpose a sentence as great as the sentences commanded\\nby the provision at issue in this case. Indeed, it appears\\nthat, but for those subject to the 30-year mandatory mini\\nmum, no defendant has ever been sentenced to a sentence\\nanywhere near 30 years for a §924(c) offense.

Harris also involved §924(c)(1), though a\\ndifferent subsection; its reading of the mandatory minimum for “bran\\ndishing” a firearm contained in 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A) as a sentencing\\nfactor is not so easily distinguished from the nearly identical manda\\ntory minimum for possessing a “machinegun” under §924(c)(1)(B).\\n  6 “But in Harris, I said that I thought Apprendi does cover mandatory\\n\\nminimums, but I don’t accept Apprendi. Well, at some point I guess I\\nhave to accept Apprendi, because it’s the law and has been for some\\ntime.

Consequently, facts\\nthat trigger an increased mandatory minimum sentence\\nwarrant constitutional safeguards”).\\n   In my view, it makes no difference whether the sentenc\\ning fact “vaults a defendant’s mandatory minimum sen\\ntence” by many years, ante, at 10, or only “ ‘incremental[ly]\\nchanges’ ” it by a few, ibid.

One question decides the matter: If a sentencing fact\\neither “raises the floor or raises the ceiling” of the range of\\npunishments to which a defendant is exposed, it is, “ ‘by\\ndefinition [an] “elemen[t].” ’ ” Harris, supra, at 579\\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting) (quoting Apprendi, supra, at 483,\\nn. 10).\\n   Without a finding that a defendant used a machinegun,\\nthe penalty range for a conviction under §924(c)(1)(A)(i) is\\nfive years to life imprisonment. But once that finding is\\nadded, the penalty range becomes harsher—30 years to\\nlife imprisonment, §924(c)(1)(B)(ii)—thus “expos[ing] a\\ndefendant to greater punishment than what is otherwise\\nlegally prescribed,” Harris, 536 U.

In light of a provision of that Act requiring the length of official detention in certain circumstances to be limited to \"the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult,\" § 5037(c)(1)(B), the court committed R.L.C. to detention for three years, the maximum sentence for involuntary manslaughter under § 1112(b).  Reading § 5037(c)(1)(B) to bar a juvenile term longer than the sentence a court could impose on a similarly situated adult after applying the United States Sentencing Guidelines, and finding that the Guidelines would yield a maximum sentence of 21 months for an adult in R.L.C.\\'s circumstances, the Court of Appeals vacated his sentence and remanded for resentencing.\\nHeld:  The judgment is affirmed.\\n915 F.2d 320 (CA8 1990), affirmed.\\nJustice SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II-A, and III, concluding:\\n1. Plain-meaning analysis does not compel adoption of the Government\\'s construction that the word \"authorized\" in § 5037(c)(1)(B) must refer to the maximum term of imprisonment provided for by the statute defining the offense.  At least equally consistent, and arguably more natural, is the construction that \"authorized\" refers to the result of applying all statutes with a required bearing on the sentencing decision, including not only those that empower the court to sentence but those that limit the legitimacy of its exercise of that power, including § 3553(b) which requires application of the Guidelines and caps an adult sentence at the top of the relevant Guideline range, absent circumstances warranting departure.  Thus, the most that can be said from examining the text in its present form is that the Government may claim its preferred construction to be one possible resolution of statutory ambiguity.  Pp. 297-298.\\n2. The § 5037(c)(1)(B) limitation refers to the maximum sentence that could be imposed if the juvenile were being sentenced after application of the Guidelines.  Although determining the maximum permissible sentence under § 5037(c)(1)(B) will require sentencing and reviewing courts to determine an appropriate Guideline range in juvenile-delinquency proceedings, it does not require plenary application of the Guidelines to juvenile delinquents.  Where the statutory provision applies, a sentencing court\\'s concern with the Guidelines goes solely to the upper limit of the proper Guideline range as setting the maximum term for which a juvenile may be committed to official detention, absent circumstances that would warrant departure under § 3553(b). Pp. 306-307.\\nJustice SOUTER, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, Justice WHITE, and Justice STEVENS, delivered an opinion with respect to Parts II-B and II-C, concluding that:\\n\\n\\n1\\n1. The textual evolution of § 5037(c)(1)(B) and the relevant legislative history reinforce the conclusion that the section is better understood to refer to the maximum sentence permitted under § 3553(b).  Whereas the predecessor of § 5037(c) spoke in terms of the \"maximum term which could have been imposed on an adult\" (emphasis added), the current version\\'s reference to \"the juvenile,\" on its face suggests a change in reference from abstract considerations to a focused inquiry into the circumstances of the particular juvenile.  Although an intervening version referred to the maximum sentence \"that would be authorized by section 3581(b) if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult\" (emphasis added), the emphasized language was quickly deleted, resulting in the present statutory text.  The legislative history demonstrates that Congress intended the deletion to conform juvenile and adult maximum sentences, in that § 3581(b), which catalogs such sentences for federal offenses by reference to their relative seriousness, could in some circumstances have appeared to authorize a longer sentence for a juvenile than an adult would have received.  Absent promulgation of the Guidelines, the deletion might have left the question of the \"authorized\" maximum to be determined by reference to the penalty provided by the statute creating the offense.  However, Congress\\' purpose today can be achieved only by reading \"authorized\" to refer to the maximum sentence that may be imposed consistently with § 3553(b), which will generally provide a ceiling more favorable to the juvenile than that contained in the offense-defining statute.  It hardly seems likely that Congress adopted the current § 5037(c) without intending the recently enacted Guidelines scheme to be considered for the purpose of conforming juvenile and adult sentences.  Pp. 298-305.\\n\\n\\n2\\n2. No ambiguity about the statute\\'s intended scope survives the foregoing analysis, but, if any did, the construction yielding the shorter sentence would be chosen under the rule of lenity. That rule\\'s application is unnecessary in this case, however, since this Court has \"always reserved lenity for those situations in which a reasonable doubt persists about a statute\\'s intended scope even after resort to \\'the language and structure, legislative history, and motivating policies\\' of the statute.\" Moskal v. United States, 498 U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 461, 465, 112 L.Ed.2d 449 (citation omitted).  Pp. 305-306.\\n\\n\\n3\\nJustice SCALIA, joined by Justice KENNEDY and Justice THOMAS, concluded that it is not consistent with the rule of lenity to construe a textually ambiguous penal statute against a criminal defendant on the basis of legislative history.  Once it is determined that the statutory text is ambiguous, the rule requires that the more lenient interpretation prevail.  In approving reliance on a statute\\'s \"motivating policies,\" Moskal v. United States, 498 U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 461, 465, seems contrary to Hughey v. United States, 495 U.S. 411, 422, 110 S.Ct. 1979, 1985, 109 L.Ed.2d 408.  And insofar as Moskal requires consideration of legislative history at all, it compromises the purposes of the lenity rule:  to assure that criminal statutes provide fair warning of what conduct is rendered illegal, see, e.g., McBoyle v. United States, 283 U.S. 25, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340, 341, 75 L.Ed. 816, and to assure that society, through its representatives, has genuinely called for the punishment to be meted out, see e.g., United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 348, 92 S.Ct. 515, 522, 30 L.Ed.2d 488.  While the Court has considered legislative history in construing criminal statutes before, it appears that only one case, Dixson v. United States, 465 U.S. 482, 104 S.Ct. 1172, 79 L.Ed.2d 458, has relied on legislative history to \"clarify\" an ambiguous statute against a criminal defendant\\'s interest.  Dixson does not discuss the implications of its decision, and both of the cases it cites in supposed support of its holding found the statute at hand not to be facially ambiguous.  Pp. 307-311.\\n\\n\\n4\\nJustice THOMAS agreed with Justice SCALIA that the use of legislative history to construe an otherwise ambiguous penal statute against a criminal defendant is difficult to reconcile with the rule of lenity.  The rule operates, however, only if ambiguity remains even after a court has applied established principles of construction to the statutory text.  See, e.g., Chapman v. United States, 500 U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 1919, ----, 114 L.Ed.2d 524.  Although knowledge of these principles is imputed to the citizenry, there appears scant justification for also requiring knowledge of extra-legal materials such as legislative history.

We hold that this limitation refers to the maximum sentence that could be imposed if the juvenile were being sentenced after application of the United States Sentencing Guidelines.\\n\\n\\n10\\n* Early in the morning of November 5, 1989, after a night of drinking, the then-16-year-old respondent R.L.C. and another juvenile stole a car with which they struck another automobile, fatally injuring one of its passengers, 2-year-old La Tesha Mountain.  R.L.C. is a member of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians, and these events took place on the Red Lake Indian Reservation, which is within Indian country as defined by federal law.  These circumstances provide federal jurisdiction in this case.  See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1151, 1162, 1153.  Upon certifying that a proceeding was authorized in federal court under § 5032 on the ground that no state court had jurisdiction over the offense, the Government charged R.L.C. with an act of juvenile delinquency.\\n\\n\\n11\\nAfter a bench trial, the District Court found R.L.C. to be a juvenile who had driven the car recklessly while intoxicated and without the owner\\'s authorization, causing Mountain\\'s death. R.L.C. was held to have committed an act of juvenile delinquency within the meaning of § 5031, since his acts would have been the crime of involuntary manslaughter in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1112(a) and 1153 if committed by an adult.  The maximum sentence for involuntary manslaughter under 18 U.S.C. § 1112(b) is three years.  At R.L.C.\\'s dispositional hearing, the District Court granted the Government\\'s request to impose the maximum penalty for the respondent\\'s delinquency and accordingly committed him to official detention for three years.\\n\\n\\n12\\nDespite the manslaughter statute\\'s provision for an adult sentence of that length, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, 915 F.2d 320 (1990), vacated R.L.C.\\'s sentence and remanded for resentencing, after concluding that 36 months exceeded the cap imposed by § 5037(c)(1)(B) upon the period of detention to which a juvenile delinquent may be sentenced. Although the statute merely provides that juvenile detention may not extend beyond \"the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult,\"1 the Court of Appeals read this language to bar a juvenile term longer than the sentence a court could have imposed on a similarly situated adult after applying the United States Sentencing Guidelines.  Under the Guidelines, involuntary manslaughter caused by recklessness has a base offense level of 14.  United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, § 2A1.4(a)(2) (Nov.1991).  The court found, and the Government agrees, see Brief for United States 22, n. 5, that because R.L.C. had the lowest possible criminal history level, Category I, the Guidelines would yield a sentencing range of 15-21 months for a similarly situated adult.  The Court of Appeals therefore concluded that the maximum period of detention to which R.L.C. could be sentenced was 21 months.\\n\\n\\n13\\nThe Government sought no stay of mandate from the Court of Appeals, and on remand the District Court imposed detention for 18 months.  Although R.L.C. has now served this time, his failure to complete the 3-year detention originally imposed and the possibility that the remainder of it could be imposed saves the case from mootness.  See United States v. Villamonte-Marquez, 462 U.S. 579, 581, n. 2, 103 S.Ct. 2573, 2575, n. 2, 77 L.Ed.2d 22 (1983).  We granted the Government\\'s petition for certiorari, 501 U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 2850, 115 L.Ed.2d 1018 (1991), to resolve the conflict between the Eighth Circuit\\'s holding in this case and the Ninth Circuit\\'s position, adopted in United States v. Marco L., 868 F.2d 1121, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 956, 110 S.Ct. 369, 107 L.Ed.2d 355 (1989), and endorsed by the Government.\\n\\nII\\nA.\\n\\n14\\nThe Government suggests a straightforward enquiry into plain meaning to explain what is \"authorized.\"  It argues that the word \"authorized\" must mean the maximum term of imprisonment provided for by the statute defining the offense, since only Congress can \"authorize\" a term of imprisonment in punishment for a crime.  As against the position that the Sentencing Guidelines now circumscribe a trial court\\'s authority, the Government insists that our concern must be with the affirmative authority for imposing a sentence, which necessarily stems from statutory law. It maintains that in any event the Sentencing Commission\\'s congressional authorization to establish sentencing guidelines does not create affirmative authority to set punishments for crime, and that the Guidelines do not purport to authorize the punishments to which they relate.\\n\\n\\n15\\nBut this is too easy.  The answer to any suggestion that the statutory character of a specific penalty provision gives it primacy over administrative sentencing guidelines is that the mandate to apply the Guidelines is itself statutory.  See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b).  More significantly, the Government\\'s argument that \"authorization\" refers only to what is affirmatively provided by penal statutes, without reference to the Sentencing Guidelines to be applied under statutory mandate, seems to us to beg the question.  Of course it is true that no penalty would be \"authorized\" without a statute providing specifically for the penal consequences of defined criminal activity.  The question, however, is whether Congress intended the courts to treat the upper limit of such a penalty as \"authorized\" even when proper application of a statutorily mandated guideline in an adult case would bar imposition up to the limit, and an unwarranted upward departure from the proper guideline range would be reversible error. 18 U.S.C. § 3742.  Here it suffices to say that the Government\\'s construction is by no means plain.  The text is at least equally consistent with treating \"authorized\" to refer to the result of applying all statutes with a required bearing on the sentencing decision, including not only those that empower the court to sentence but those that limit the legitimacy of its exercise of that power.  This, indeed, is arguably the more natural construction.\\n\\n\\n16\\nPlain-meaning analysis does not, then, provide the Government with a favorable answer.  The most that can be said from examining the text in its present form is that the Government may claim its preferred construction to be one possible resolution of statutory ambiguity.\\n\\nB\\n\\n17\\nOn the assumption that ambiguity exists, we turn to examine the textual evolution of the limitation in question and the legislative history that may explain or elucidate it.2  The predecessor of § 5037(c) as included in the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 provided that a juvenile adjudged delinquent could be committed to the custody of the Attorney General for a period \"not [to] extend beyond the juvenile\\'s twenty-first birthday or the maximum term which could have been imposed on an adult convicted of the same offense, whichever is sooner.\"  18 U.S.C. § 5037(b) (1982 Ed.) (emphasis added).  In its current form, the statute refers to the \"maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult.\"  18 U.S.C. § 5037(c) (emphasis added).  On its face, the current language suggests a change in reference from abstract consideration of the penalty permitted in punishment of the adult offense, to a focused inquiry into the maximum that would be available in the circumstances of the particular juvenile before the court.  The intervening history supports this reading.\\n\\n\\n18\\nWith the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (chapter II of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, Pub.L. 98-473, § 214(a), 98 Stat. 2013), § 5037 was rewritten.  As § 5037(c)(1)(B), its relevant provision became \"the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized by section 3581(b) if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult.\"  18 U.S.C. §§ 5037(c)(1)(B), (c)(2)(B)(ii) (1982 Ed., Supp. II) (emphasis added).  The emphasized language was quickly deleted, however, by the Criminal Law and Procedure Technical Amendments Act of 1986, Pub.L. 99-646, § 21(a)(2), 100 Stat. 3596 (Technical Amendments Act), resulting in the present statutory text, \"the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult.\"  It thus lost the reference to § 3581(b), which would have guided the sentencing court in identifying the \"authorized\" term of imprisonment.\\n\\n\\n19\\nR.L.C. argues that this loss is highly significant.  Section 3581(b)3 was and still is part of a classification system adopted in 1984 for use in setting the incidents of punishment for federal offenses by reference to letter grades reflecting their relative seriousness.  One provision, for example, sets the maximum period of supervised release for each letter grade.  18 U.S.C. § 3583. Section 3581(b) sets out the maximum term of imprisonment for each letter grade, providing, for instance, that the authorized term of imprisonment for a Class C felony is not more than 12 years, for a Class D not more than 6, and for a Class E not more than 3.\\n\\n\\n20\\nThe deletion of the reference to § 3581(b) with its specific catalog of statutory maximums would seem to go against the Government\\'s position.  Since, for example, a juvenile who had committed what would have been an adult Class E felony would apparently have been subject to three years of detention, because § 3581(b) \"authorized\" up to three years of imprisonment for an adult, the deletion of the reference to § 3581(b) would appear to indicate some congressional intent to broaden the range of enquiry when determining what was authorized.4\\n\\n\\n21\\nThe Government, however, finds a different purpose, disclosed in the section-by-section analysis prepared by the Department of Justice to accompany the bill that became the Technical Amendments Act.  The Department\\'s analysis included this explanation for the proposal to delete the reference to § 3581(b): \"Because of the effect of 18 U.S.C. § 3559(b)(2), deleting the reference to 18 U.S.C. § 3581(b) will tie the maximum sentences for juveniles to the maximum for adults, rather than making juvenile sentences more severe than adult sentences.\"  131 Cong.Rec. 14177 (1985).  Congress had enacted § 3559 to reconcile the new sentencing schedule, providing for the incidents of conviction according to the offense\\'s assigned letter grade, with the pre-existing body of federal criminal statutes, which of course included no assignments of letter grades to the particular offenses they created.  Section 3559(a) provides a formula for assigning the missing letter based on the maximum term of imprisonment set by the statute creating the offense.  Thus, as it stood at the time of the Technical Amendments Act, it read:\\n\\n\\n22\\n\"(a) Classification\\n\\n\\n23\\n\"An offense that is not specifically classified by a      letter grade in the section defining it, is classified—\\n\\n\\n24\\n\"(1) if the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is—\\n\\n\\n25\\n\"(A) life imprisonment, or if the maximum penalty is      death, as a Class A felony;\\n\\n\\n26\\n\"(B) twenty years or more, as a Class B felony;\\n\\n\\n27\\n\"(C) less than twenty years but ten or more years, as a      Class C felony;\\n\\n\\n28\\n\"(D) less than ten years but five or more years, as a      Class D felony;\\n\\n\\n29\\n\"(E) less than five years but more than one year, as a      Class E felony;\\n\\n\\n30\\n\"(F) one year or less but more than six months, as a      Class A misdemeanor;\\n\\n\\n31\\n\"(G) six months or less but more than thirty days, as a      Class B misdemeanor; \"(H) thirty days or less but more than five days, as a      Class C misdemeanor;  or\\n\\n\\n32\\n\"(I) five days or less, or if no imprisonment is      authorized, as an infraction.\\n\\n\\n33\\n\"(b) Effect of classification\\n\\n\\n34\\n\"An offense classified under subsection (a) carries all      the incidents assigned to the applicable letter designation      except that:\\n\\n\\n35\\n\"(1) the maximum fine that may be imposed is the fine      authorized by the statute describing the offense, or by this      chapter, whichever is the greater;  and\\n\\n\\n36\\n\"(2) the maximum term of imprisonment is the term      authorized by the statute describing the offense.\"  18 U.S.C.      § 3559 (1982 Ed., Supp. II).\\n\\n\\n37\\nThe Government explains that limiting the length of a juvenile detention to that authorized for an adult under § 3581(b) could in some circumstances have appeared to authorize a longer sentence than an adult could have received, when the offense involved was assigned no letter grade in its defining statute. Thus an offense created without letter grade and carrying a maximum term of two years would be treated under § 3559(a) as a Class E felony.  Section 3581(b) provides that a Class E felony carried a maximum of three years.  Regardless of that classification, § 3559(b)(2) (1982 Ed., Supp. II) would certainly preclude sentencing any adult offender to more than two years. Tension would arise, however, where a juvenile had committed the act constituting the offense.  Insofar as § 5037(c) capped the juvenile detention by reference to what was authorized for an adult, the maximum would have been two years;  but insofar as it capped it by reference to what was authorized by § 3581(b), the limit might have appeared to be three.  It was to break this tension, according to the Government, that the reference to § 3581(b) was deleted guaranteeing that no juvenile would be given detention longer than the maximum adult sentence authorized by the statute creating the offense.  The amendment also, the Government says, left the law clear in its reference to the statute creating the offense as the measure of an \"authorized\" sentence.  This conclusion is said to be confirmed by a statement in the House Report that the amendment \"delet[es an] incorrect cross-referenc[e],\" H.R.Rep. No. 99-797, p. 21, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1986, p. 6138 (1986), which, the Government argues, \"suggests that no substantive change was intended.\"  Brief for United States 20, n. 4.\\n\\n\\n38\\nWe agree with the Government\\'s argument up to a point.  A sentencing court could certainly have been confused by the reference to § 3581(b).  A sentencing judge considering a juvenile defendant charged with an offense bearing no letter classification, and told to look for \"the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized [according to letter grade] by section 3581(b),\" would have turned first to § 3559(a) to obtain a letter classification.  The court perhaps would have felt obliged to ignore the provision of § 3559(b) that \"the maximum term of imprisonment is the term authorized by the statute describing the offense,\" in favor of a longer term provided for the appropriate letter grade in § 3581(b).  Indeed, the sentencing judge would have been faced with this puzzle in virtually every case, since the system of classifying by letter grades adopted in 1984 was only to be used in future legislation defining federal criminal offenses.  See Brief for United States 16.  No federal offense on the books at the time the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 was adopted carried a letter grade in its defining statute, and Congress has used the device only rarely in the ensuing years.\\n\\n\\n39\\nThus, while it included a reference to § 3581(b), § 5037(c) was ambiguous.  This ambiguity was resolved by an amendment that, absent promulgation of the Guidelines, might have left the question of the \"authorized\" maximum term of imprisonment to be determined only by reference to the penalty provided by the statute creating the offense, whether expressed as a term of years or simply by reference to letter grade.  The legislative history does not prove, however, that Congress intended \"authorized\" to refer solely to the statute defining the offense despite the enactment of a statute requiring application of the Sentencing Guidelines, a provision that will generally provide a ceiling more favorable to the juvenile than that contained in the offense-defining statute.\\n\\n\\n40\\nIndeed, the contrary intent would seem the better inference. The Justice Department analysis of the Technical Amendments Act, upon which the Government relies, went on to say that \"deleting the reference to 18 U.S.C. § 3581(b) will tie the maximum sentences for juveniles to the maximum for adults, rather than making juvenile sentences more severe than adult sentences.\"  131 Cong.Rec. 14177 (1985).  This is an expression of purpose that today can be achieved only by reading \"authorized\" to refer to the maximum period of imprisonment that may be imposed consistently with 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b).  That statute provides that \"[t]he court shall impose a sentence . . . within the range\" established for the category of offense as set forth in the Guidelines, \"unless the court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.\"  18 U.S.C. § 3553(b).\\n\\n\\n41\\nThe point is reinforced by other elements of the legislative history.  The Senate Report accompanying the 1986 Technical Amendments Act states that the amendment \"makes clear that juvenile sentences are to be of equal length as those for adult offenders committing the same crime.\"  S.Rep. No. 99-278, p. 3 (1986).  This, in turn, reflects the statement in the Senate Report accompanying the Sentencing Reform Act, that the changes in juvenile sentencing law were included \"in order to conform it to the changes made in adult sentencing laws.\"  S.Rep. No. 98-225, p. 155 (1983), U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News, 1984, pp. 3182, 3338. The most fundamental of the Sentencing Reform Act\\'s changes was, of course, the creation of the Sentencing Commission, authorized to promulgate the guidelines required for use by sentencing courts.  It hardly seems likely that Congress adopted the current § 5037(c) with a purpose to conform juvenile and adult maximum sentences without intending the recently authorized Guidelines scheme to be considered for that purpose.  The legislative history thus reinforces our initial conclusion that § 5037 is better understood to refer to the maximum sentence permitted under the statute requiring application of the Guidelines.5\\n\\nC\\n\\n42\\nWe do not think any ambiguity survives.  If any did, however, we would choose the construction yielding the shorter sentence by resting on the venerable rule of lenity, see, e.g., United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 347-348, 92 S.Ct. 515, 522-523, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971), rooted in \" \\'the instinctive distaste against men languishing in prison unless the lawmaker has clearly said they should,\\' \" id., at 348, 92 S.Ct., at 523 (quoting H. Friendly, Benchmarks 209 (1967)).  While the rule has been applied not only to resolve issues about the substantive scope of criminal statutes, but to answer questions about the severity of sentencing, see Bifulco v. United States, 447 U.S. 381, 387, 100 S.Ct. 2247, 2252, 65 L.Ed.2d 205 (1980), its application is unnecessary in this case, since \"we have always reserved lenity for those situations in which a reasonable doubt persists about a statute\\'s intended scope even after resort to \\'the language and structure, legislative history, and motivating policies\\' of the statute.\"  Moskal v. United States, 498 U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 461, 465, 112 L.Ed.2d 449 (1990) (citation omitted).6\\n\\nIII\\n\\n43\\nWe hold therefore that application of the language in § 5037(c)(1)(B) permitting detention for a period not to exceed \"the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult\" refers to the maximum length of sentence to which a similarly situated adult would be subject if convicted of the adult counterpart of the offense and sentenced under the statute requiring application of the Guidelines, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b).  Although determining the maximum permissible sentence under § 5037(c)(1)(B) will therefore require sentencing and reviewing courts to determine an appropriate guideline range in juvenile-delinquency proceedings, we emphasize that it does not require plenary application of the Guidelines to juvenile delinquents.7  Where that statutory provision applies, a sentencing court\\'s concern with the Guidelines goes solely to the upper limit of the proper guideline range as setting the maximum term for which a juvenile may be committed to official detention, absent circumstances that would warrant departure under § 3553(b).\\n\\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is\\n\\n44\\n\\nAffirmed.\\n\\n\\n\\n45\\nJustice SCALIA, with whom Justice KENNEDY and Justice THOMAS join, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.\\n\\n\\n46\\nIn my view it is not consistent with the rule of lenity to construe a textually ambiguous penal statute against a criminal defendant on the basis of legislative history.  Because Justice SOUTER\\'s opinion assumes the contrary, I join only Parts I, II-A, and III, and concur in the judgment.\\n\\n\\n47\\nThe Court begins its analysis, quite properly, by examining the language of 18 U.S.C. § 5037(c)(1)(B)—which proves to be ambiguous.  Reasonable doubt remains, the Court concludes, as to whether the provision refers (i) to the maximum punishment that could be imposed if the juvenile were being sentenced under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (15-21 months) or (ii) to the maximum punishment authorized by the statute defining the offense, see 18 U.S.C. § 1112(a) (36 months).  Ante, at 298.  With that conclusion I agree—and that conclusion should end the matter.  The rule of lenity, in my view, prescribes the result when a criminal statute is ambiguous:  the more lenient interpretation must prevail.\\n\\n\\n48\\nYet the plurality continues.  Armed with its warrant of textual ambiguity, the plurality conducts a search of § 5037\\'s legislative history to determine whether that clarifies the statute.  Happily for this defendant, the plurality\\'s extratextual inquiry is benign:  It uncovers evidence that the \"better understood\" reading of § 5037 is the more lenient one.  Ante, at 305.  But this methodology contemplates as well a different ending, one in which something said in a Committee Report causes the criminal law to be stricter than the text of the law displays. According to the plurality, \"we resort to the [rule of lenity] only when \\'a reasonable doubt persists about a statute\\'s intended scope even after resort to \"the language and structure, legislative history, and motivating policies\" of the statute.\\' \" Ante, at 305-306 (quoting Moskal v. United States, 498 U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 461, 465, 112 L.Ed.2d 449 (1990) (citation omitted).  I doubt that Moskal accurately characterizes the law in this area, and I am certain that its treatment of \"the venerable rule of lenity,\" ante, at 305, does not venerate the important values the old rule serves.\\n\\n\\n49\\nThe Moskal formulation of the rule, in approving reliance on a statute\\'s \"motivating policies\" (an obscure phrase), seems contrary to our statement in Hughey v. United States, 495 U.S. 411, 422, 110 S.Ct. 1979, 1985, 109 L.Ed.2d 408 (1990), that \"[e]ven [where] the statutory language . . . [is] ambiguous, longstanding principles of lenity . . . preclude our resolution of the ambiguity against [the criminal defendant] on the basis of general declarations of policy in the statute and legislative history.\"  And insofar as Moskal requires consideration of legislative history at all, it compromises what we have described to be purposes of the lenity rule.  \"[A] fair warning,\" we have said, \"should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.  To make the warning fair, so far as possible the line should be clear.\"  McBoyle v. United States, 283 U.S. 25, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340, 341, 75 L.Ed. 816 (1931).  \"[T]he rule of lenity ensures that criminal statutes will provide fair warning concerning conduct rendered illegal.\"  Liparota v. United States, 471 U.S. 419, 427, 105 S.Ct. 2084, 2089, 85 L.Ed.2d 434 (1985). It may well be true that in most cases the proposition that the words of the United States Code or the Statutes at Large give adequate notice to the citizen is something of a fiction, see McBoyle, supra, 283 U.S., at 27, 51 S.Ct., at 341, albeit one required in any system of law;  but necessary fiction descends to needless farce when the public is charged even with knowledge of Committee Reports.\\n\\n\\n50\\nMoskal\\'s mode of analysis also disserves the rule of lenity\\'s other purpose:  assuring that the society, through its representatives, has genuinely called for the punishment to be meted out.  \"[B]ecause of the seriousness of criminal penalties, and because criminal punishment usually represents the moral condemnation of the community, legislatures and not courts should define criminal activity.\"  United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 348, 92 S.Ct. 515, 523, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971).  See also Liparota, supra, 471 U.S., at 427, 105 S.Ct., at 2089;  United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95, 5 L.Ed. 37 (1820).  The rule reflects, as the plurality acknowledges, \" \\' \"the instinctive distaste against men languishing in prison unless the lawmaker has clearly said they should.\" \\' \"  Ante, at 305 (quoting Bass, supra, 404 U.S., at 348, 92 S.Ct., at 523, and H. Friendly, Benchmarks 209 (1967)).  But legislative history can never provide assurance against that unacceptable result.  After all, \"[a] statute is a statute,\" ante, at 305, n. 5, and no matter how \"authoritative\" the history may be—even if it is that veritable Rosetta Stone of legislative archaeology, a crystal clear Committee Report—one can never be sure that the legislators who voted for the text of the bill were aware of it.  The only thing that was authoritatively adopted for sure was the text of the enactment;  the rest is necessarily speculation.  Where it is doubtful whether the text includes the penalty, the penalty ought not be imposed.  \"[T]he moral condemnation of the community,\" Bass, supra, at 348, 92 S.Ct., at 523, is no more reflected in the views of a majority of a single committee of congressmen (assuming, of course, they have genuinely considered what their staff has produced) than it is reflected in the views of a majority of an appellate court;  we should feel no less concerned about \"men languishing in prison\" at the direction of the one than of the other.\\n\\n\\n51\\nWe have in a number of cases other than Moskal done what the plurality has done here:  inquired into legislative history and invoked it to support or at least permit the more lenient reading. But only once, to my knowledge, have we relied on legislative history to \"clarify\" a statute, explicitly found to be facially ambiguous, against the interest of a criminal defendant.  In Dixson v. United States, 465 U.S. 482, 500-501, n. 19, 104 S.Ct. 1172, 1181-1182, n. 19, 79 L.Ed.2d 458 (1984), the Court relied on legislative history to determine that defendants, officers of a corporation responsible for administering federal block grants, were \"public officials\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 201(a). The opinion does not trouble to discuss the \"fair warning\" or \"condemnation of the community\" implications of its decision, and both of the cases it cites in supposed support of its holding found the statute at hand not to be facially ambiguous.  See United States v. Moore, 423 U.S. 122, 131, 96 S.Ct. 335, 340, 46 L.Ed.2d 333 (1975) (\"By its terms § 841 reaches \\'any person\\' \" and \"does not exempt (as it could have) \\'all registrants\\' or \\'all persons registered under this Act\\' \");  United States v. Brown, 333 U.S. 18, 22, 68 S.Ct. 376, 378, 92 L.Ed. 442 (1948) (\"The legislation reflects an unmistakable intention to provide punishment for escape or attempted escape to be superimposed upon the punishment meted out for previous offenses.  This appears from the face of the statute itself.\").  I think Dixson weak (indeed, utterly unreasoned) foundation for a rule of construction that permits legislative history to satisfy the ancient requirement that criminal statutes speak \"plainly and unmistakably,\" United States v. Gradwell, 243 U.S. 476, 485, 37 S.Ct. 407, 411, 61 L.Ed. 857 (1917);  see also Bass, supra, 404 U.S., at 348, 92 S.Ct., at 522.\\n\\n\\n52\\nIn sum, I would not embrace, as the plurality does, the Moskal formulation of this canon of construction, lest lower courts take the dictum to heart.  I would acknowledge the tension in our precedents, the absence of an examination of the consequences of the Moskal mode of analysis, and the consequent conclusion that Moskal may not be good law.\\n\\n\\n53\\nJustice THOMAS, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.\\n\\n\\n54\\nI agree with Justice SCALIA that the use of legislative history to construe an otherwise ambiguous penal statute against a criminal defendant is difficult to reconcile with the rule of lenity.  I write separately, however, to emphasize that the rule is not triggered merely because a statute appears textually ambiguous on its face.  Just last Term, we reaffirmed that the rule operates only \" \\'at the end of the process\\' \" of construction, Chapman v. United States, 500 U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 1926, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991) (quoting Callanan v. United States, 364 U.S. 587, 596, 81 S.Ct. 321, 326, 5 L.Ed.2d 312 (1961)), if ambiguity remains \"even after a court has \\' \"seize[d] every thing from which aid can be derived,\" \\' \" ibid. (quoting United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 347, 92 S.Ct. 515, 522, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971), in turn quoting United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch 358, 386, 2 L.Ed. 304 (1805)).  Thus, although we require Congress to enact \"clear and definite\" penal statutes, United States v. Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp., 344 U.S. 218, 221-222, 73 S.Ct. 227, 229-230, 97 L.Ed. 260 (1952), we also consult our own \"well-established principles of statutory construction,\" Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 840, 849, 112 L.Ed.2d 919 (1991), in determining whether the relevant text is clear and definite.  See, e.g., id., at ----, 111 S.Ct., at 846 (applying the rule in Arnold v. United States, 9 Cranch 104, 119-120, 3 L.Ed. 671 (1815), that statutes become effective immediately);  Albernaz v. United States, 450 U.S. 333, 337-342, 101 S.Ct. 1137, 1141-1144, 67 L.Ed.2d 275 (1981) (applying the rule in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), to establish the permissibility of multiple punishments).\\n\\n\\n55\\nThese cases, I think, demonstrate that we must presume familiarity not only with the United States Code, see ante, at 309, but also with the United States Reports, in which we have developed innumerable rules of construction powerful enough to make clear an otherwise ambiguous penal statute.  Cf. Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843, n. 9, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781, n. 9, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984) (\"clear congressional intent\" may be discerned by application of \"traditional tools of statutory construction\"). Like Congress\\'s statutes, the decisions of this Court are law, the knowledge of which we have always imputed to the citizenry.  At issue here, though, is a rule that would also require knowledge of committee reports and floor statements, which are not law.  I agree with Justice SCALIA that there appears scant justification for extending the \"necessary fiction\" that citizens know the law, see ante, at 309, to such extra-legal materials.\\n\\n\\n56\\nJustice O\\'CONNOR, with whom Justice BLACKMUN joins, dissenting.\\n\\n\\n57\\nBy failing to interpret 18 U.S.C. § 5037(c)(1)(B) in light of the statutory scheme of which it is a part, the Court interprets a \"technical amendment\" to make sweeping changes to the process and focus of juvenile sentencing.  Instead, the Court should honor Congress\\' clear intention to leave settled practice in juvenile sentencing undisturbed.\\n\\n\\n58\\nWhen Congress enacted the Sentencing Reform Act in 1984, it authorized the United States Sentencing Commission (Sentencing Commission or Commission) to overhaul the discretionary system of adult sentencing.  As an important aspect of this overhaul, Guidelines sentencing formalizes sentencing procedures.  The Commission explains:\\n\\n\\n59\\n\"In pre-guidelines practice, factors relevant to sentencing      were often determined in an informal fashion.  The      informality was to some extent explained by the fact that      particular offense and offender characteristics rarely had a      highly specific or required sentencing consequence.  This      situation will no longer exist under sentencing guidelines.      The court\\'s resolution of disputed sentencing factors will      usually have a measurable effect on the applicable      punishment.  More formality is therefore unavoidable if the sentencing process is to be accurate and fair.\"  United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, (Nov.1991) § 6A1.3, comment.\\n\\n\\n60\\nAnother significant change permits an appeal when the Guidelines are incorrectly applied or departed from, 18 U.S.C. § 3742;  under prior law, a sentence within statutory limits was not generally subject to review.  United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443, 447, 92 S.Ct. 589, 591, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972).  Thus, factual findings made at adult sentencing hearings can be challenged on appeal.\\n\\n\\n61\\nWhen Congress made these fundamental changes in sentencing, it repealed the Youth Corrections Act, Pub.L. 98-473, Title II, § 218(a)(8), 98 Stat. 2027 (1984), which gave special treatment to defendants under 22.  Congress did not, however, repeal the Juvenile Delinquency Act, which applies to defendants under 18, and clearly indicated that the Commission was only to study the feasibility of sentencing guidelines for juveniles, see 28 U.S.C. § 995(a)(1)-(a)(9), a process which is still in progress.  Brief for United States 11, n. 1.  Thus, Congress did not intend the Guidelines to apply to juveniles.  Section 5037(c)(1)(B) must be interpreted against this backdrop.\\n\\n\\n62\\nBefore the Sentencing Reform Act, § 5037(c)(1)(B) limited juvenile sentences by the correlative adult statutory maximum.  As part of the Sentencing Reform Act, Congress made clear that this past practice would remain the same by limiting juvenile sentences to:  \"the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized by section 3581(b) if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult,\" 18 U.S.C. § 5037(c)(1)(B) (1982 Ed., Supp. II) (emphasis added).  The reference to § 3581(b), which classifies offenses and sets out maximum terms, clarified that the statutory maximum of the offense, not the Guideline maximum, would still limit the juvenile\\'s sentence.  Thus, consonant with its decision to leave juvenile sentencing in place, Congress did not change § 5037(c)(1)(B) to require sentencing judges in juvenile cases to calculate Guideline maximum sentences.\\n\\n\\n63\\nAs the Court acknowledges, ante, at 299-304, the cross-reference to § 3581(b) added by the Sentencing Reform Act created a new ambiguity as to whether the maximum sentence referred to was that authorized in the particular offense statute, or in the offense classification statute.  To resolve the ambiguity, the cross-reference was deleted in 1986 as one of numerous technical amendments.  The Court reads this technical amendment as changing § 3581\\'s reference from the statutory maximum to the Guideline maximum, even though before the amendment the statute clearly did not refer to the Guideline maximum.  While the original version of § 5037(c)(1)(B) was ambiguous in other respects, there was never any question that § 5037(c)(1)(B) referred to the adult statutory maximum.  There is no indication that Congress intended to change pre-existing practice.  Section 5037(c)(1)(B), read in this context, still unambiguously refers to the statutory maximum.  And because § 5037(c)(1)(B) is unambiguous in this respect, the rule of lenity does not apply here.  Moskal v. United States, 498 U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 461, ----, 112 L.Ed.2d 449 (1990) (Court may look to structure of statute to ascertain the sense of a provision before resorting to rule of lenity).  The Court, however, construes § 5037(c)(1)(B) to change pre-existing practice only by reading it in a vacuum apart from the rest of the Sentencing Reform Act, thus violating the canon of construction that \"the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\"  Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 809, 109 S.Ct. 1500, 1504, 103 L.Ed.2d 891 (1989).\\n\\n\\n64\\nThe practical implications of the Court\\'s reading demonstrate why its construction runs contrary to Congress\\' decision not to apply the Guidelines to juveniles.  Requiring a district court to calculate a Guideline maximum for each juvenile imports formal factfinding procedures foreign to the discretionary sentencing system Congress intended to retain.  Juvenile proceedings, in contrast to adult proceedings, have traditionally aspired to be \"intimate, informal [and] protective.\"  McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, 403 U.S. 528, 545, 91 S.Ct. 1976, 1986, 29 L.Ed.2d 647 (1971).  One reason for the traditional informality of juvenile proceedings is that the focus of sentencing is on treatment, not punishment.  The presumption is that juveniles are still teachable and not yet \"hardened criminals.\"  S.Rep. No. 1989, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., 1 (1938).  See McKeiver, supra;  18 U.S.C. § 5039 (\"Whenever possible, the Attorney General shall commit a juvenile to a foster home or community-based facility located in or near his home community\"). As a result, the sentencing considerations relevant to juveniles are far different from those relevant to adults.\\n\\n\\n65\\nThe Court asserts, naively it seems to me, that it is not requiring \"plenary application\" of the Guidelines, ante, at 307, and makes the process of determining the Guideline maximum seem easy—a court need only look at the offense the juvenile was found guilty of violating and his criminal history.   Ante, at 296. In practice, however, calculating a Guideline maximum is much more complicated.  Even in this relatively straightforward case, respondent was said to have stolen the car he was driving. Although apparently not placed in issue at the sentencing hearing, that conduct might, if proven and connected to the offense of which respondent was convicted, enhance the applicable Guideline maximum as \"relevant conduct.\"  See USSG § 1B1.3.  Respondent\\'s role in the offense might also warrant an adjustment of the Guideline maximum.  §§ 3B1.1, 3B1.2.  The District Court made a determination that respondent had not accepted responsibility, and that finding changed the calculation of the Guideline maximum. Tr. 3 (Jan. 25, 1991), § 3E1.1.  The District Court also had to take into account factors not considered by the Guidelines in determining whether or not a departure was warranted, which would increase or decrease the \"maximum\" sentence by an undiscernible \"reasonable\" amount.  Tr. 3-4, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b).  In short, the Guideline maximum is not static or readily ascertainable, but depends on particularized findings of fact and discretionary determinations made by the sentencing judge.\\n\\n\\n66\\nThese determinations may even require adversarial evidentiary hearings.  Yet such formal factual investigations are not provided for by the Juvenile Delinquency Act.  There is no indication in the statute that the judge is required to support the sentence with particular findings.  USSG § 6A1.3 and Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(a)(1), as amended after the Guidelines, do provide for an adversarial sentencing procedure for adults that accommodates Guideline factfinding.  Rule 32 does not apply when it conflicts with provisions of the Juvenile Delinquency Act, however, see Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 54(b)(5), and it seems to me a serious question whether adversarial factfinding is what Congress had in mind for juvenile sentencing.  An even more serious question is whether Congress intended juveniles to be able to appeal the findings of fact that determine the Guideline maximum. Yet the Court\\'s decision would seem to require provision for such appeals.\\n\\n\\n67\\nIn addition, a Guideline maximum for an adult incorporates factors the Sentencing Commission has found irrelevant to juvenile sentencing, see, e.g., USSG § 4B1.1 (career offender status inapplicable to defendants under 18), and does not incorporate factors Congress has found relevant to juvenile sentencing, see, e.g., USSG §§ 5H1.1, 5H1.6 (age and family ties irrelevant to Guideline sentencing).  As a result, the Guideline maximum for an adult cannot serve as a useful point of comparison.  In sum, the cumbersome process of determining a comparable Guideline maximum threatens to dominate the juvenile sentencing hearing at the expense of considerations more relevant to juveniles.\\n\\n\\n68\\nI cannot infer that Congress meant to overhaul and refocus the procedures of juvenile sentencing in such a fundamental way merely by deleting a cross-reference in a technical amendment, especially when Congress expressly left juvenile sentencing out of the scope of the Sentencing Reform Act and directed the Commission to examine how sentencing guidelines might be tailored to juveniles.\\n\\n\\n69\\nThis case is admittedly unusual in that respondent was sentenced to a longer sentence than a similarly situated adult. Before the Guidelines were enacted, however, such anomalies were not unknown:  A juvenile could receive a longer sentence than a similarly situated adult, as long as the sentence was within the statutory maximum.  We should not try to address the disparity presented in this particular case by changing all juvenile sentencing in ways that Congress did not intend.  Instead, we should wait for the Sentencing Commission and Congress to decide whether to fashion appropriate guidelines for juveniles.  For this reason, I respectfully dissent.\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n 18 U.S.C. § 5037(c) provides:\\n\"(c) The term for which official detention may be ordered for a juvenile found to be a juvenile delinquent may not extend—\\n\"(1) in the case of a juvenile who is less than eighteen years old, beyond the lesser of—\\n\"(A) the date when the juvenile becomes twenty-one years old; or\\n\"(B) the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult;  or\\n\"(2) in the case of a juvenile who is between eighteen and twenty-one years old—\\n\"(A) who if convicted as an adult would be convicted of a Class A, B, or C felony, beyond five years;  or\\n\"(B) in any other case beyond the lesser of—\\n\"(i) three years;  or\\n\"(ii) the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult.\"\\n\\n\\n2\\n R.L.C. argues that the broader statutory purpose supports his position.  He contends that longer juvenile sentences are only justified by a rehabilitative purpose.  See, e.g., Carter v. United States, 113 U.S.App.D.C. 123, 125, 306 F.2d 283, 285 (1962) (imposing a longer juvenile sentence under the now-repealed Youth Corrections Act) (\"[R]ehabilitation may be regarded as comprising the quid pro quo for a longer confinement but under different conditions and terms than a defendant would undergo in an ordinary prison\").  He then suggests that the Sentencing Reform Act rejected the rehabilitative model not merely for adult imprisonment, see Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 366-367, 109 S.Ct. 647, 651-652, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989), but for juveniles as well.  See Brief for Respondent 19.  While it is true that some rehabilitative tools were removed from the juvenile penalty scheme in 1984, see Pub.L. 98-473, § 214(b), 98 Stat. 2014 (abolishing parole for juvenile delinquents), the Juvenile Delinquency Act does not completely reject rehabilitative objectives.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 5035, 5039.  We do not think a broader congressional purpose points clearly in either party\\'s direction.\\n\\n\\n3\\n \"(b) Authorized terms.—The authorized terms of imprisonment are—\\n\"(1) for a Class A felony, the duration of the defendant\\'s life or any period of time;\\n\"(2) for a Class B felony, not more than twenty-five years;\\n\"(3) for a Class C felony, not more than twelve years;\\n\"(4) for a Class D felony, not more than six years;\\n\"(5) for a Class E felony, not more than three years;\\n\"(6) for a Class A misdemeanor, not more than one year;\\n\"(7) for a Class B misdemeanor, not more than six months;\\n\"(8) for a Class C misdemeanor, not more than thirty days; and\\n\"(9) for an infraction, not more than five days.\"  18 U.S.C. § 3581.\\n\\n\\n4\\n We speak here of an indication appearing solely from the face of the text.  In fact, so far as we can tell, at the time of the amendment no federal statute defining an offense referred to it by letter grade.\\n\\n\\n5\\n The dissent takes us to task for reliance upon a \"technical amendment.\"  But a statute is a statute, whatever its label.  Although the critical congressional enactment, the deletion of the reference to § 3581(b), came in the Criminal Law and Procedures Technical Amendments Act, we have applied the usual tools of statutory construction:  the language left in the statute after its amendment in 1986 is most naturally read to refer to the term of imprisonment authorized after application of the statute mandating use of the Guidelines.  The legislative history of the Technical Amendments Act reinforces this conclusion.\\n\\n\\n6\\n Justice SCALIA questions the soundness of Moskal \\'s statement that we have reserved lenity for those cases (unlike this one) in which after examining \"the . . . structure, legislative history, and motivating policies\" in addition to the text of an ambiguous criminal statute, we are still left with a reasonable doubt about the intended scope of the statute\\'s application.  But the Court has not in the past approached the use of lenity in the way Justice SCALIA would have it.\\nIt is true that the need for fair warning will make it \"rare that legislative history or statutory policies will support a construction of a statute broader than that clearly warranted by the text,\" Crandon v. United States, 494 U.S. 152, 160, 110 S.Ct. 997, 1002-03, 108 L.Ed.2d 132 (1990), and that \"general declarations of policy,\" whether in the text or the legislative history, will not support construction of an ambiguous criminal statute against the defendant.  Hughey v. United States, 495 U.S. 411, 422, 110 S.Ct. 1979, 1985, 109 L.Ed.2d 408 (1990).  But lenity does not always require the \"narrowest\" construction, and our cases have recognized that a broader construction may be permissible on the basis of nontextual factors that make clear the legislative intent where it is within the fair meaning of the statutory language.  See Dixson v. United States, 465 U.S. 482, 500-501, n. 19, 104 S.Ct. 1172, 1181-1182, n. 19, 79 L.Ed.2d 458 (1984).  Cf. McBoyle v. United States, 283 U.S. 25, 27, 51 S.Ct. 340, 341, 75 L.Ed. 816 (1931) (a criminal statute should be construed in such a way that its language gives \"fair warning\" to the \"common mind\").  Whether lenity should be given the more immediate and dispositive role Justice SCALIA espouses is an issue that is not raised and need not be reached in this case.\\n\\n\\n7\\n The Sentencing Guidelines, of course, do not directly apply to juvenile delinquency proceedings.  We observe that 28 U.S.C. § 995(a)(19), also enacted as part of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, gives the Sentencing Commission power to \"study the feasibility of developing guidelines for the disposition of juvenile delinquents.\"  The Government reports that the Sentencing Commission has recently begun such study.

SANTOS ET AL.\\n\\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\\n\\n      No. 06–1005. Argued October 3, 2007—Decided June 2, 2008\\nIn an illegal lottery run by respondent Santos, runners took commis-\\n  sions from the bets they gathered, and some of the rest of the money\\n  was paid as salary to respondent Diaz and other collectors and to the\\n  winning gamblers. Based on these payments to runners, collectors,\\n  and winners, Santos was convicted of, inter alia, violating the federal\\n  money-laundering statute, 18 U. S. C. §1956, which prohibits the use\\n  of the “proceeds” of criminal activities for various purposes, including\\n  engaging in, and conspiring to engage in, transactions intended to\\n  promote the carrying on of unlawful activity, §1956(a)(1)(A)(i) and\\n  §1956(h). Based on his receipt of salary, Diaz pleaded guilty to con-\\n  spiracy to launder money. The Seventh Circuit affirmed the convic-\\n  tions. On collateral review, the District Court ruled that, under in-\\n  tervening Circuit precedent interpreting the word “proceeds” in the\\n  federal money-laundering statute, §1956(a)(1)(A)(i) applies only to\\n  transactions involving criminal profits, not criminal receipts. Find-\\n  ing no evidence that the transactions on which respondents’ money-\\n  laundering convictions were based involved lottery profits, the court\\n  vacated those convictions. The Seventh Circuit affirmed.\\nHeld: The judgment is affirmed.\\n461 F. 3d 886, affirmed.\\n    JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by JUSTICE SOUTER, JUSTICE THOMAS, and\\n  JUSTICE GINSBURG, concluded in Parts I–III and V that the term “pro-\\n  ceeds” in §1956(a)(1) means “profits,” not “receipts.” Pp. 3–14, 16–17.\\n    (a) The rule of lenity dictates adoption of the “profits” reading. The\\n  statute nowhere defines “proceeds.” An undefined term is generally\\n  given its ordinary meaning. Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S.\\n  179, 187. However, dictionaries and the Federal Criminal Code\\n\\x0c2                     UNITED STATES v. SANTOS\\n\\n                                  Syllabus\\n\\n    sometimes define “proceeds” to mean “receipts” and sometimes “prof-\\n    its.” Moreover, the many provisions in the federal money-laundering\\n    statute that use the word “proceeds” make sense under either defini-\\n    tion. The rule of lenity therefore requires the statute to be inter-\\n    preted in favor of defendants, and the “profits” definition of “pro-\\n    ceeds” is always more defendant-friendly than the “receipts”\\n    definition. Pp. 3–6.\\n       (b) The Government’s contention that the “profits” interpretation\\n    fails to give the money-laundering statute its intended scope begs the\\n    question; the Government’s contention that the “profits” interpreta-\\n    tion hinders effective enforcement of the law is exaggerated. Neither\\n    suffices to overcome the rule of lenity. Pp. 6–14.\\n       (c) None of the transactions on which respondents’ money-\\n    laundering convictions were based can fairly be characterized as in-\\n    volving the lottery’s profits. Pp. 16–17.\\n       JUSTICE SCALIA, joined by JUSTICE SOUTER and JUSTICE GINSBURG,\\n    concluded in Part IV that JUSTICE STEVENS’ position that “proceeds”\\n    should be interpreted to mean profits for some predicate crimes, “re-\\n    ceipts” for others, is contrary to this Court’s precedents holding that\\n    judges cannot give the same statutory text different meanings in dif-\\n    ferent cases, see Clark v. Martinez, 543 U. S. 371. Pp. 14–16.\\n       JUSTICE STEVENS concluded that revenue a gambling business uses\\n    to pay essential operating expenses is not “proceeds” under 18\\n    U. S. C. §1956. When, as here, Congress fails to define potentially\\n    ambiguous statutory terms, it effectively delegates the task to federal\\n    judges. See Commissioner v. Fink, 483 U. S. 89, 104. Because Con-\\n    gress could have required that “proceeds” have one meaning when re-\\n    ferring to some of the specified unlawful activities listed in\\n    §1956(c)(7) and a different meaning when referring to others, judges\\n    filling statutory gaps may also do so, as long as they are conscien-\\n    tiously endeavoring to carry out Congress’ intent. Section 1956’s leg-\\n    islative history makes clear that “proceeds” includes gross revenues\\n    from the sale of contraband and the operation of organized crime\\n    syndicates involving such sales, but sheds no light on how to identify\\n    the proceeds of an unlicensed stand-alone gambling venture. Fur-\\n    thermore, the consequences of applying a “gross receipts” definition of\\n    “proceeds” to respondents are so perverse that Congress could not\\n    have contemplated them: Allowing the Government to treat the mere\\n    payment of an illegal gambling business’ operating expenses as a\\n    separate offense is in practical effect tantamount to double jeopardy,\\n    which is particularly unfair in this case because the penalties for\\n    money laundering are substantially more severe than those for the\\n    underlying offense of operating a gambling business. Accordingly,\\n    the rule of lenity may weigh in the determination, and in that respect\\n\\x0c                     Cite as: 553 U.

S. C. §1956(a)(1), means\\n“receipts” or “profits.”\\n                               I\\n   From the 1970’s until 1994, respondent Santos operated a\\nlottery in Indiana that was illegal under state law. See Ind.\\nCode §35–45–5–3 (West 2004). Santos employed a number\\nof helpers to run the lottery. At bars and restaurants,\\nSantos’s runners gathered bets from gamblers, kept a por-\\ntion of the bets (between 15% and 25%) as their commis-\\nsions, and delivered the rest to Santos’s collectors. Collec-\\ntors, one of whom was respondent Diaz, then delivered the\\nmoney to Santos, who used some of it to pay the salaries of\\ncollectors (including Diaz) and to pay the winners.\\n   These payments to runners, collectors, and winners\\nformed the basis of a 10-count indictment filed in the\\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of\\n\\x0c2               UNITED STATES v. SANTOS\\n\\n                    Opinion of SCALIA, J.\\n\\nIndiana, naming Santos, Diaz, and 11 others. A jury\\nfound Santos guilty of one count of conspiracy to run an\\nillegal gambling business (§371), one count of running an\\nillegal gambling business (§1955), one count of conspiracy\\nto launder money (§1956(a)(1)(A)(i) and §1956(h)), and two\\ncounts of money laundering (§1956(a)(1)(A)(i)). The court\\nsentenced Santos to 60 months of imprisonment on the\\ntwo gambling counts and to 210 months of imprisonment\\non the three money-laundering counts. Diaz pleaded\\nguilty to conspiracy to launder money, and the District\\nCourt sentenced him to 108 months of imprisonment. The\\nCourt of Appeals affirmed the convictions and sentences.\\nUnited States v. Febus, 218 F. 3d 784 (CA7 2000). We\\ndeclined to review the case. 531 U. S. 1021 (2000).\\n   Thereafter, respondents filed motions under 28 U. S. C.\\n§2255, collaterally attacking their convictions and sen-\\ntences. The District Court rejected all of their claims but\\none, a challenge to their money-laundering convictions\\nbased on the Seventh Circuit’s subsequent decision in\\nUnited States v. Scialabba, 282 F. 3d 475 (2002), which\\nheld that the federal money-laundering statute’s prohibi-\\ntion of transactions involving criminal “proceeds” applies\\nonly to transactions involving criminal profits, not crimi-\\nnal receipts. Id., at 478. Applying that holding to respon-\\ndents’ cases, the District Court found no evidence that the\\ntransactions on which the money-laundering convictions\\nwere based (Santos’s payments to runners, winners, and\\ncollectors and Diaz’s receipt of payment for his collection\\nservices) involved profits, as opposed to receipts, of the\\nillegal lottery, and accordingly vacated the money-\\nlaundering convictions. The Court of Appeals affirmed,\\nrejecting the Government’s contention that Scialabba was\\nwrong and should be overruled. 461 F. 3d 886 (CA7 2006).\\nWe granted certiorari. 550 U.

S. C. §1956(a)(1)(A)(i), which\\ncriminalizes transactions to promote criminal activity.1\\nThis provision uses the term “proceeds” in describing two\\nelements of the offense: the Government must prove that a\\ncharged transaction “in fact involve[d] the proceeds of\\nspecified unlawful activity” (the proceeds element), and it\\nalso must prove that a defendant knew “that the property\\ninvolved in” the charged transaction “represent[ed] the\\nproceeds of some form of unlawful activity” (the knowledge\\nelement). §1956(a)(1).\\n  The federal money-laundering statute does not define\\n“proceeds.” When a term is undefined, we give it its ordi-\\nnary meaning. Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer, 513 U. S.\\n179, 187 (1995). “Proceeds” can mean either “receipts” or\\n“profits.” Both meanings are accepted, and have long been\\naccepted, in ordinary usage. See, e.g., 12 Oxford English\\nDictionary 544 (2d ed. 1989); Random House Dictionary of\\nthe English Language 1542 (2d ed. 1987); Webster’s New\\nInternational Dictionary 1972 (2d ed. 1957) (hereinafter\\nWebster’s 2d). The Government contends that dictionaries\\ngenerally prefer the “receipts” definition over the “profits”\\n——————\\n   1 Section 1956(a)(1) reads as follows: “Whoever, knowing that the\\n\\nproperty involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of\\nsome form of unlawful activity, conducts or attempts to conduct such a\\nfinancial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified\\nunlawful activity . . . (A)(i) with the intent to promote the carrying on of\\nspecified unlawful activity . . . shall be sentenced to a fine of not more\\nthan $500,000 or twice the value of the property involved in the trans-\\naction, whichever is greater, or imprisonment for not more than twenty\\nyears, or both.”\\n   Respondents were also convicted of conspiring to launder money\\nunder §1956(h). Because the Government has not argued that respon-\\ndents’ conspiracy convictions could stand if “proceeds” meant “profits,”\\nsee 461 F. 3d 866, 889 (CA7 2006), we do not address that possibility.\\n\\x0c4                    UNITED STATES v. SANTOS\\n\\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\\n\\ndefinition, but any preference is too slight for us to con-\\nclude that “receipts” is the primary meaning of “proceeds.”\\n   “Proceeds,” moreover, has not acquired a common mean-\\ning in the provisions of the Federal Criminal Code. Most\\nleave the term undefined. See, e.g., 18 U. S. C. §1963; 21\\nU. S. C. §853. Recognizing the word’s inherent ambiguity,\\nCongress has defined “proceeds” in various criminal provi-\\nsions, but sometimes has defined it to mean “receipts” and\\nsometimes “profits.” Compare 18 U. S. C. §2339C(e)(3)\\n(2000 ed., Supp. V) (receipts), §981(a)(2)(A) (2000 ed.)\\n(same), with §981(a)(2)(B) (profits).\\n   Since context gives meaning, we cannot say the money-\\nlaundering statute is truly ambiguous until we consider\\n“proceeds” not in isolation but as it is used in the federal\\nmoney-laundering statute. See United Sav. Assn. of Tex.\\nv. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S.\\n365, 371 (1988). The word appears repeatedly throughout\\nthe statute, but all of those appearances leave the ambigu-\\nity intact. Section 1956(a)(1) itself, for instance, makes\\nsense under either definition: one can engage in a finan-\\ncial transaction with either receipts or profits of a crime;\\none can intend to promote the carrying on of a crime with\\neither its receipts or its profits; and one can try to conceal\\nthe nature, location, etc., of either receipts or profits. The\\nsame is true of all the other provisions of this legislation in\\nwhich the term “proceeds” is used. They make sense\\nunder either definition. See, for example, §1956(a)(2)(B),\\nwhich speaks of “proceeds” represented by a “monetary\\ninstrument or funds.”\\n   JUSTICE ALITO’s dissent (the principal dissent) makes\\nmuch of the fact that 14 States that use and define the\\nword “proceeds” in their money-laundering statutes,2 the\\n——————\\n  2 The majority of States with money-laundering laws, in fact, use “pro-\\n\\nceeds” without defining it. See Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. §18–18–408 (2007);\\nFla. Stat. §896.101 (2006); Ga. Code Ann. §§7–1–911, 7–1–915 (2004);\\n\\x0c                     Cite as: 553 U.

We do not think this evidence shows that\\nthe drafters of the federal money-laundering statute used\\n“proceeds” as a term of art for “receipts.” Most of the state\\nlaws cited by the dissent, the Model Act, and the treaty\\npostdate the 1986 federal money-laundering statute by\\nseveral years, so Congress was not acting against the back-\\ndrop of those definitions when it enacted the federal stat-\\nute. If anything, they show that “proceeds” is ambiguous\\nand that others who believed that money-laundering stat-\\nutes ought to include gross receipts sought to clarify the\\nambiguity that Congress created when it left the term\\nundefined.3\\n——————\\nIdaho Code §18–8201 (Lexis 2004); Ill.

Courts in these States have not construed\\nthe term one way or the other. But cf. State v. Jackson, 124 S. W. 3d 139,\\n143 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2003) (linking “proceeds” with the defined term\\n“property”). California might belong in this list, for it has a money-\\nlaundering provision in its Penal Code, in which it uses the term\\n“proceeds” but does not define it. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. §186.10\\n(West 1999). But California also has a more limited money-laundering\\nstatute that uses and defines “proceeds.” See Cal. Health & Safety\\nCode Ann. §11370.9(h)(1) (West 2007). Maryland might belong on the\\nlist as well: Its general money-laundering statute defines “proceeds”\\nsimply to set a minimum value on the proceeds laundered, Md. Crim.\\nLaw Code Ann. §5–623(a)(5) (Lexis 2002) (“money or any other property\\nwith a value exceeding $10,000”), and its more limited money-\\nlaundering statute does not define the term, see §11–304.\\n   3 The principal dissent also suggests that Congress thought “proceeds”\\n\\nmeant “receipts” because the House of Representatives (but not the\\nSenate) had passed a money-laundering bill that did not use the word\\n\\x0c6                    UNITED STATES v. SANTOS\\n\\n                          Opinion of SCALIA, J.\\n\\n  Under either of the word’s ordinary definitions, all\\nprovisions of the federal money-laundering statute are\\ncoherent; no provisions are redundant; and the statute is\\nnot rendered utterly absurd. From the face of the statute,\\nthere is no more reason to think that “proceeds” means\\n“receipts” than there is to think that “proceeds” means\\n“profits.” Under a long line of our decisions, the tie must\\ngo to the defendant. The rule of lenity requires ambiguous\\ncriminal laws to be interpreted in favor of the defendants\\nsubjected to them. See United States v. Gradwell, 243\\nU. S. 476, 485 (1917); McBoyle v. United States, 283 U. S.\\n25, 27 (1931); United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 347–\\n349 (1971). This venerable rule not only vindicates the\\nfundamental principle that no citizen should be held\\naccountable for a violation of a statute whose commands\\nare uncertain, or subjected to punishment that is not\\nclearly prescribed. It also places the weight of inertia\\nupon the party that can best induce Congress to speak\\nmore clearly and keeps courts from making criminal law\\nin Congress’s stead. Because the “profits” definition of\\n“proceeds” is always more defendant-friendly than the\\n“receipts” definition, the rule of lenity dictates that it\\nshould be adopted.\\n                           III\\n  Stopping short of calling the “profits” interpretation\\nabsurd, the Government contends that the interpretation\\nshould nonetheless be rejected because it fails to give the\\n——————\\n“proceeds” but rather used and defined a term (“criminally derived\\nproperty”) that, perhaps, included receipts. See post, at 5, n. 5. Putting\\naside the question whether resort to legislative history is ever appropri-\\nate when interpreting a criminal statute, compare United States v.\\nR. L. C., 503 U.

On the Government’s view,\\n“[t]he gross receipts of a crime accurately reflect the scale\\nof the criminal activity, because the illegal activity gener-\\nated all of the funds.” Brief for United States 21; see also\\npost, at 5–7 (ALITO, J., dissenting).\\n   When interpreting a criminal statute, we do not play the\\npart of a mind reader. In our seminal rule-of-lenity\\ndecision, Chief Justice Marshall rejected the impulse to\\nspeculate regarding a dubious congressional intent.\\n“[P]robability is not a guide which a court, in construing a\\npenal statute, can safely take.” United States v. Wiltber-\\nger, 5 Wheat. 76, 105 (1820). And Justice Frankfurter,\\nwriting for the Court in another case, said the following:\\n“When Congress leaves to the Judiciary the task of imput-\\ning to Congress an undeclared will, the ambiguity should\\nbe resolved in favor of lenity.” Bell v. United States, 349\\nU. S. 81, 83 (1955).\\n   The statutory purpose advanced by the Government to\\nconstrue “proceeds” is a textbook example of begging the\\nquestion. To be sure, if “proceeds” meant “receipts,” one\\ncould say that the statute was aimed at the dangers of\\nconcealment and promotion. But whether “proceeds”\\nmeans “receipts” is the very issue in the case. If “pro-\\nceeds” means “profits,” one could say that the statute is\\naimed at the distinctive danger that arises from leaving in\\ncriminal hands the yield of a crime. A rational Congress\\ncould surely have decided that the risk of leveraging one\\n\\x0c8                UNITED STATES v.

S. C. §1955,\\nwould “merge” with the money-laundering statute. Con-\\ngress evidently decided that lottery operators ordinarily\\ndeserve up to 5 years of imprisonment, §1955(a), but as a\\nresult of merger they would face an additional 20 years,\\n§1956(a)(1). Prosecutors, of course, would acquire the\\ndiscretion to charge the lesser lottery offense, the greater\\nmoney-laundering offense, or both—which would pre-\\ndictably be used to induce a plea bargain to the lesser\\ncharge.\\n   The merger problem is not limited to lottery operators.\\nFor a host of predicate crimes, merger would depend on\\nthe manner and timing of payment for the expenses asso-\\nciated with the commission of the crime. Few crimes are\\nentirely free of cost, and costs are not always paid in\\nadvance. Anyone who pays for the costs of a crime with its\\nproceeds—for example, the felon who uses the stolen\\nmoney to pay for the rented getaway car—would violate\\nthe money-laundering statute. And any wealth-acquiring\\ncrime with multiple participants would become money-\\nlaundering when the initial recipient of the wealth gives\\n\\x0c                     Cite as: 553 U.

Moti-\\nvans, Money Laundering Offenders 1994–2001, p. 2 (2003),\\nonline at http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/mlo01.pdf (as\\nvisited May 29, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court’s\\ncase file), and many foreseeably entail such transactions,\\nsee 18 U. S. C. §1956(c)(7) (establishing as predicate of-\\nfenses a number of illegal trafficking and selling offenses,\\nthe expenses of which might be paid after the illegal\\ntransportation or sale).\\n   The Government suggests no explanation for why Con-\\ngress would have wanted a transaction that is a normal\\npart of a crime it had duly considered and appropriately\\npunished elsewhere in the Criminal Code to radically\\nincrease the sentence for that crime. Interpreting “pro-\\nceeds” to mean “profits” eliminates the merger problem.\\nTransactions that normally occur during the course of\\nrunning a lottery are not identifiable uses of profits and\\nthus do not violate the money-laundering statute. More\\ngenerally, a criminal who enters into a transaction paying\\nthe expenses of his illegal activity cannot possibly violate\\nthe money-laundering statute, because by definition prof-\\nits consist of what remains after expenses are paid. De-\\nfraying an activity’s costs with its receipts simply will not\\nbe covered.\\n——————\\n   4 The Solicitor General suggests that this is the case even under the\\n\\n“profits” interpretation. See Reply Brief for United States 16; see also\\npost, at 15–16 (ALITO, J., dissenting). That is not so, because when the\\n“loot” comes into the hands of the later distributing felon his confeder-\\nates’ shares are (as to him) not profits but mere receipts subject to his\\npayment of expenses.\\n\\x0c10                   UNITED STATES v. SANTOS\\n\\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\\n\\n   The principal dissent suggests that a solution to the\\nmerger problem may be found in giving a narrow interpre-\\ntation to the “promotion prong” of the statute: A defendant\\nmight be deemed not to “promote” illegal activity “by doing\\nthose things . . . that are needed merely to keep the busi-\\nness running,” post, at 18, because promotion (presuma-\\nbly) means doing things that will cause a business to grow.\\nSee Webster’s 2d, p. 1981 (giving as one of the meanings of\\n“promote” “[t]o contribute to the growth [or] enlargement”\\nof something). (This argument is embraced by JUSTICE\\nBREYER’s dissent as well. See post, at 2.) The federal\\nmoney-laundering statute, however, bars not the bare act\\nof promotion, but engaging in certain transactions “with\\nthe intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful\\nactivity.” 18 U. S. C. §1956(a)(1)(A)(i) (emphasis added).\\nIn that context the word naturally bears one of its other\\nmeanings, such as “[t]o contribute to the . . . prosperity” of\\nsomething, or to “further” something. See Webster’s 2d,\\np. 1981. Surely one promotes “the carrying on” of a gam-\\nbling enterprise by merely assuring that it continues in\\nbusiness.5 In any event, to believe that this “narrow”\\ninterpretation of “promote” would solve the merger prob-\\nlem one must share the dissent’s misperception that the\\nstatute applies just to the conduct of ongoing enterprises\\nrather than individual unlawful acts. If the predicate act\\nis theft by an individual, it makes no sense to ask whether\\nan expenditure was intended to “grow” the culprit’s theft\\n——————\\n  5 We note in passing the peculiarity that a dissent which rejects our\\n\\ninterpretation of “proceeds” because knowledge of profits will be diffi-\\ncult to prove, suggests an interpretation of “promotes” that will require\\nproving that a particular expenditure was intended, not merely to keep\\na business “running,” but to expand it. (“You must decide, ladies and\\ngentlemen of the jury, whether it is true beyond a reasonable doubt\\nthat the payoff of this winning bettor was not simply motivated by a\\ndesire to bring him and other current gambling customers back, but\\nwas meant to create a reputation for reliable payoff that would attract\\nfuture customers.”)\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 553 U.

The merger problem thus stands as a major\\nobstacle to the dissent’s interpretation of “proceeds.”\\n   JUSTICE BREYER admits that the merger problem casts\\ndoubt on the Government’s position, post, at 1, but be-\\nlieves there are “other, more legally felicitous” solutions to\\nthe problem, post, at 2. He suggests that the merger\\nproblem could be solved by holding that “the money laun-\\ndering offense and the underlying offense that generated\\nthe money to be laundered must be distinct in order to be\\nseparately punishable.” Ibid. The insuperable difficulty\\nwith this solution is that it has no basis whatever in the\\nwords of the statute. Even assuming (as one should not)\\nthe propriety of a judicial rewrite, why should one believe\\nthat Congress wanted courts to avoid the merger problem\\nin that unusual fashion, rather than by adopting one of\\nthe two possible meanings of an ambiguous term?\\nJUSTICE BREYER pins hope on the possibility, “if the\\n‘merger’ problem is essentially a problem of fairness in\\nsentencing,” that the United States Sentencing Commis-\\nsion might revise its recommended sentences for money\\nlaundering. Post, at 2–3. See also principal dissent, post,\\nat 17–18 (in agreement). Even if that is a possibility, it is\\nnot a certainty. And once again, why should one choose\\nthis chancy method of solving the problem, rather than\\ninterpret ambiguous language to avoid it? In any event,\\nas noted, supra, at 8, the merger problem affects more\\nthan just sentencing; it affects charging decisions and\\nplea-bargaining as well.\\n                              B\\n  The Government also argues for the “receipts” interpre-\\ntation because—quite frankly—it is easier to prosecute.\\nProving the proceeds and knowledge elements of the fed-\\neral money-laundering offense under the “profits” inter-\\npretation will unquestionably require proof that is more\\ndifficult to obtain. Essentially, the Government asks us to\\n\\x0c12                   UNITED STATES v.

That position turns the rule of lenity upside-\\ndown. We interpret ambiguous criminal statutes in favor\\nof defendants, not prosecutors.\\n   It is true that the “profits” interpretation demands more\\nfrom the Government than the “receipts” interpretation.\\nNot so much more, however, as to render such a disposi-\\ntion inconceivable—as proved by the fact that Congress\\nhas imposed similar proof burdens upon the prosecution\\nelsewhere. See 18 U. S. C. §1963(a) (criminal forfeiture\\nprovision requiring determination of “gross profits or other\\nproceeds”); 21 U. S. C. §853(a) (same).6 It is untrue that\\nthe added burdens “serve no discernible purpose.” Post, at\\n12 (ALITO, J., dissenting). They ensure that the severe\\nmoney-laundering penalties will be imposed only for the\\nremoval of profits from criminal activity, which permit the\\nleveraging of one criminal activity into the next. See\\nsupra, at 7–8.\\n   In any event, the Government exaggerates the difficul-\\nties. The “proceeds of specified unlawful activity” are the\\nproceeds from the conduct sufficient to prove one predicate\\noffense. Thus, to establish the proceeds element under the\\n“profits” interpretation, the prosecution needs to show\\nonly that a single instance of specified unlawful activity\\nwas profitable and gave rise to the money involved in a\\ncharged transaction. And the Government, of course, can\\nselect the instances for which the profitability is clearest.\\n——————\\n  6 The  principal dissent claims that these statutes do not require proof\\nof profits because the Government could rely upon the “other proceeds”\\nprong, which the dissent interprets to mean all proceeds, gross profits\\nand everything else. See post, at 16. We do not normally interpret a\\ntext in a manner that makes one of its provisions superfluous. But\\neven if we did, these provisions would still establish what the dissent\\nbelieves unthinkable: that Congress could envision the Government’s\\nproving profits.\\n\\x0c                     Cite as: 553 U.

That is typi-\\ncally defined as a “continuing series of violations,” 21\\nU. S. C. §848(c)(2), which would presumably be satisfied\\nby three violations, see Richardson v. United States, 526\\nU. S. 813, 818 (1999). Thus, the Government will have to\\nprove the profitability of just three offenses, selecting\\n(again) those for which profitability is clearest.

The answer is “as long as the Government\\nchooses to charge.” Title 18 U. S. C. §1955(a) provides that “[w]hoever\\nconducts, finances, manages, supervises, directs, or owns all or part of\\nan illegal gambling business shall be fined under this title or impris-\\noned not more than five years, or both.” An illegal gambling business is\\nan illegal gambling business during each moment of its operation, and\\nit will be up to the Government to select that period of time for which it\\ncan most readily establish the necessary elements of the charged\\noffenses, including (if money laundering is one of them) profitability.\\n(To the extent this raises the possibility of the Government’s making\\nmultiple violations out of one person’s running of a single business, that\\nproblem arises no matter what definition of “proceeds” is adopted.) The\\n“preposterous results” that the dissent attributes to our interpretation\\nof “proceeds,” post, at 14, are in fact the consequence of the Govern-\\nment’s decision to charge Santos with conducting a gambling business\\nover a 6-year period. Of course in the vast majority of cases, establish-\\ning the profitability of the predicate offense will not put the Govern-\\nment to the task of identifying the relevant period. Most criminal\\nstatutes prohibit discrete, individual acts (fraud, bank robbery) rather\\nthan the conduct of a business.\\n\\x0c14                   UNITED STATES v. SANTOS\\n\\n                         Opinion of SCALIA, J.\\n\\nlying crimes instead of the overarching enterprise crime.\\n  As for the knowledge element of the money-laundering\\noffense—knowledge that the transaction involves profits of\\nunlawful activity—that will be provable (as knowledge\\nmust almost always be proved) by circumstantial evidence.\\nFor example, someone accepting receipts from what he\\nknows to be a long-continuing drug-dealing operation can\\nbe found to know that they include some profits. And a\\njury could infer from a long-running launderer-criminal\\nrelationship that the launderer knew he was hiding the\\ncriminal’s profits. Moreover, the Government will be\\nentitled to a willful blindness instruction if the profes-\\nsional money launderer, aware of a high probability that\\nthe laundered funds were profits, deliberately avoids\\nlearning the truth about them—as might be the case when\\nhe knows that the underlying crime is one that is rarely\\nunprofitable.\\n                             IV\\n  Concurring in the judgment, JUSTICE STEVENS ex-\\npresses the view that the rule of lenity applies to this case\\nbecause there is no legislative history reflecting any legis-\\nlator’s belief about how the money-laundering statute\\nshould apply to lottery operators. See post, at 3, 5. The\\nrule of lenity might not apply, he thinks, in a case involv-\\ning an organized crime syndicate or the sale of contraband\\nbecause the legislative history supposedly contains some\\nviews on the meaning of “proceeds” in those circum-\\nstances.8 See post, at 2–3, and n. 3. In short, JUSTICE\\n——————\\n  8 JUSTICE STEVENS fails to identify the legislative history to which he\\nrefers. He offers only: “As JUSTICE ALITO rightly argues, the legislative\\nhistory of §1956 makes it clear that Congress intended the term ‘pro-\\nceeds’ to include gross revenues from the sale of contraband and the\\noperation of organized crime syndicates involving such sales.” Post, at\\n2–3. Although JUSTICE ALITO, from one item of legislative history,\\ndraws an inference about the meaning of “proceeds” in all its applica-\\ntions (which we find dubious, see n. 3, supra), nowhere does he cite\\n\\x0c                    Cite as: 553 U.

JUSTICE STEVENS relies on the\\nproposition that one undefined word, repeated in different\\nstatutory provisions, can have different meanings in each\\nprovision. See post, at 2, and n. 2. But that is worlds\\napart from giving the same word, in the same statutory\\nprovision, different meanings in different factual contexts.\\nNot only have we never engaged in such interpretive\\ncontortion; just over three years ago, in an opinion joined\\nby JUSTICE STEVENS, we forcefully rejected it. Clark v.\\nMartinez, 543 U. S. 371 (2005), held that the meaning of\\nwords in a statute cannot change with the statute’s appli-\\ncation. See id., at 378. To hold otherwise “would render\\nevery statute a chameleon,” id., at 382, and “would estab-\\nlish within our jurisprudence . . . the dangerous principle\\nthat judges can give the same statutory text different\\nmeanings in different cases,” id., at 386. Precisely to avoid\\nthat result, our cases often “give a statute’s ambiguous\\nlanguage a limiting construction called for by one of the\\nstatute’s applications, even though other of the statute’s\\napplications, standing alone, would not support the same\\nlimitation. The lowest common denominator, as it were,\\nmust govern.” Id., at 380 (emphasis added).\\n   Our obligation to maintain the consistent meaning of\\nwords in statutory text does not disappear when the rule\\nof lenity is involved. To the contrary, we have resolved an\\nambiguity in a tax statute in favor of the taxpayer in a\\ncivil case because the statute had criminal applications\\n\\n——————\\nlegislative history addressing the meaning of the word “proceeds” in\\ncases specifically involving contraband or organized crime. Thus\\nJUSTICE STEVENS’ concurrence appears to address not only a hypotheti-\\ncal case, see infra, at 16, but even an imagined legislative history.\\n\\x0c16               UNITED STATES v.

S. 505, 517–518, and\\nn. 10 (1992) (plurality opinion). If anything, the rule of\\nlenity is an additional reason to remain consistent, lest\\nthose subject to the criminal law be misled. And even if,\\nas JUSTICE STEVENS contends, post, at 1, statutory ambi-\\nguity “effectively” licenses us to write a brand-new law, we\\ncannot accept that power in a criminal case, where the law\\nmust be written by Congress. See United States v. Hud-\\nson, 7 Cranch 32, 34 (1812).\\n   We think it appropriate to add a word concerning the\\nstare decisis effect of JUSTICE STEVENS’ opinion. Since his\\nvote is necessary to our judgment, and since his opinion\\nrests upon the narrower ground, the Court’s holding is\\nlimited accordingly. See Marks v. United States, 430 U. S.\\n188, 193 (1977). But the narrowness of his ground con-\\nsists of finding that “proceeds” means “profits” when there\\nis no legislative history to the contrary. That is all that\\nour judgment holds. It does not hold that the outcome is\\ndifferent when contrary legislative history does exist.\\nJUSTICE STEVENS’ speculations on that point address a\\ncase that is not before him, are the purest of dicta, and\\nform no part of today’s holding. Thus, as far as this par-\\nticular statute is concerned, counsel remain free to argue\\nJUSTICE STEVENS’ view (and to explain why it does not\\noverrule Clark v. Martinez, supra). They should be\\nwarned, however: Not only do the Justices joining this\\nopinion reject that view, but so also (apparently) do the\\nJustices joining the principal dissent.

In fact, in the general civil forfeiture statute, §981,\\nCongress did provide two different definitions of “pro-\\nceeds,” recognizing that—for a subset of activities—\\n“proceeds” must allow for the deduction of costs. Compare\\n§981(a)(2)(A) (2000 ed.) (defining “proceeds” in cases in-\\nvolving illegal goods and services to mean “property of any\\nkind obtained directly or indirectly . . . not limited to the\\nnet gain or profit realized from the offense”) with\\n§981(a)(2)(B) (defining “proceeds” with respect to lawful\\ngoods sold in an illegal manner as the amount of money\\nacquired “less the direct costs incurred in providing the\\ngoods or services”).\\n   We have previously recognized that the same word can\\nhave different meanings in the same statute.2 If Congress\\ncould have expressly defined the term “proceeds” differ-\\nently when applied to different specified unlawful activi-\\nties, it seems to me that judges filling the gap in a statute\\nwith such a variety of applications may also do so, as long\\nas they are conscientiously endeavoring to carry out the\\nintent of Congress. Therefore, contrary to what JUSTICE\\nALITO and the plurality state, see post, at 17 (dissenting\\nopinion); ante, at 15-16 (plurality opinion), this Court need\\nnot pick a single definition of “proceeds” applicable to\\nevery unlawful activity, no matter how incongruous some\\napplications may be.\\n   As JUSTICE ALITO rightly argues, the legislative history\\nof §1956 makes it clear that Congress intended the term\\n“proceeds” to include gross revenues from the sale of con-\\ntraband and the operation of organized crime syndicates\\n\\n——————\\n    2 See,\\n         e.g., General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v.

For example, one specified unlaw-\\nful activity is the conduct proscribed by §541, “Entry of\\ngoods falsely classified.”      Section 541 provides that\\n“[w]hoever knowingly effects any entry of goods, wares, or\\nmerchandise, at less than the true weight or measure\\nthereof, or upon a false classification as to quality or\\nvalue, or by the payment of less than the amount of duty\\nlegally due, shall be . . . imprisoned not more than two\\nyears.” Conceivably the “proceeds” stemming from a\\nviolation of §541 could be either the money realized by\\nmisstating the value—that is, the amount by which the\\ncriminal “profits” by paying reduced duties—or the total\\nprice at which the goods are later sold, even though the\\nmisclassification had only a trivial impact on that price.\\n   Just as the legislative history fails to tell us how to\\ncalculate the “proceeds” of violations of §541, it is equally\\nsilent on the proceeds of an unlicensed stand-alone gam-\\nbling venture. The consequences of applying a “gross\\nreceipts” definition of “proceeds” to the gambling operation\\nconducted by respondents are so perverse that I cannot\\nbelieve they were contemplated by Congress, particularly\\ngiven the fact that nothing in JUSTICE ALITO’s thorough\\nreview of the legislative history indicates otherwise.4\\n   Constrained by a holding that the payment of expenses\\nconstitutes “promotion,”5 JUSTICE ALITO’s opinion runs\\n——————\\n  3 Thus, I cannot agree with the plurality that the rule of lenity must\\n\\napply to the definition of “proceeds” for these types of unlawful activities.\\n  4 As JUSTICE ALITO notes, some reference was made in the legislative\\n\\nhistory to gambling as a part of a broader criminal syndicate’s activities.\\nPost, at 10. But that reference does not indicate that Congress intended\\nthe “proceeds” of a gambling business to include gross receipts.\\n  5 The Seventh Circuit held on a prior appeal that respondent Santos’\\n\\nactions were legally sufficient to convict him of promoting the carrying\\non of a business under §1956, United States v. Febus, 218 F. 3d 784,\\n789–790 (2000). JUSTICE ALITO criticizes the plurality for allowing the\\n\\x0c4                   UNITED STATES v. SANTOS\\n\\n                 STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment\\n\\nsquarely into what can be characterized as the “merger”\\nproblem. Allowing the Government to treat the mere\\npayment of the expense of operating an illegal gambling\\nbusiness as a separate offense is in practical effect tanta-\\nmount to double jeopardy, which is particularly unfair in\\nthis case because the penalties for money laundering are\\nsubstantially more severe than those for the underlying\\noffense of operating a gambling business. A money laun-\\ndering conviction increases the statutory maximum from 5\\nto 20 years, and the Sentencing Commission has pre-\\nscribed different Guidelines ranges for the two crimes.6\\nWhen a defendant has a significant criminal history or\\nGuidelines enhancements apply, the statutory cap of five\\nyears in §1955 is an important limitation on a defendant’s\\nsentence—a limitation that would be eviscerated if\\nJUSTICE ALITO’s definition of “proceeds” were applied in\\nthis case.\\n  JUSTICE ALITO and JUSTICE BREYER suggest that the\\nadvisory nature of the Guidelines post-Booker, United\\nStates v. Booker, 543 U. S. 220 (2005), or the possibility of\\nan amendment to the money laundering Guideline, would\\nsoften this blow, post, at 17-18 (opinion of ALITO, J.); post,\\nat 2–3 (opinion of BREYER, J.), and indeed they could. But\\n——————\\ninterpretation of “proceeds” to be “dictated by an unreviewed interpre-\\ntation of another statutory element.” See post, at 18. I do not base my\\nopinion on any disagreement with the interpretation of “promotion.”\\n  6 For example, under the 2007 Guidelines, the base offense level for\\n\\nrunning a gambling business is 12. United States Sentencing Commis-\\nsion, Guidelines Manual §2E3.1 (Nov. 2007) (USSG). Section 2S1.1,\\nwhich provides the base offense level for money laundering, adds 2\\nlevels to the base offense level for the underlying crime where the\\ndefendant is convicted under 18 U. S. C. §1956. This scheme for\\ndetermining the base offense level first appeared in the November 2001\\nSentencing Guidelines. Prior to 2001, the difference between sentences\\nfor gambling and money laundering was even more pronounced, as\\nUSSG §2S1.1 (Nov. 2000) set an offense level of 23, which could be\\nincreased if the value of the funds exceeded $100,000.\\n\\x0c                     Cite as: 553 U.

If JUSTICE ALITO’s opinion were to carry the day,\\nboth respondents would return to prison to serve the\\nremainder of their lengthy sentences.\\n  The revenue generated by a gambling business that is\\nused to pay the essential expenses of operating that busi-\\nness is not “proceeds” within the meaning of the money\\nlaundering statute. As the plurality notes, there is “no\\nexplanation for why Congress would have wanted a trans-\\naction that is a normal part of a crime it had duly consid-\\nered and appropriately punished elsewhere in the Crimi-\\nnal Code, to radically increase the sentence for that\\ncrime.” Ante, at 9. This conclusion dovetails with what\\ncommon sense and the rule of lenity would require. Faced\\nwith both a lack of legislative history speaking to the\\ndefinition of “proceeds” when operating a gambling busi-\\nness is the “specified unlawful activity” and my conviction\\nthat Congress could not have intended the perverse result\\nthat would obtain in this case under JUSTICE ALITO’s\\nopinion, the rule of lenity may weigh in the determination.\\nAnd in that respect the plurality’s opinion is surely per-\\nsuasive.7 Accordingly, I concur in the judgment.\\n——————\\n   7 In what can only be characterized as the “purest of dicta,” the plu-\\n\\nrality speculates about the stare decisis effect of our judgment and\\ninterprets my conclusion as resting on the ground that “ ‘proceeds’\\nmeans ‘profits’ when there is no legislative history to the contrary.”\\nAnte, at 16. That is not correct; my conclusion rests on my conviction\\nthat Congress could not have intended the perverse result that the\\ndissent’s rule would produce if its definition of “proceeds” were applied\\nto the operation of an unlicensed gambling business. In other applica-\\ntions of the statute not involving such a perverse result, I would pre-\\nsume that the legislative history summarized by JUSTICE ALITO reflects\\nthe intent of the enacting Congress. See post, at 2 and n. 1 (opinion of\\nALITO, J.).

Like\\nthe plurality, I doubt that Congress intended the money\\nlaundering statute automatically to cover financial trans-\\nactions that constitute an essential part of a different\\nunderlying crime. Operating an illegal gambling business,\\nfor example, inevitably involves investment in overhead as\\nwell as payments to employees and winning customers; a\\ndrug offense normally involves payment for drugs; and\\nbank robbery may well require the distribution of stolen\\ncash to confederates. If the money laundering statute\\napplies to this kind of transaction (i.e., if the transaction is\\nautomatically a “financial transaction” that “involves the\\nproceeds of specified unlawful activity” made “with the\\nintent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful\\nactivity”), then the Government can seek a heavier money\\nlaundering penalty (say, 20 years), even though the only\\nconduct at issue is conduct that warranted a lighter pen-\\nalty (say, 5 years for illegal gambling). 18 U. S. C.\\n§1956(a)(1).\\n   It is difficult to understand why Congress would have\\nintended the Government to possess this punishment-\\ntransforming power. Perhaps for this reason, the Tenth\\n\\x0c2                UNITED STATES v. SANTOS\\n\\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\\n\\nCircuit has written that “Congress aimed the crime of\\nmoney laundering at conduct that follows in time the\\nunderlying crime rather than to afford an alternative\\nmeans of punishing the prior ‘specified unlawful activity.’ ”\\nUnited States v. Edgmon, 952 F. 2d 1206, 1214 (1991).\\nAnd, in 1997, the United States Sentencing Commission\\ntold Congress that it agreed with the Department of Jus-\\ntice that “money laundering cannot properly be charged\\nfor ‘merged’ transactions that are part of the underly-\\ning crime.” Report to Congress: Sentencing Policy for\\nMoney Laundering Offenses, including Comments on a\\nDept. of Justice Report, p. 16 (Sept. 1997), online at http://\\nwww.ussc.gov/r_congress/launder.pdf (as visited May 20,\\n2008, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).\\n   Thus, like the plurality, I see a “merger” problem. But,\\nunlike the plurality, I do not believe that we should look to\\nthe word “proceeds” for a solution. For one thing, the\\nplurality’s interpretation of that word creates the serious\\nlogical and practical difficulties that JUSTICE ALITO de-\\nscribes. See post, at 7–12 (dissenting opinion) (describing\\ndifficulties associated with proof and accounting). For\\nanother thing, there are other, more legally felicitous\\nplaces to look for a solution. The Tenth Circuit, for exam-\\nple, has simply held that the money laundering offense\\nand the underlying offense that generated the money to be\\nlaundered must be distinct in order to be separately pun-\\nishable. Edgmon, supra, at 1214. Alternatively the\\nmoney laundering statute’s phrase “with the intent to\\npromote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity”\\nmay not apply where, for example, only one instance of\\nthat underlying activity is at issue. (The Seventh Circuit\\non a prior appeal in this case rejected that argument, and\\nthus we do not consider it here. See United States v.\\nFebus, 218 F. 3d 784, 789 (2000).)\\n   Finally, if the “merger” problem is essentially a problem\\nof fairness in sentencing, the Sentencing Commission has\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 553 U.

Congress has instructed\\nthe Commission to “avoi[d] unwarranted sentencing dis-\\nparities” among those “found guilty of similar criminal\\nconduct.” 28 U. S. C. §991(b)(1)(B) (emphasis added); see\\nalso §994(f) (instructing the Commission to pay particular\\nattention to those disparities). The current money laun-\\ndering Guideline, United States Sentencing Commission,\\nGuidelines Manual §2S1.1 (Nov. 2007) (USSG), by making\\nno exception for a situation where nothing but a single\\ninstance of the underlying crime has taken place, would\\nseem to create a serious and unwarranted disparity among\\ndefendants who have engaged in identical conduct. My\\nhope is that the Commission’s past efforts to tie more\\nclosely the offense level for money laundering to the of-\\nfense level of the underlying crime, see id., Supp. to App.\\nC, Amdt. 634 (Nov. 2001), suggest a willingness to con-\\nsider directly this kind of disparity. Such an approach\\ncould solve the “merger” problem without resort to creat-\\ning complex interpretations of the statute’s language. And\\nany such solution could be applied retroactively. See 28\\nU. S. C. §994(u).\\n  In light of these alternative possibilities, I dissent.\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 553 U.

Rather, the next thing to do is to ask\\nwhat the term “proceeds” customarily means in the con-\\ntext that is relevant here—a money laundering statute.\\n  The federal money laundering statute is not the only\\nmoney laundering provision that uses the term “proceeds.”\\nOn the contrary, the term is a staple of money laundering\\n——————\\n    1 In\\n       light of the plurality opinion’s discussion of “the stare decisis\\neffect of JUSTICE STEVENS’ opinion,” ante, at 16, it must be noted that\\nfive Justices agree with the position taken by JUSTICE STEVENS on the\\nmatter discussed in the preceding sentence of the text.\\n\\x0c                     Cite as: 553 U.

It strongly suggests\\nthat when lawmakers, knowledgeable about the nature\\nand problem of money laundering, use the term “proceeds”\\nin a money laundering provision, they customarily mean\\nfor the term to reach all receipts and not just profits.5\\n                             B\\n  There is a very good reason for this uniform pattern of\\nusage. Money laundering provisions serve two chief ends.\\nFirst, they provide deterrence by preventing drug traffick-\\ners and other criminals who amass large quantities of cash\\n\\n——————\\n  The only state money laundering statute the even uses the term\\n“profits,” “net income,” or something similar is that of Arkansas, which\\nplainly defines “criminal proceeds” to include all gross receipts of\\ncriminal conduct: “ ‘Criminal proceeds’ means: (A) Anything of value\\nfurnished or intended to be furnished in exchange for criminal conduct\\nor contraband received in violation of state or federal law; and (B)\\nProperty or profits traceable to” such an exchange. Ark. Code Ann. §5–\\n42–203(5) (2006).\\n  5 The version of the money laundering statute originally passed by\\n\\nthe House reflected a similar legislative judgment. The bill made it a\\ncrime to engage in financial transactions and certain commercial\\ntransactions involving “criminally derived property that is derived from\\na designated offense.” H. R. 5484, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., §602, p. 154\\n(1986) (as introduced). The term “criminally derived property” is\\nnaturally understood to include all property that is “receive[d]” or\\n“obtain[ed]” as a result of criminal activity, see Webster’s 3d 609;\\nRandom House Dictionary of the English Language 389 (1967), and\\nthus to include all gross receipts and not just profit. The House bill\\ndefined the term “criminally derived property” to mean “any property\\nconstituting, or derived from, proceeds obtained from a criminal of-\\nfense.” H. R. 5484, §602, at 158 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the\\nHouse seems to have understood “proceeds” to include gross receipts.\\n  The bill passed by the Senate, like the current money laundering\\nstatute, simply used the term “proceeds,” S. 2683, 99th Cong., 2d Sess.,\\n§2(a) (1986), and the House acceded to the Senate version. See H. R.\\n5484, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., §1352, p. 48 (1986) (as enacted).

And illegal enterprises\\nmay acquire such cash while engaging in unlawful activity\\nthat is unprofitable.\\n   Suppose, for example, that a drug cartel sends a large\\nshipment of drugs to this country, a good part of the ship-\\nment is intercepted, the remainder is sold, the cartel ends\\nup with a net loss but with a large quantity of cash on its\\nhands, and the cartel uses the cash in financial transac-\\ntions that are designed to conceal the source of the cash or\\nto promote further crime. There is no plausible reason\\nwhy Congress would not have wanted the money launder-\\ning statute to apply to these financial transactions. If the\\ncartel leaders use the money to live in luxury, this pro-\\nvides an incentive for these individuals to stay in the\\nbusiness and for others to enter. If the cartel uses the\\nmoney to finance future drug shipments or to expand the\\nbusiness, public safety is harmed.\\n\\x0c                  Cite as: 553 U.

A criminal op-\\neration that consistently loses money will not last very\\nlong and thus presents a lesser danger than a profitable\\noperation. But narrowing a money laundering statute so\\nthat it reaches only profits produces two perverse results\\nthat Congress cannot have wanted. First, it immunizes\\nsuccessful criminal enterprises during those periods when\\nthey are operating temporarily in the red. Second, and\\nmore important, it introduces pointless and difficult prob-\\nlems of proof. Because the dangers presented by money\\nlaundering are present whenever criminals have large\\nstores of illegally derived funds on their hands, there is\\nlittle reason to require proof—which may be harder to\\nassemble than the plurality opinion acknowledges—that\\nthe funds represent profits.\\n                             C\\n  The implausibility of a net income interpretation is\\nhighlighted in cases involving professionals and others\\nwho are hired to launder money. Those who are knowl-\\nedgeable about money laundering stress the importance of\\nprosecuting these hired money launderers.

S. C. §1956(a), a de-\\nfendant must “kno[w] the property involved in a financial\\ntransaction represents the proceeds of some form of\\nunlawful activity.” A professional money launderer is not\\nlikely to know (or perhaps even to care) whether the en-\\nterprise is operating in the black when the funds in ques-\\ntion were acquired. Therefore, under a net income inter-\\npretation, financial specialists and others who are hired to\\nlaunder funds would generally be beyond the reach of the\\nstatute, something that Congress almost certainly did not\\nintend.\\n   It is revealing that the money laundering statute explic-\\nitly provides that a money launderer need only know that\\n“the property involved in the transaction represented\\nproceeds from some form, though not necessarily which\\nform, of [specified illegal] activity.” §1956(c)(1). Thus, the\\nprosecution is not required to prove that a hired money\\nlaunderer knew that funds provided for laundering de-\\nrived from, say, drug sales as opposed to gambling. There\\nis no reason to think that hired money launderers are\\nmore likely to know whether funds include profits than\\nthey are to know the nature of the illegal activity from\\nwhich the funds were derived. Consequently, §1956(c)\\nsuggests that Congress did not intend to require proof that\\na hired money launderer knew that funds provided for\\nlaundering included profits.\\n   The plurality opinion dismisses these concerns with the\\nobservation that a jury may infer that a hired launderer\\nknew that funds included profits if the launderer had a\\nlong-running relationship with the entity or person provid-\\ning the funds or knew that the entity or person had been\\ninvolved in the illegal enterprise for a lengthy period. See\\nante, at 14. But what about the case where the launderer\\naccepts a million dollars of drug money on a single occa-\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 553 U.

And even if there would be legally sufficient evi-\\ndence to support an inference of the requisite knowledge\\nunder the circumstances that the plurality opinion posits,\\nthe requirement of convincing a jury to find beyond a\\nreasonable doubt that the funds included profits would\\npose a troublesome and (in light of the aim of the money\\nlaundering statute) pointless obstacle.\\n                              D\\n   Even in cases in which the defendants are alleged to\\nhave been involved in the underlying criminal activity, a\\nnet income interpretation would produce nettlesome prob-\\nlems that Congress cannot have wanted. These problems\\nmay be especially acute in the very cases that money\\nlaundering statutes principally target, that is, cases in-\\nvolving large-scale criminal operations that continue over\\na substantial period of time, particularly drug cartels and\\nother organized crime syndicates.\\n   The federal money laundering statute was enacted in\\nthe wake of an influential report by the President’s Com-\\nmission on Organized Crime that focused squarely on\\ncriminal enterprises of this type. See Interim Report 7–8\\n(described in S. Rep. No. 99–433, pp. 2–4 (1986) (hereinaf-\\nter S. Rep.) and H. R. Rep., at 16). The Commission iden-\\ntified drug traffickers and other organized criminal groups\\nas presenting the most serious problems. See Interim\\nReport 7. The Commission found that “narcotics traffick-\\ners, who must conceal billions of dollars in cash from\\ndetection by the government, create by far the greatest\\ndemand for money laundering services” but that “numer-\\nous other types of activities typical of organized crime,\\nsuch as loansharking and gambling, also create an appre-\\nciable demand for such schemes.” Ibid. To illustrate the\\nscope and nature of the money laundering problem, a\\nsection of the Interim Report was devoted to case studies,\\nmost of which involved the laundering of drug money.

In that case, the evidence showed that the\\nSicilian Mafia and organized crime elements in the United\\nStates, over a period of many years, imported huge\\namounts of heroin into this country, sold the heroin here,\\naccumulated millions of dollars of cash, and then laun-\\ndered the funds by smuggling them overseas in suitcases\\nor funneling the money through a maze of bank accounts.\\nSee id., at 31–35; United States v. Casamento, 887 F. 2d\\n1141, 1148–1149 (CA2 1989).\\n   Following the issuance of the Interim Report, Congress\\nturned its attention to the problem of money laundering,\\nand much of the discussion focused on the need to prevent\\nlaundering by drug and organized crime syndicates. See,\\ne.g., S. Rep., at 3 (discussing “organized crime ‘businesses’\\nsuch as gambling, prostitution, and loansharking”), 4\\n(“Money laundering is a crucial financial underpinning of\\norganized crime and narcotics trafficking” (internal quota-\\ntion marks omitted)); Hearing on Money Laundering\\nLegislation before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary,\\n99th Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1985) (statement of Chairman\\nThurmond); id., at 29 (statement of Sen. Biden), 30 (state-\\nment of Sen. DeConcini), 31 (statement of Sen. D’Amato),\\n53 (statement of Assistant Attorney General Trott).\\n   In light of these concerns, it is most unlikely that Con-\\ngress meant to enact a money laundering statute that\\nwould present daunting obstacles in the very sort of cases\\nthat had been identified as presenting the most pressing\\nproblems, that is, cases, like the “Pizza Connection” case,\\nin which law enforcement intercepts cash or wire transfers\\nof funds derived from drug sales or other unlawful activity\\nthat occurred over a period of time. The plurality opin-\\nion’s interpretation of the term “proceeds,” however, would\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 553 U.

Tracing funds back to par-\\nticular drug sales and proving that these sales were prof-\\nitable will often prove impossible. See United States v.\\nBajakajian, 524 U. S. 321, 351–352 (1998) (KENNEDY, J.,\\ndissenting). Indeed, it will often be hard even to establish\\nwith any precision the period of time during which the\\ndrug sales occurred. But assuming that the Government\\ncan prove roughly when the funds were acquired, the next\\nhurdle would be to show that the drug ring had net income\\nduring the time when the funds were acquired.\\n   “Net income” means “[t]he excess of revenues over all\\nrelated expenses for a given period.” R. Estes, Dictionary\\nof Accounting 88 (1981) (emphasis deleted). There are no\\ngenerally accepted accounting principles for determining\\nthe net income of illegal enterprises, and therefore, in\\norder to apply a net income interpretation, special ac-\\ncounting rules would have to be developed.\\n   In the drug-money cases that I have been discussing,\\nthe courts would have to decide whether the drug syndi-\\ncate’s net income should be calculated on an annual, quar-\\nterly, or some other basis. In addition, the courts would be\\nforced to devise rules for determining the scope of the\\nenterprise for which the net income calculation must be\\nperformed. Suppose, for example, that there were connec-\\ntions of an uncertain nature or degree between drug op-\\nerations in different cities or countries. Rules would be\\nneeded to determine whether affiliated criminal groups\\nshould be regarded as one enterprise or several. And proof\\nregarding the connections between such operations would\\noften be very difficult to obtain. Criminal enterprises do\\nnot have papers of incorporation, partnership agreements,\\nor (in most instances) other documents establishing pre-\\ncise business relationships.\\n   Rules would also be needed in order to determine\\nwhether particular illegal expenditures should be consid-\\nered as expenses. In the “Pizza Connection” case, the\\n\\x0c12               UNITED STATES v. SANTOS\\n\\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\\n\\nSicilian Mafia used its income for such things as the mur-\\nder of magistrates, police officers, witnesses, and rivals.\\nSee, e.g., Casamento, supra, at 1154–1156; United States\\nv. Gambino, 809 F. Supp. 1061, 1065–1068 (SDNY 1992).\\nAre these expenditures simply a cost of engaging in the\\ndrug trade? Are they business expenses?\\n   If a net income interpretation were taken to its logical\\nconclusion, it presumably would be necessary as well to\\nwork out rules for the depreciation of instrumentalities of\\ncrime that must occasionally be replaced due to the efforts\\nof law enforcement. But it seems quite implausible that\\nCongress wanted courts or juries in money laundering\\ncases to grapple with questions such as the useful life of,\\nsay, a drug processing plant or laboratory or the airplanes\\nand boats that are used to smuggle drugs. And assuming\\nthat the accounting issues can ultimately be resolved by\\nthe courts, there would remain serious problems of proof.\\nIllegal enterprises generally do not keep books and records\\nlike legitimate businesses do.\\n   It is tempting to dismiss many of the problems noted\\nabove on the ground that “everyone knows” that drug\\ncartels, organized crime syndicates, and the like make a\\nprofit. But such groups may not operate in the black at all\\ntimes, and in any event, if net income is an element of the\\nmoney laundering offense, the prosecution must prove net\\nincome beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecution can-\\nnot simply ask the jury to take notice of the fact that these\\ngroups are profitable.\\n   My point in citing the accounting and proof problems\\nthat would be produced by a net income interpretation is\\nnot that the “ ‘receipts’ ” interpretation is preferable be-\\ncause “it is easier to prosecute,” ante, at 11 (plurality\\nopinion), but that creating these obstacles would serve no\\ndiscernible purpose. Even if a drug or gambling ring was\\ntemporarily operating in the red during a particular pe-\\nriod, the laundering of money acquired during that time\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 553 U. S. ____ (2008)           13\\n\\n                     ALITO, J., dissenting\\n\\nwould present the same dangers as the laundering of\\nmoney acquired during times of profit. It is therefore\\nimplausible that Congress wanted to throw up such point-\\nless obstacles.\\n   The plurality opinion attempts to minimize all these\\nproblems by stating that “to establish the proceeds ele-\\nment under the ‘profits’ interpretation, the prosecution\\nneeds to show only that a single instance of specified\\nunlawful activity was profitable and gave rise to the\\nmoney involved in a charged transaction.” Ante, at 12.\\nThis suggestion ignores both the language of the money\\nlaundering statute, which makes no reference to an “in-\\nstance” of unlawful activity, and the realities of money\\nlaundering prosecutions. The prototypical money launder-\\ning case is not a case in which a defendant engages in a\\nsingle, discrete criminal act and then launders the money\\nderived from that act—for example, a case in which a\\n“felon . . . uses . . . stolen money to pay for the rented\\ngetaway car.” Ante, at 8. Rather, the prototypical case\\ninvolves numerous criminal acts that occur over a period\\nof time and the accumulation of funds from all these acts\\nprior to laundering—for example, the organized crime\\nsyndicate or drug cartel that amasses large sums before\\nengaging in a laundering transaction.\\n   Take, for example, a case in which a defendant is\\ncharged with doing what was done in the “Pizza Connec-\\ntion” case—transferring millions of dollars of drug money\\noverseas, knowing that the funds represent the proceeds of\\ndrug trafficking (“some form of unlawful activity”) and\\nthat the transfer was designed to conceal the origin of the\\nfunds. See 18 U. S. C. §1956(a)(2)(B)(2). In such a case, it\\nis unrealistic to think that individual dollars can be traced\\nback to individual drug sales—or that Congress wanted to\\nrequire such tracing.\\n   Although the plurality opinion begins by touting the\\n“single instance” theory as a cure for the accounting and\\n\\x0c14                 UNITED STATES v. SANTOS\\n\\n                       ALITO, J., dissenting\\n\\nproof problems that a “profits” interpretation produces,\\nthe plurality’s application of the “single instance” theory to\\nthe case at hand shows that this theory will not work. In\\nthis case, the “unlawful activity” that produced the funds\\nat issue in the substantive money laundering counts was\\nthe operation of the Santos lottery,6 and it is hardly ap-\\nparent what constitutes a “single instance” of running a\\ngambling business. Did each lottery drawing represent a\\nseparate “instance”? Each wager? And how long does\\neach gambling “instance” last? A day? A week? A month?\\n  When the plurality opinion addresses these questions, it\\nturns out that “a single instance” means all instances that\\nare charged, i.e., it means that the Government had to\\nshow that receipts exceeded costs during the time the\\ndefendant allegedly conducted, financed, etc., the gam-\\nbling operation. See ante, at 13, n. 7. Here, since the\\nIndictment alleged that the Santos lottery continued for\\nmore than 6 years (“[b]egining in or about January 1989\\nand continuing to in or about December 1994, the exact\\ndates being unknown to the Grand Jury”),7 the plurality\\nwould apparently compel the Government to prove that\\nthe lottery was profitable over this entire period.\\n  If this is where the “single instance” theory leads, the\\ntheory plainly does not solve the accounting and proof\\nproblems we have noted. And the plurality’s suggestion\\nthat the Government had to show that the gambling op-\\neration was profitable for this entire period leads to pre-\\nposterous results.

According to the\\nplurality, if respondents were found to have operated the\\nlottery during the entire 6-year period, then the financial\\ntransactions that occurred at the end of years one, two,\\nthree, four, and five would not violate the money launder-\\ning statute, even though an accounting done at those\\ntimes would have come to the conclusion that the funds\\nincluded profits. That result makes no sense.\\n   Whenever a money laundering indictment charges that\\nthe laundered funds derived from an “unlawful activity”\\nthat comprehends numerous acts that occurred over a\\nconsiderable period of time—and that is precisely the\\nsituation in many of the types of cases that the money\\nlaundering statute principally targeted—the plurality\\nopinion’s interpretation will produce difficulties. I have\\nalready discussed drug and gambling cases, and similar\\nproblems will arise in cases in which the unlawful activity\\nis a form of fraud. For example, the unlawful activity in\\nmail fraud (18 U. S. C. §1341) is the scheme to defraud,\\nnot the individual mailings carried out in furtherance of\\nthe scheme. See Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 19\\n(1999); United States v. Mankarious, 151 F. 3d 694 (CA7\\n1998). In such a case, what will constitute the “single\\ninstance of unlawful activity”? Will each mailing be a\\nseparate “instance”? The same problem arises with other\\nfraud predicates, including wire fraud (§1343), see, e.g.,\\nUnited States v. Zvi, 168 F. 3d 49 (CA2 1999), and finan-\\ncial institution fraud (§1344), see, e.g., United States v.\\nFarr, 69 F. 3d 545 (CA9 1995).\\n   The plurality opinion suggests that the application of a\\nprofits interpretation will be easy in cases in which the\\nfinancial transactions are payments of “expenses.” Ante,\\nat 9.

On the other\\nhand, those who work in the operation may have the\\nexpectation of receiving a certain percentage of the gross\\nrevenue (perhaps even in addition to a salary), in which\\ncase their distribution may include profits. Such was the\\ncase in Santos’ lottery, where the runners were paid a\\npercentage of gross revenue. See Indictment 5; 16 Tr.\\n1399 (Oct. 9, 1997).\\n  The plurality opinion cites 18 U. S. C. §1963(a) and 21\\nU. S. C. §853(a), for the proposition that Congress has\\n“elsewhere” imposed the burden of proving that illegally\\nobtained funds represent profits, but the plurality opin-\\nion’s examples are inapposite. Ante, at 12. Neither of\\nthese provisions, however, requires a determination of net\\nincome. Both provisions permit a fine in the amount of\\n“not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.”\\n18 U. S. C. §1963(a). Thus, the term “proceeds” as used in\\nthese provisions is not limited to profits.8\\n   For all these reasons, I am convinced that the term\\n——————\\n   8 In 18 U. S. C. §981(a)(2)(B), which is a forfeiture provision of limited\\n\\nscope, Congress defines the term “proceeds” to mean net income.\\nHowever, that definition applies only “[i]n cases involving lawful goods\\nor lawful services that are sold or provided in an illegal manner.”\\nCalculating net income in that situation is easier than it would be in\\nmost money laundering cases, and it is noteworthy that Congress took\\ncare to provide rules and procedures to be used in making the calcula-\\ntion. See ibid. If Congress had intended to require proof of net income\\nin money laundering cases, it is likely that Congress likewise would\\nhave specified the rules and procedures to be used. It is noteworthy\\nthat subparagraph (A) of §981(a)(2), which the plurality opinion does\\nnot mention, provides that in cases that are more analogous to the\\ntypical money laundering case, i.e., “cases involving illegal goods [or]\\nillegal services,” the term “proceeds” “means [any] property of any kind\\nobtained directly or indirectly, as the result of the commission of the\\noffense giving rise to forfeiture, and any property traceable thereto, and\\nis not limited to the net gain or profit realized from the offense.”\\n\\x0c                 Cite as: 553 U.

And contrary to the approach\\ntaken by JUSTICE STEVENS, I do not see how the meaning\\nof the term “proceeds” can vary depending on the nature of\\nthe illegal activity that produced the laundered funds.\\n                             II \\n\\n                             A\\n\\n  It is apparent that a chief reason for interpreting the\\nterm “proceeds” to mean net income in all money launder-\\ning cases (the approach taken in the plurality opinion) or\\nin some money laundering cases (the approach taken by\\nJUSTICE STEVENS) is the desire to avoid a “merger” prob-\\nlem in gambling cases—that is, to avoid an interpretation\\nthat would mean that every violation of §1955 (conducting\\nan illegal gambling business) would also constitute a\\nviolation of the money laundering statute, which carries a\\nmuch higher maximum penalty (20 as opposed to 5 years’\\nimprisonment). This concern is misplaced and provides no\\njustification for hobbling a statute that applies to more\\nthan 250 predicate offenses and not just running an illegal\\ngambling business.\\n  First, the so-called merger problem is fundamentally a\\nsentencing problem, and the proper remedy is a sentenc-\\ning remedy. While it is true that the money laundering\\nstatute has a higher maximum sentence than the gam-\\nbling business statute, neither statute has a mandatory\\nminimum. Thus, these statutes do not require a judge to\\nincrease a defendant’s sentence simply because the defen-\\ndant was convicted of money laundering as well as run-\\nning a gambling business. When the respondents were\\nconvicted, their money laundering convictions resulted in\\nhigher sentences only because of the money laundering\\nSentencing Guideline, United States Sentencing Commis-\\nsion, Guidelines Manual §2S1.1 (Nov. 1997) (USSG),\\n\\x0c18                    UNITED STATES v. SANTOS\\n\\n                           ALITO, J., dissenting\\n\\nwhich, in the pre-Booker 9 era, was mandatory. I agree\\nwith JUSTICE BREYER, ante, at 2–3 (dissenting opinion),\\nthat if a defendant is convicted of money laundering for\\ndoing no more than is required for a violation of 18\\nU. S. C. §1955, the defendant’s sentence should be no\\nhigher than it would have been if the defendant had vio-\\nlated only that latter provision. Insofar as the Guidelines\\npreviously required—and now advise in favor of—a stiffer\\nsentence, the obvious remedy is an amendment of the\\nmoney laundering Guideline. And of course, now that the\\nGuidelines are no longer mandatory, a sentencing judge\\ncould impose the sentence called for by the Guideline that\\napplies to the gambling business provision, see USSG\\n§2E3.1(a)(1) (Nov. 2007), or an entirely different sentence.\\n   Second, the merger problem that the plurality opinion\\nand JUSTICE STEVENS seek to avoid assumes the correct-\\nness of the interpretation of the promotion prong of the\\nmoney laundering statute that the Seventh Circuit\\nadopted in Santos’ direct appeal, i.e., that a defendant\\n“promotes” an illegal gambling business by doing those\\nthings, such as paying employees and winning bettors,\\nthat are needed merely to keep the business running. As\\nSantos’ brief puts it, the merger problem arises when the\\ninterpretation of “proceeds” as gross receipts is\\n“[c]ombined with the Government’s broad application of\\nthe ‘promotion’ prong of the money laundering statute.”\\nBrief for Respondent 6. But the meaning of the element of\\npromotion is not before us in this case, and it would not\\nmake sense to allow our interpretation of “proceeds” to be\\ndictated by an unreviewed interpretation of another statu-\\ntory element.\\n   Third, even if there is a merger problem, it occurs in\\nonly a subset of money laundering cases.

The meaning of the term “pro-\\nceeds” cannot vary from one money laundering case to the\\nnext, and the plurality opinion and JUSTICE STEVENS\\ninappropriately allow the interpretation of that term to be\\ncontrolled by a problem that may arise in only a subset of\\ncases.\\n                             B\\n  The plurality opinion defends its interpretation by\\ninvoking the rule of lenity, but the rule of lenity does not\\nrequire us to put aside the usual tools of statutory inter-\\npretation or to adopt the narrowest possible dictionary\\ndefinition of the terms in a criminal statute.

      "[{'894 F.2d 909': '894 F.2d 909\\nUNITED STATES of America, Plaintiff-Appellee,v.David Thomas SCHIEMAN, Defendant-Appellant.\\nNo. 89-1782.\\nUnited States Court of Appeals,Seventh Circuit.\\nArgued Sept. 25, 1989.Decided Jan. 31, 1990.Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc Denied April 23, 1990.\\n\\nTimothy M. Morrison (argued), Office of the U.S. Atty., Indianapolis, Ind., for plaintiff-appellee.\\nAllan L. Yackey (argued), Rimstidt, Yackey & Ladd, Indianapolis, Ind., for defendant-appellant.\\nBefore BAUER, Chief Judge, RIPPLE, and MANION, Circuit Judges.\\nBAUER, Chief Judge.\\n\\n\\n1\\nA defendant who is convicted of a violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g) and has three previous convictions for a violent felony or serious drug offense or both, committed on occasions different from one another, is subject to the penalty enhancement provisions of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e).  Section 924(e) provides that such a person shall be imprisoned for not less than fifteen years.  The first issue on appeal is the appropriate standard by which to determine whether the defendant has three previous convictions.  The second issue is whether two of David Thomas Schieman\\'s previous felony offenses, a burglary and an aggravated battery which occurred on the same evening, meet this standard.  The district court determined that Schieman was subject to Sec. 924(e) sentencing.  We affirm.\\n\\nI.\\n\\n2\\nA federal grand jury sitting in the Southern District of Indiana returned a five count indictment against Schieman.  The indictment charged him with being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g)(1) and with being a fugitive in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(g)(2).  The indictment also charged him with assault on a federal officer in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 111, possession of an unregistered firearm in violation of 26 U.S.C. Sec. 5861(d), and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number in violation of 26 U.S.C. Sec. 5861(h).  A superseding indictment was filed later, adding a sixth count, solicitation of a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 373.  The government then notified the court and the defendant that it would seek to have Schieman sentenced pursuant to Sec. 924(e).\\n\\n\\n3\\nThereafter, Schieman and the government entered into a plea agreement.  Schieman agreed to plead guilty to counts 3 and 4, charging violations of 18 U.S.C. Secs. 922(g)(1) and (2), and counts 5 and 6, charging violations of 26 U.S.C. Secs. 5861(d) and (h).  The government agreed to dismiss the count charging solicitation of a crime of violence.  (The government had earlier asked the court to dismiss the count charging assault on a federal officer.)    The plea agreement also provided that the government would seek to have Schieman sentenced pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e).\\n\\n\\n4\\nAt the sentencing hearing, the government introduced evidence of four previous convictions in order to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 924(e).  The court found that a 1980 conviction for conspiracy to commit escape did not satisfy the \"violent felony\" requirement, but that a 1980 conviction for bank robbery did.  Neither of these determinations are at issue on appeal.  The government also introduced evidence of two other convictions for offenses which occurred on May 1, 1974.  At approximately 2:00 a.m. on May 1, Schieman broke into Jenny\\'s Cake Fair, located at 1518 S. Main St. in Bloomington, Illinois.  He stole money from the cash register and fled the scene.  Thereafter, he went to Hicksatomic Gas Station, located at 1201 S. Main St. and used the public telephone to call a taxicab.  While making the call, he was observed by Officer Ernest Sandell of the Bloomington Police Department who was investigating the burglary.  When Sandell approached to question him, Scheiman knocked Sandell to the ground and escaped on foot.  In the phone booth, Sandell found two brown paper sacks containing $30.50, including two rolls of pennies stamped Jenny\\'s Cake Fair.  Schieman was subsequently arrested, tried and found guilty of one count of burglary and one count of aggravated battery.  At the sentencing hearing, the government contended that these convictions were two separate convictions for violent felonies and that, together with the 1980 conviction for bank robbery, these convictions made Schieman subject to the penalty enhancement provision of Sec. 924(e).  The district court agreed and sentenced him to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons for a term of 15 years on counts 3 and 4, to be served concurrently with the term of 36 months on counts 5 and 6.  Schieman then brought this appeal.  He first argues that the predicate offenses must be the product of \"separate and distinct criminal episodes\" in order to count towards the three previous convictions required by Sec. 924(e).  He next contends that his convictions for burglary and aggravated battery were the product of just one criminal episode and thus that he was improperly sentenced under Sec. 924(e).\\n\\nII.\\n\\n5\\nIn order to be subject to the enhanced penalty provisions of ACCA, a defendant must have three previous convictions for any violent felony or serious drug offense committed on occasions different from one another.  18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e).1   The first issue on appeal is the appropriate standard by which to determine whether the defendant has the three requisite convictions.  There are two possibilities.2   Most courts have held that a defendant is subject to the enhanced penalty, regardless of the number of adjudications, as long as each conviction arises out of a separate and distinct criminal episode.  See, e.g., United States v. Pedigo, 879 F.2d 1315 (6th Cir.1989), United States v. Towne, 870 F.2d 880 (2nd Cir.1989), United States v. Herbert, 860 F.2d 620 (5th Cir.1988), United States v. Gillies, 851 F.2d 492 (1st Cir.1988), United States v. Rush, 840 F.2d 580 (8th Cir.1988), United States v. Wicks, 833 F.2d 192 (9th Cir.1987), United States v. Greene, 810 F.2d 999 (11th Cir.1986).  In adopting this standard, the First Circuit in Herbert stated:\\n\\n\\n6\\nThe Supreme Court in Petty, faced with a similar issue, concluded that multiple convictions must be treated as one conviction for Sec. 1202(a) purposes if the convictions arose from a single criminal transaction.  The negative implication of this holding is that multiple convictions arising from multiple criminal transactions should be treated as separate convictions, regardless of the number of judicial proceedings involved in the conviction.  To hold otherwise would be to create a situation in which the state, by electing to consolidate or not to consolidate charges based on separate transactions, could maneuver a defendant into or out-of the Armed Career Criminal status.\\n\\n\\n7\\nHerbert, 860 F.2d at 622.\\n\\n\\n8\\nThe Third Circuit, however, has held that each criminal episode must be adjudicated separately to count towards the three convictions required by the statute.  United States v. Balascsak, 873 F.2d 673 (3rd Cir.1989) (en banc).  In Balascsak, the district court sentenced the defendant according to Sec. 1202(a) based upon a finding that two burglaries committed one block apart on the night of July 10-11, 1981 (the first occurred at 10:45 p.m., and the second sometime between 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.) and adjudicated together counted as two convictions.  Six members of the en banc court held that the ACCA did not intend that such jointly tried offenses count toward the three predicate offenses.  Rather, the statute was aimed at\\n\\n\\n9\\n[Those] people who have demonstrated, by virtue of their definition, that locking them up and letting them go doesn\\'t do any good.  They go on again, you lock them up, you let them go, it doesn\\'t do any good, they are back for a third time.  At that juncture we should say, \\'That\\'s it;  time out;  it is all over.  We, as responsible people, will never give you the opportunity to do this again.\\'\\n\\n\\n10\\nId. at 682 (quoting Testimony of Stephen Trott, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, reprinted in Armed Career Criminal Act:  Hearing on H.R. 1627 and S. 52 Before the Subcomm. on Crime of the House Comm. on the Judiciary, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 6, 64 (1984)).  To the \"separate and distinct criminal episode\" test employed by the other circuits, the six judges of the panel thus grafted on the requirement that each criminal episode must be punctuated by its own adjudication in order to count as a separate conviction.\\n\\n\\n11\\nFive judges vigorously disagreed, however, with the majority\\'s assessment of the statute, and argued in dissent that \"Congress\\'s concern in enacting the enhanced penalty provision at issue in this case was with those criminals involved in repeated criminal episodes, with or without intervening efforts at rehabilitation.\"    Balascsak, 873 F.2d at 688.    The dissent cited the repeated statements in the legislative history that criminals are caught and convicted for fewer crimes than they actually commit, see, e.g., S.Rep. No. 585, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 3, 21, 72 (1982), S.Rep. No. 190, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 1, 5 (1983), which suggested that\\n\\n\\n12\\nCongress\\'s overriding concern with the fact that once a person has three previous convictions for the offenses specified in the Act, he or she is quite likely to be a member of that \\'small number of repeat offenders [who] commit a highly disproportionate amount of the violent crime plaguing America today,\\' S.Rep. No. 585 at 20, regardless of any intervening convictions.\\n\\n\\n13\\nBalascsak, 873 F.2d at 688.    The dissent thus advocated the adoption of the \"separate and distinct criminal episode\" test and would have sentenced Balascsak under Sec. 924(e).\\n\\n\\n14\\nPrior to this appeal, this circuit has not had the opportunity to address the appropriate standard under which to determine whether the defendant has three previous convictions for the purposes of Sec. 924(e).  We now adopt the reasoning of the dissent in Balascsak and the majority of other circuits which have faced this question.3   We think that this answer is clear after the most recent amendment to Sec. 924(e), which clarified any previous ambiguity in the statutory language.  See Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub.L. 100-690, Sec. 7056, 102 Stat. 4181, 4402 (1988).4   The statute now reads:\\n\\n\\n15\\nIn the case of a person who violates section 922(g) of this title and has three previous convictions by any court referred to in section 922(g)(1) of this title for a violent felony of a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another, such person shall be fined not more than $25,000 and imprisoned not less than 15 years ...\\n\\n\\n16\\n18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e) (1988) (emphasis added).  This is the same language used in two other penalty enhancement provisions, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3575(e)(1) (repealed effective Nov. 1, 1987) and 21 U.S.C. Sec. 849(e)(1) (repealed effective Nov. 1, 1987), neither of which required that the predicate offenses be adjudicated separately to count towards the three convictions required by the statute.  See Balascsak, 873 F.2d at 686 n. 2. Although it is unnecessary to look to the legislative history when the statutory language is unambiguous, we also agree with those circuits which have examined the legislative history and concluded that the ACCA was aimed at repeat offenders regardless of the number of intervening convictions.  See, e.g. Wicks, 833 F.2d at 194, Herbert, 860 F.2d at 622.\\n\\n\\n17\\nFor the reasons stated above, we follow the reasoning of the majority of circuits and adopt the \"separate and distinct criminal episode\" test to determine whether a defendant is subject to the enhanced penalty provision of Sec. 924(e).\\n\\nIII.\\n\\n18\\nSchieman contends that the district court erred by finding that the offenses of which he was convicted were the product of separate and distinct criminal episodes.  He argues that the offense of aggravated battery was simply a continuation of the burglary offense and therefore that these two offenses cannot be counted separately.  We disagree.\\n\\n\\n19\\nIn this case, Schieman had successfully completed the burglary of Jenny\\'s Cake Fair and safely escaped from the premises before committing the subsequent offense.  See United States v. Wicks, 833 F.2d 192 (two burglaries committed the same night in different locations counted as two predicate offenses for Sec. 924(e) sentencing).  He was three blocks away from the store when Officer Sandell approached him.  To consider the aggravated battery offense a continuation of the burglary offense would preclude from Sec. 924(e) consideration any offense which is designed to prevent detection of the original crime.  Had Officer Sandell questioned Schieman about this robbery the following day, or three weeks later, Schieman\\'s attack undoubtedly would be considered a separate and distinct episode.  Once the original crime is complete, there is no principled way to distinguish between an attack in response to an investigation commenced within ten minutes of the burglary and an attack in response to an investigation commenced a day after the burglary.  To make a distinction in this situation would grant the criminal an unintended windfall for the quick detection of his crime.  This we decline to do.\\n\\n\\n20\\nBecause Schieman \"committed separate crimes against separate victims in separate locations,\"  United States v. Towne, 870 F.2d at 891 (citing Wicks, 833 F.2d at 193;  Greene, 810 F.2d at 1000), we find that Schieman\\'s offenses of burglary and aggravated battery should count as two separate convictions for Sec. 924(e) sentencing purposes.  These two convictions, together with the 1980 conviction for bank robbery, make him subject to Sec. 924(e).  The decision of the district court is therefore affirmed.\\n\\n\\n21\\nRIPPLE, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\\n\\n\\n22\\nI agree with the majority\\'s conclusion that the \"separate and distinct criminal episode\" test is the appropriate analysis to determine the applicability of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e).  However, I respectfully disagree that this analysis, when applied to the facts of this case, justifies the enhancement of Mr. Schieman\\'s sentence.  My brothers conclude that Mr. Schieman is liable under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 924(e) because he was convicted of having committed two crimes on the same evening.  However, it is clear that the two incidents were in reality part of a single criminal episode:  Mr. Schieman committed a robbery, walked three blocks away to make a telephone call to arrange transportation away from the scene, and, in an attempt to evade apprehension, pushed a police officer at the phone booth.  The pushing incident occurred approximately five minutes after the robbery.\\n\\n\\n23\\nIn an attempt to justify its characterization of this event as two separate criminal episodes, the majority states that \"[o]nce the original crime is complete, there is no principled way to distinguish between an attack in response to an investigation commenced within ten minutes of the burglary and an attack in response to an investigation commenced a day after the burglary.\"    Ante at 913.  This rationale ought not stand for two reasons.  First, it is contrary to the express intent of Congress.  Secondly, the analytical methodology necessary to make such a \"principled\" distinction is well-established in our criminal law.\\n\\n\\n24\\n* The legislative intent with respect to this section is certainly no mystery.  Indeed, the executive branch, responsible for the enforcement of federal criminal statutes, has acknowledged the congressional mandate and, at least on a national level, attempted to remain faithful to it.  During the 1984 legislative hearings, then Assistant Attorney General Stephen S. Trott described the Armed Career Criminal Act as aimed at persons who, having already been involved in a serious criminal episode, return to such antisocial behavior:\\n\\n\\n25\\nThese are people who have demonstrated, by virtue of their definition, that locking them up and letting them go doesn\\'t do any good.  They go on again, you lock them up, you let them go, it doesn\\'t do any good, they are back for a third time.  At that juncture, we should say, \"That\\'s it;  time out;  it is all over.  We, as responsible people, will never give you the opportunity to do this again.\"\\n\\n\\n26\\nArmed Career Criminal Act, Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Crime of the House Comm. on the Judiciary, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 64 (1984) (quoted in Brief of Solicitor General at 8-9, Petty v. United States, 481 U.S. 1034, 107 S.Ct. 1968, 95 L.Ed.2d 810 (1987)).  In similar fashion, in a brief submitted to the Supreme Court in Petty v. United States, 481 U.S. 1034, 107 S.Ct. 1968, 95 L.Ed.2d 810 (1987), the Solicitor General examined the legislative history of the statute:\\n\\n\\n27\\n[R]eferences throughout the legislative reports and the floor debates to \"career criminals,\" \"repeat offenders,\" \"habitual offenders,\" \"recidivists,\" \"revolving door\" offenders, \"three time loser,\" \"third-time offender,\" \"[defendants] convicted three times,\" and to defendants committing a \"third or subsequent robbery,\" are inconsistent with the notion that Congress intended [the statute], unlike in other federal enhanced penalty provisions, to count previous convictions on multiple felony counts arising from a single criminal episode as multiple \"previous convictions.\"\\n\\n\\n28\\nId. at 7.\\n\\n\\n29\\nOur colleagues in other circuits have recognized this congressional mandate and have been scrupulous in observing the congressional limitations on the scope of this potent enhancement provision.  See, e.g., United States v. Pedigo, 879 F.2d 1315 (6th Cir.1989) (remanding for a determination as to whether the predicate convictions constituted requisite number of criminal episodes).  Even when dealing with situations that more clearly fall within the scope of the statute, they have carefully differentiated those situations from the type before us now.1   Certainly the two cases cited by the majority hardly support its conclusion that Mr. Schieman\\'s actions on the night of May 1, 1974 must be considered as separate episodes.  Indeed, in United States v. Towne, 870 F.2d 880 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 109 S.Ct. 2456, 104 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1989), the court determined that two incidents, which together resulted in four felony convictions of kidnapping and rape, constituted two prior episodes, not four.  Id. at 891.    After examining the legislative history of section 924(e), the court concluded:\\n\\n\\n30\\nIt seems quite clear that this section of the Act was intended to target recidivists, i.e., those who have engaged in violent criminal activity on at least three separate occasions, and not individuals who happen to acquire three convictions as a result of a single criminal episode (or, as here, two such criminal events).\\n\\n\\n31\\nId. at 891.    In the second case cited by the majority, United States v. Wicks, 833 F.2d 192 (9th Cir.1987), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 109 S.Ct. 87, 102 L.Ed.2d 63 (1988), the defendant had committed two burglaries on the same night.  However, the crimes were separate and distinct.  They occurred at different locations.  One was not the continuation of the other.  By contrast, here the crimes were committed as part of the same operation or episode--a burglary and the immediate escape.  The crimes do not meet the rigorous standard that should be met for determining separate criminal episodes.  See United States v. Balascsak, 873 F.2d 673, 684 (3d Cir.1989) (en banc) (\"I believe that the separate criminal episode requirement must be read rigorously and that we must insist that the government prove convincingly that the crimes (and the episodes of which they were part) were truly separate.\")    (Becker, J., concurring).\\n\\nB\\n\\n32\\nThe majority\\'s suggestion that no principled distinction is possible between a crime committed to elude detection within ten minutes of the original crime and one committed a day later ignores the fact that similar distinctions are made often in our criminal law.  For instance, the same type of determination is made in the case of felony-murder.  Under Indiana law, a homicide committed during the asportation of stolen property is considered to occur within one continuous transaction.  Eddy v. State, 496 N.E.2d 24, 28 (Ind.1986).  \"A transaction is continuous when the commission of both the homicide and felony are closely connected in time, place, and continuity of action.\"    Sheckles v. State, 501 N.E.2d 1053, 1056 (Ind.1986).  Certainly, ever since Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496 n. 14, 105 S.Ct. 3275, 3285 n. 14, 87 L.Ed.2d 346 (1985), \"[t]his circuit has followed the Supreme Court\\'s admonition and has required that the government prove \\'continuity plus relationship\\' in order to show a pattern [of racketeering activity] for purposes of RICO.\"    United States v. Muskovsky, 863 F.2d 1319, 1329 (7th Cir.1988), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 109 S.Ct. 1345, 103 L.Ed.2d 813 (1989).  See also United States v. Horak, 833 F.2d 1235, 1240 (7th Cir.1987).  There is no reason why the same sort of assessment cannot be made here.  The congressional intent is clear:  the enhancement is to apply to the person who turns anew to criminal activity after an earlier and completed episode.  The factual assessment necessary to implement that legislative intent is the traditional fare of the judicial process.  It is hardly an impossible task.\\n\\n\\n33\\nToday\\'s holding places this circuit well outside the mainstream of judicial interpretation on this issue.  This penalty enhancement provision is an important tool in the maintenance of a peaceful society.  There is no more certain way to weaken it than to stretch it beyond recognition.\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n The original ACCA appeared at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1202(a)(1) (Supp.1984).  Thus some of the decisions cited in this opinion will refer to Sec. 1202(a) rather than Sec. 924(e)\\n\\n\\n2\\n Prior to the 1988 amendment to the statute, which added the language \"committed on occasions different from one another,\" there was a third possibility, evidenced by the Eighth Circuit\\'s decision in United States v. Petty, 798 F.2d 1157 (8th Cir.1986), vacated, 481 U.S. 1034, 107 S.Ct. 1968, 95 L.Ed.2d 810 (1987), on remand, 828 F.2d 2 (1988).  In Petty, the court imposed the enhanced sentence upon a defendant who had previously been convicted of six counts of armed robbery arising from an incident in which the defendant simultaneously robbed six patrons of a restaurant.  In response to Petty\\'s petition for writ of certiorari, the Solicitor General confessed error, stating \"[W]e believe that the underlying purpose of the statute and the intent of Congress ... indicate that the court of appeals was in error in construing the statute to reach multiple felony convictions arising out of a single criminal episode.\"    (Brief at 29-30).  The Supreme Court granted Petty\\'s petition with respect to this issue and remanded to the court of appeals for reconsideration.  481 U.S. 1034, 107 S.Ct. 1968, 95 L.Ed.2d 810.    On remand, the court vacated the enhanced sentence and adopted the view of the Solicitor General that the \"statute was intended to reach multiple criminal episodes that were distinct in time.\"    Petty, 828 F.2d at 3\\n\\n\\n3\\n It appears that the viability of the plurality opinion in Balascsak is in question after the Third Circuit\\'s most recent decision on this issue.  In United States v. Schoolcraft, 879 F.2d 64 (3rd Cir.1989), a per curiam court adopted the \"separate and distinct criminal episode\" test of the dissent in Balascsak.    (Judge Scirica, however, dissented from the decision.)    The Schoolcraft court found that it was not bound by the decision in Balascsak because of the alignment of votes.  Six members of the court required intervening convictions in order to apply the ACCA.  A seventh concurred in the result:  he adopted the dissent\\'s \"separate and distinct\" test, but found it was not met in this case.  The remaining five judges adopted the \"separate and distinct\" test and found that it was satisfied by the facts of the offenses.  After noting that it was not bound by the plurality opinion, the Schoolcraft court adopted the dissent\\'s analysis in Balascsak\\n\\n\\n4\\n Some circuits had found the original statutory language ambiguous and had looked to the legislative history for clarification.  See, e.g., United States v. Herbert, 860 F.2d at 622\\n\\n\\n1\\n See United States v. Taylor, 882 F.2d 1018, 1028-29 (6th Cir.1989) (determining whether acts constitute a single \"crime spree\" is a difficult question;  not presented in that case, since burglaries committed in different months);  United States v. Herbert, 860 F.2d 620, 622 n. 1 (5th Cir.1988) (not addressing issue of \"whether multiple convictions for crimes committed over a period of days or hours as part of a criminal spree constitute single or multiple criminal transactions\"), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 109 S.Ct. 2074, 104 L.Ed.2d 639 (1989);  United States v. Gillies, 851 F.2d 492, 497 (1st Cir.)  (sufficient predicate convictions even if two burglaries on same night treated as single episode), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 109 S.Ct. 147, 102 L.Ed.2d 119 (1988)\\n\\n\\n'}]\n",

      "[{'I. THE RULE OF LENITY SHOULD BE APPLIED RIGOROUSLY TO MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCING STATUTES': '\"[T]he rule of lenity[] teach[es] that ambiguities \\nabout the breadth of a cri minal statute should be \\nresolved in the defendant\\'s favor.\"  United States v. \\nDavis , 139 S. Ct. 2319, 2333 ( 2019).  That rule has \\nfamously been described as \"\\'perhaps not much less old than\\' the task of statut ory \\'construction itself.\\'\"  \\nId. (quoting United States v. Wiltberger , 18 U.S.  \\n(5 Wheat.) 76, 95 (1820) (Marshall, C.J.)).   \\nAt its core the rule of le nity is an understanding \\nthat \"a fair warning should be given to the world in \\nlanguage that the common world will understand,  \\nof what the law intends to  do if a certain line is \\npassed,\" and that, \"[t]o make  the warning fair, so far \\nas possible the line sh ould be clear.\"  McBoyle v. \\nUnited States , 283 U.S. 25, 27 (1931) (Holmes, J.).  In \\naddition, judicial adherence to the rule of lenity also \"places the weight of inertia upon the party\" – that \\nis, the executive branch – \"that can best induce \\nCongress to speak more clearly and keeps courts \\n 7 \\nfrom making criminal law in Congress\\'s stead.\"  \\nUnited States v. Santos , 553 U.S. 507, 514 (2008) \\n(plurality); see Bell v. United States , 349 U.S. 81, 83 \\n(1955) (Frankfurter, J.) (\" When Congress leaves to \\nthe Judiciary the task of imputing to Congress an \\nundeclared will, the ambiguity should be resolved in \\nfavor of lenity.\"). \\nIn several cases involving mandatory minimum \\nsentencing provisions, the Court has recognized and \\napplied the \"presupposition . . . [that] doubts in the enforcement of a penal code\" should be \"resolve[d] . . . \\nagainst the imposition of a harsher punishment.\"  Bell, 349 U.S. at 83.  Examples include Davis , which \\ninvoked lenity to reject a broader saving construction of a different provision of the same mandatory mini-\\nmum statute at issue here, see 139 S. Ct. at 2333; \\nBurrage v. United States , 571 U.S. 204 (2014), which \\ndescribed a 15-year mandat ory minimum statute as \\n\"a criminal statute subject to the rule of lenity,\" and \\nlenity as a reason the Court \"[e]specially\" could not \\ndepart from the \"ordinary,  accepted meaning\" of  \\n\"the [statutory] text,\" id. at 216; and United States  \\nv. Granderson , 511 U.S. 39 (1994), which \"appl[ied] \\nthe rule of lenity\" to \"resolve [an] ambiguity\" in a \"mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment\" \\nafter revocation of probation, id. at 56-57.  Those \\ndecisions cohere with others explaining that the rule of lenity assists \"not only to resolve issues about the \\nsubstantive scope of criminal statutes, but to answer questions about the severity of sentencing.\"  United \\nStates v. R.L.C. , 503 U.S. 291, 306 (1992) (plurality) \\n(citing Bifulco v. United States , 447 U.S. 381, 387 \\n(1980) (collecting cases)). \\nIndeed, especially good reasons warrant applying \\nthe rule of lenity rigorously to statutes that, like the \\nACCA, create aggravated offenses with mandatory \\n 8 \\nminimum sentences.  A broad construction bars \\njudges from tailoring the sentence to the offense and \\nthe offender, leading to particularly harsh conse-\\nquences that only Congress can correct.  A narrower \\nconstruction, by contrast, does not prevent judges \\nfrom imposing longer sentences where necessary.  \\n\"These interpretive asymmetries give the rule of \\nlenity special force in the context of mandatory \\nminimum provisions.\"  Dean v. United States , 556 \\nU.S. 568, 585 (2009) (Breyer, J., dissenting). \\nFurther, experience shows that mandatory mini-\\nmum statutes frequently present difficult problems \\nof statutory construction, creating a heightened risk \\nthat courts will read them to impose sentences that \\nCongress never intended.  Wh ere, as here, an unclear \\nstatute presents a palpable risk of error, courts \\nproperly refuse to \"condemn a man to a minimum of \\n15 years in prison on the basis of . . . speculation,\" \\nBegay v. United States , 553 U.S. 137, 154 (2008) \\n(Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment), about what \\nCongress meant to say.'}, {'A. The Rule of Lenity Helps Avoid the Particularly High Costs of Reading Mandatory Minimums Too Broadly': '1. The costs of erroneously construing mandatory \\nminimum sentencing provisions too broadly are especially high, and the costs of construing them too \\nnarrowly are especially low.  The greatest cost of \\nreading a mandatory minimu m too broadly is that \\nindividual defendants lose  their liberty.  Mandatory \\nminimum provisions are, by design, severe.  They \\noften tie an additional prison sentence of years or \\ndecades (here, a decade and a half) to a single factual \\ndetermination.  Such provisions therefore speak to \\nthe core concern that has motivated courts to apply \\nthe rule of lenity for centuries:  the \"instinctive \\n 9 \\ndistaste[] against men lang uishing in prison unless \\nthe lawmaker has clearly sa id they should.\"  Henry \\nJ. Friendly, \"Mr. Justice Frankfurter and the Reading of Statutes,\" in Benchmarks  196, 209 (1967), \\nquoted in United States v. Bass , 404 U.S. 336, 348 \\n(1971).  Because of that concern, this Court \"will not \\ninterpret a federal criminal statute so as to increase \\nthe penalty that it places on an individual when such \\nan interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what Congress intended.\"  Ladner v. \\nUnited States , 358 U.S. 169, 178 (1958). \\nFurther, mandatory minimum provisions often are \\nsaid to reflect (at least in theory) the moral judgment \\nof the community that particular conduct deserves \\nharsher punishment.  In our system of government, \\nthat judgment is reserved to the legislature.  The \\nrule of lenity ensures that criminal sentences \\nactually reflect legislative judgment, rather than \\nguesswork by the courts abo ut what the legislature \\nmeant.  See Granderson , 511 U.S. at 69 (Kennedy, J., \\nconcurring in the judgment) (\"\\'[B]ecause criminal punishment usually represents the moral condemna-\\ntion of the community, legislatures and not courts \\nshould define criminal activity,\\' and set the punish-\\nments therefor.\") (quoting Bass , 404 U.S. at 348) \\n(citation omitted); R.L.C. , 503 U.S. at 309 (Scalia, J., \\nconcurring in part and co ncurring in the judgment) \\n(describing one of \"the rule of lenity\\'s . . . purpose[s]\" \\nas \"assuring that the society, through its represen-\\ntatives, has genuinely called for the punishment to \\nbe meted out\"); Wiltberger , 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) at 95 \\n(explaining that \"[t]he rule that penal laws are to  be construed strictly\" is  founded not merely on \\n\"tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals\" \\nbut also on the \"plain principle that the power of \\n 10 \\npunishment is vested in the legislative, not in the \\njudicial department\"). \\nAny criminal statute presents these concerns,  \\nbut mandatory minimum provisions make them \\nparticularly weighty.  Unlike other criminal laws, \\nmandatory minimums are exceptions to the principle \\nthat courts should \"impose a sentence sufficient,  \\nbut not greater than necessary,\" to accomplish the goals of criminal punishme nt after considering  \\n\"the nature and circumstances of the offense and  \\nthe history and characteristics of the defendant.\"   \\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1).  A mandatory minimum is a \\ncongressional directive to subordinate justice in \\nindividual cases to a perceived need for greater \\ndeterrence or incapacitation generally.  Congress may choose to make that tradeoff (within constitu-\\ntional bounds), but the courts should ensure that \\nCongress has actually made that choice before \\nimposing needlessly harsh punishments.  Cf. Busic  \\nv. United States , 446 U.S. 398, 408-09 (1980) \\n(interpreting a sentencing enhancement; rejecting the \"assumption that . . . Congress\\' sole objective  \\nwas to increase the penalties . . . to the maximum \\nextent possible\"). \\n2. The adverse consequences of erroneously \\nexpanding mandatory sentencing beyond the limits of congressional intent affect more than just \\nindividual defendants.  Such errors strike at the \\nfoundations of the sentencing system by under-\\nmining \"sentencing proportionality – a key element of sentencing fairness.\"  Harris v. United States , 536 \\nU.S. 545, 570-71 (2002) (Breye r, J., concurring in \\npart and concurring in the judgment), overruled by \\nAlleyne v. United States , 570 U.S. 99 (2013).  As the \\nSentencing Commission – quoted with approval by this Court – has explained:  \"\\'The \"cliffs\" that result \\n 11 \\nfrom mandatory minimums compromise proportion-\\nality, a fundamental prem ise for just punishment, \\nand a primary goal of the Sentencing Reform Act.\\'\"  Neal v. United States , 516 U.S. 284, 291-92 (1996) \\n(quoting United States Sentencing Comm\\'n, Special \\nReport to the Congress:  Mandatory Minimum \\nPenalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System  iii \\n(Aug. 1991)). \\nFurther, the rule of leni ty historically has been \\njustified in part based on the \"principle of legality\":  conduct can be criminalized , and penalties author-\\nized, only by legislative action, so \"that the amount  \\nof discretion entrusted to those who enforce the law \\ndoes not exceed tolerable lim its.\"  Herbert L. Packer, \\nThe Limits of the Criminal Sanction  93 (1968).  As \\nthe Court put it in Marinello v. United States , 138 S. \\nCt. 1101 (2018), \"prosecutorial discretion\" to enforce \\na statute with \"wide-rangin g scope . . . places great \\npower in the hands of the prosecutor,\" creating risks of \"nonuniform execution\" and \"arbitary prosecution.\"  \\nId. at 1108-09.  That concern is one reason for  \\nthe Court\\'s \"\\'traditional[] exercise[]\\'\" of \"\\'restraint in \\nassessing the reach of a federal criminal statute.\\'\"  Id. at 1109 (quoting United States v. Aguilar , 515 \\nU.S. 593, 600 (1995)).  And it is a special problem \\nwith mandatory minimums that effectively transfer \\nsentencing discretion from the trial judge, \"the one \\nactor in the system most ex perienced with exercising \\ndiscretion,\" to \"an assistant prosecutor not trained in \\nthe exercise of discretion.\"   An Address by Anthony \\nM. Kennedy, Associate Justic e, Supreme Court of the \\nUnited States, Speech at the American Bar Associ-\\nation Annual Meeting (Aug. 9, 2003), available at  \\nhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/speeches/sp_08-09-03.html. \\n 12 \\nInconsistently exercised discretion means that, in \\npractice, mandatory minimums fail to yield even \\nuniformity in sentencing – the benefit they are \\nsupposed to obtain at the cost of individual justice \\nand proportionality.  Over decades, the Sentencing \\nCommission has repeatedly reported \"inconsisten[cy]\" \\nand \"wide geographic variations\" in the use of mandatory minimum sentences.  E.g., United States \\nSentencing Comm\\'n, Application and Impact of  \\n21 U.S.C. § 851:  Enhanced  Penalties for Federal \\nDrug Trafficking Offenders  6 (July 2018) (finding \\n\"significant variation in the extent to which . . . enhanced penalties were sought against eligible \\noffenders\"); see also United States v. Angelos , 345  \\nF. Supp. 2d 1227, 1252 (D. Utah 2004) (discussing \\n\"the potential for tremendous sentencing disparity if \\nfederal prosecutors across th e country do not uniformly \\ncharge . . . violations\" of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)), aff\\'d , 433 \\nF.3d 738 (10th Cir. 2006).\\n2   \\n                                                 \\n2 See also  United States Sentencing Comm\\'n, Mandatory \\nMinimum Penalties for Sex Offenses in the Federal Criminal \\nJustice System  56 (Jan. 2019) (finding that, \"[i]n fiscal year \\n2016, the mandatory minimum penalty for receipt [of child por-nography] [wa]s inconsistently applied,\" leading to \"substantial\" \\ndifferences in sentences where \"the conduct involved in the  \\noffenses was not meaningfully distinguishable\"); United States Sentencing Comm\\'n, Report to Congress:  Mandatory Minimum \\nPenalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System  345 (Oct. \\n2011) (\"2011 Report\") (finding \"inconsistencies in application  \\nof certain mandatory minimum penalties, as shown by . . .  \\ndata analyses and confirmed by interviews of prosecutors and \\ndefense attorneys\"); United States Sentencing Comm\\'n, Fifteen \\nYears of Guidelines Sentencing:  An Assessment of How Well  \\nthe Federal Criminal Justice System is Achieving the Goals  of Sentencing Reform  89 (Nov. 2004) (\"Research over the past \\nfifteen years has consistently found that mandatory penalty \\nstatutes are used inconsistently in cases in which they appear \\nto apply.\"). \\n 13 \\nIndeed, over the last two decades, different \\nAttorneys General have instructed federal prose-\\ncutors differently on how to use mandatory minimum \\nstatutes, switching between more- and less-aggressive \\napproaches.3  In adopting such policies, the executive \\nbranch takes into its own hands the tradeoff between \\nsentencing uniformity, on the one hand, and \\nindividual justice and proportionality, on the other.  Whatever the wisdom of the competing approaches, \\nthat practice emphasizes how mandatory minimum \\nstatutes transfer power over  individual liberty from \\nlawmakers and judges to pr osecutors.  In our adver-\\nsarial system, moreover, pr osecutors can and do use \\nthat power strategically in ways that undermine \\nstructural protections for individual liberties, such as by using the threat of a mandatory minimum to \\nobtain a guilty plea.  See United States v. Kupa ,  \\n976 F. Supp. 2d 417, 420 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) \\n(condemning the practice of \"coerc[ing] guilty pleas, \\nand sometimes . . . coerc[ing] cooperation as well,  \\n[by] routinely threaten[ing] ultra-harsh, enhanced mandatory sentences that no one  – not even the \\nprosecutors themselves – thinks are appropriate\") \\n(footnote omitted),  aff \\'d, 616 F. App\\'x 33  (2d Cir. 2015) . \\n                                                 \\n3 See Angelos , 345 F. Supp. 2d at 1253 & n.120 (discussing a \\n2003 memorandum intended \"to reduce charging disparities \\nstemming from § 924(c)\"); United States Sentencing Comm\\'n, \\nAn Overview of Mandatory Minim um Penalties in the Federal \\nCriminal Justice System 24-25 (July 2017) (comparing the 2013 \\n\"Smart on Crime\" initiative, which outlined circumstances  \\nin which prosecutors should \"\\'decline to charge\\'\" mandatory \\nminimum sentences, to \"revised guidance\" in 2017 directing \\nprosecutors generally to \"\\'charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense,\\'\" with seriousness measured by the \\ngreatest sentence, \" \\'including mandatory minimum sentences\\' \"). \\n 14 \\nNor does the expansion of prosecutorial power \\nthrough mandatory minimum statutes stop at the \\ncharging stage.  Even after conviction, the prosecutor \\nholds an important key to lessening the effect of a \\nmandatory minimum sentence.  A district court is \\nfreed from restrictions on its sentencing discretion \\n\"[u]pon motion of the Government . . . so as to reflect \\na defendant\\'s substantial assistance in the investi-gation or prosecution of another person,\" 18 U.S.C. \\n§ 3553(e), or it can similarly reduce the sentence \\nlater, again with the government\\'s approval, under \\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b)(4).\\n4  Suc h \\ndiscretionary motions have large effects on \\nsentences, often reducing them by many years.5  \\nResearch has found \"enorm ous differences in how \\nprosecutors exercise that di scretion, with substantial \\nvariation by district.\"6  Again, within broad constitu-\\ntional bounds, Congress has the power to create such \\na system.  But the Court need not and should not \\nbroaden more than Congress\\'s language requires \\n                                                 \\n4 In certain cases involving no n-violent drug offenders, a  \\ndistrict judge may invoke 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f), often called a  \\njudicial \"safety valve,\" but the sa fety valve is \"narrow\" and still \\nrequires prosecutorial approval in substance if not in form.   \\nRachel E. Barkow, Categorical Mistakes:  The Flawed Frame-\\nwork of the Armed Career Criminal Act and Mandatory Mini-\\nmum Sentencing , 133 Harv. L. Rev. 200, 218 (2019). \\n5 See United States Sentencing Comm\\'n,  Mandatory Minimum \\nPenalties for Firearms Offenses in the Federal Criminal Justice \\nSystem 42 (Mar. 2018)  (\"In fiscal year 2016, the average sentence \\nfor offenders who remained subject to the mandatory minimum \\npenalty [under § 924(e)] at sentencing was 200 months, signifi-cantly longer than the average sentence for offenders relieved of \\nthis mandatory minimum penalty (112 months).\"). \\n6 Barkow, Categorical Mistakes , 133 Harv. L. Rev. at  224 & \\nn.183, 236 & n.281 (discussing the 2011 and 1991 Reports). \\n 15 \\nstatutes that give prosecutors powers over individual \\nlives traditionally reserved  for independent judges. \\n3. By contrast, the costs of erroneously \\nconstruing a mandatory minimum provision too \\nnarrowly are relatively low, both for individual cases \\nand for the criminal justice system as a whole.  In \\ncases that fall outside the scope of a mandatory \\nminimum, but that nevertheless feature aggravating \\ncircumstances similar to those that moved Congress \\nto impose the minimum, a sentencing judge still has discretion (guided by § 3553(a) and the sentencing \\nguidelines) to impose a more severe sentence.  As Justice Breyer explained in Dean , \"an interpretive \\nerror on the side of leniency[] still permits  the \\nsentencing judge to impose a sentence similar to, \\nperhaps close to, the statutor y sentence even if that \\nsentence . . . is not legislatively required .\"  556 U.S. \\nat 584 (Breyer, J., dissenting). \\nMoreover, \"an error that excludes (erroneously) a \\nset of instances Congress me ant to include . . . could \\nlead the Sentencing Commission to focus on those cases . . . [and] make avail able to Congress a body of \\nevidence and analysis that w ill help it reconsider the \\nstatute.\"  Id. at 585.  Those who bring actions under \\nthe criminal laws (the executive branch) have far greater access to thos e who create them (the \\nlegislative branch) than do those who defend against \\nsuch actions (potential criminal defendants).  In light \\nof this practical reality, the rule of lenity \"places the \\nweight of inertia upon the party that can best induce \\nCongress to speak more clearly.\"  Santos , 553 U.S. at \\n514 (plurality).  \\n 16'}, {'B. The Risk of Reading Mandatory Minimums Too Broadly Is Also Particularly High': 'The risk of mistaking congressional intent is also \\nunusually high in the case of mandatory minimum \\nprovisions.  Those provisions often do not originate \\nfrom a careful and considered drafting process.   \\nThe history of the \"occasions different from one \\nanother\" language of § 924(e) (1) is a good example:  \\nas petitioner shows in detail, that language stemmed \\nfrom then-Solicitor-General  Fried\\'s confession of \\nerror to this Court in Petty v. United States , 481 U.S. \\n1034 (1987) (No. 86-6263).  In that case, the United States candidly admitted that the different-occasions \\nlanguage, present in \"other enhanced penalty \\nprovisions,\" was omitted from the predecessor to \\n§ 924(e)(1), even though the legislative history \\nshowed \"that both Congress and those supporting the legislation, including the Department of Justice, did \\nnot intend that the penalty provision would apply \\nmore broadly than in the case of the other federal \\nenhanced penalty statutes.\"   Pet. Br. App. 25a-26a; \\nsee id.  at 26a-31a. \\nHad the United States not taken the unusual step \\nof confessing error in Petty , the courts might well \\nhave concluded – as the Eighth Circuit already had –that Congress had intentionally left the different-occasions language out of th e statute.  After all,  \\nas the Solicitor General\\'s brief pointed out, courts \\nconstruing statutes often draw a \"negative implica-\\ntion\" from the omission of  language in one statute \\nthat is present in anot her, similar statute.  Id. at  \\n26a (citing Rodriguez v. United States , 480 U.S. 522, \\n525 (1987) (per curiam)).  An d courts reaching that \\nconclusion would have imposed minimum 15-year \\nsentences, not based on a \"genuine[] call[] for th[at] \\n 17 \\npunishment\" by \"society[\\'s] . . . representatives,\" R.L.C. , \\n503 U.S. at 309 (Scalia, J., concurrring in part and concurring in the judgment), but based on a slip of the legislative pen. \\nThere are other examples.  Indeed, § 924(e) \\npresents one:  its \"residual clause\" defined a \"violent \\nfelony\" to include any felony that \"involves conduct \\nthat presents a serious potential risk of physical \\ninjury.\"  18 U.S.C. § 924( e)(2)(B)(ii).  This Court \\nstruck that clause down as unconstitutionally vague \\nin Johnson v. United States , 576 U.S. 591 (2015), \\nrelying in part on \"[n]ine years\\' experience trying to derive meaning from the residual clause\" as evidence \\nthat the courts had \"embarked upon a failed enterprise.\"  Id. at 601-02.  And the Court reached \\nthe same conclusion in Davis as to § 924(e)\\'s cousin \\n§ 924(c), striking down a similarly vague clause that \\ntriggered mandatory minimum sentences of 5, 7, 10, and 25 years.  See 139 S. Ct. at 2325, 2336. \\nIn United States v. O\\'Brien , 560 U.S. 218 (2010), \\nthe Court described as \" unclear\" yet another provi-\\nsion of § 924(c) that i mposed a 30-year mandatory \\nminimum sentence for possessing a machinegun \\nwhile committing certain crimes.  Id. at 227, 229.  \\nFacing that lack of clarity, the Court applied a  five-factor test to determine whether machinegun \\npossession was intended to be an offense element  or as a sentencing factor.  See id. at 227-32.  In \\nGranderson , the Court diplomatically observed that \\n18 U.S.C. § 3565(a), imposi ng a mandatory minimum \\nsentence for certain revocations of parole, did not \\n\"appear[] . . . to have received Congress\\' careful \\nattention.\"  511 U.S. at 42.  Justice Scalia less \\ndiplomatically called § 3565(a) \"wretchedly drafted.\"  \\nId. at 60 (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment). \\n 18 \\nThe Court\\'s repeated struggles with opaque text \\nand structure in mandatory minimum provisions  \\nare the kind of \"experience\"  that is \"the life of the \\nlaw.\"  Johnson , 576 U.S. at 601.  That experience \\nteaches that mandatory minimum sentencing statutes, including the one at issue here, commonly \\nuse \"sweeping and imprecise language\" that \"set[s] \\nup a host of vexing constitutional and statutory \\ninterpretation questions for the courts.\"  Barkow, \\nCategorical Mistakes , 133 Harv. L. Rev. at 202.   \\nThe rule of lenity, \"as a so rt of \\'junior version of  \\nthe vagueness doctrine,\\'\" United States v. Lanier , \\n520 U.S. 259, 266 (1997) (quoting Packer, Criminal \\nSanction  at 95), is a useful doctrinal approach to \\nanswering those questions.  If the Court finds the \\nstatute now before it ambiguous, lenity can help – \\nand an emphasis on lenity in the context of \\nmandatory minimum statutes can help guide the \\nlower courts to solve futu re, similar problems that \\nwill inevitably arrive.\\n7 \\n                                                 \\n7 Some have stated that \"a court must find not just ambiguity \\nbut \\'grievous ambiguity\\' before resorting to the rule of lenity.\"  \\nShular v. United States , 140 S. Ct. 779, 788 & n.2 (2020)  \\n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (collecting examples).  Other recent decisions, drawing on a long line of authority, have applied \\nprinciples of lenity without the adjective \"grievous.\"  See, e.g., \\nDavis , 139 S. Ct. at 2333 (invoking lenity where \"a criminal \\nstatute . . . d[id] not clearly proscribe\" conduct and stating that \\n\"ambiguities about the breadth of a criminal statute should  be resolved in the defendant\\'s favor\").  The notion that lenity \\napplies only in cases of \"grievous ambiguity\" appeared in this \\nCourt\\'s cases relatively recently.  See Chapman v. United \\nStates , 500 U.S. 453, 463 (1991) (quoting Huddleston v. United \\nStates , 415 U.S. 814, 831 (1974), which had stated that the \\nCourt \"perceive[d] no grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in\" a \\nstatute before it, id., but did not suggest that \"grievous ambigu-\\nity\" was a threshold requirement for any reliance on lenity).  \\nThe rule of lenity itself goes back for centuries.  In any event, \\n 19'}, {'II. JUDICIAL EXPERIENCE WITH 18 U.S.C. section 924(e)(1) SUPPORTS APPLYING THE RULE OF LENITY': 'Petitioner\\'s brief ably sets forth why the Sixth \\nCircuit\\'s analysis finds no support in the ACCA\\'s \\ntext, history, or purpose.  FAMM agrees that this \\nCourt can and should reverse the judgment of the \\nSixth Circuit without resort to the rule of lenity or the principles that underlie it.  If the Court finds the \\nquestion close, however, it may help to consider \\njudicial experience applying the same standard that \\nthe Sixth Circuit applied here.  Examining that \\nexperience counsels in favor of lenity. \\nThat experience shows that the approach of the \\ncourt of appeals – asking wh ether \"it [is] possible to \\ndiscern the point at which the first offense is \\ncompleted and the subsequent point at which the \\nsecond offense begins,\" JA22 – does not satisfy this \\nCourt\\'s teaching that \"so far as possible the line should be clear.\"  McBoyle , 283 U.S. at 27.  Nor does \\nthat test align, in any way \"the common world will \\nunderstand,\" id., with Congress\\'s effo rt to classify as \\nan armed career criminal someone who has \"three previous convictions . . . for a violent felony or a \\nserious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions \\ndifferent from one another, \" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1).  \\nInstead, the temporal-sequencing test is at best \"no \\nmore than a guess as to what Congress intended,\" \\nLadner , 358 U.S. at 178 – a guess that produces \\narbitrary and unpredictable results. \\n                                                                                                   \\nwhere all the tools of statutory construction fail to resolve genu-\\nine ambiguity as to whether Congress has demanded a manda-\\ntory prison term, that ambiguity can fairly be called \"grievous.\" \\n 20'}, {'A. Entries of Separate Structures on a Single Day or Night Are Not Clearly Multiple Different \"Occasions\"': '1. The decision under review  is a useful starting \\npoint.  According to the Sixth Circuit, all 10 of Wooden\\'s 1997 convictions for burglary, which took \\nplace on a single night, were \"separate ACCA \\npredicate offenses\" that occurred on \"\\'occasions \\ndifferent from one another.\\'\"  JA21 (quoting 18 \\nU.S.C. § 924(e)(1)).  To support that conclusion, the court of appeals reasoned that, \"[w]hatever the \\ncontours of a \\'mini\\' wareho use, Wooden could not be \\nin two (let alone ten) of them  at once\"; that he \"could \\nhave ceased his criminal conduct\" after entering the \\nfirst warehouse without en tering nine more; and \\nthat, although \"one could characterize th[e] cluster of \\nwarehouses as being adjoined \\'at the same business location,\\'\" they were \"different locations\" because  \\ntheir owners had \"distinct se ts of property rights.\"  \\nJA23-24. \\nWooden argues persuasively (at 30) that the \\n\"textual foundations\" for the court of appeals\\' \"test \\n. . . are essentially nonexistent.\"  Even if the statute \\ndoes not wholly foreclose th at test, it certainly gives \\nno fair warning that unlawfully entering 10 small \\nwarehouses within the same building on a single \\nevening triggers a harsh 15-year penalty for later \\nowning a gun, while spending the same amount  \\nof time in a single warehouse would not.  The court  \\nof appeals\\' analysis thus  \"mak[es] criminal law  \\nin Congress\\'s stead.\"  Santos , 553 U.S. at 514 \\n(plurality).  At best it is judicial doctrine built up  \\nto cover the lack of clarity in the statute, rather  \\nthan anything that can claim to be an application of \\nthe statute itself.  Those who agree with Justice \\nScalia that \"it is not consistent with the rule of lenity \\n 21 \\nto construe a textually ambiguous penal statute \\nagainst a criminal defendant on the basis of legis-\\nlative history,\" R.L.C. , 503 U.S. at 307 (Scalia, J., \\nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment), \\ncan stop there, because the statute is at least \\ntextually ambiguous.   \\nThose who look to legislative history as an \\ninterpretive guide should reach the same ultimate \\nconclusion.  As Wooden persuasively shows (at 21-\\n25), that history ranges fr om an Assistant Attorney \\nGeneral\\'s 1984 testimony that the statute was meant \\nto catch \"people who have demonstrated . . . that \\nlocking them up and letting them go doesn\\'t do any \\ngood,\" Pet. Br. Add. 29a; to the Solicitor General\\'s 1987 concession in Petty that the statute was \\n\"intended\" to cover \"multiple criminal episodes,\" id. \\nat 26a; to then-Senator Biden\\'s 1988 statement that \\nthe statute was meant to \"express[] [a] concept of \\nwhat is meant by a \\'career criminal,\\'\" 134 Cong. Rec. S17,370 (daily ed. Nov. 10, 1988).  None of this \\nsuggests an intent – let alone a clear one – to \\nconsider multiple offenses on a single night to be a \\ncareer in crime because it took a few seconds to move \\nfrom one mini-warehouse to another within a cluster \\nof such warehouses. \\n2. The Fourth Circuit\\'s decision in United States \\nv. Carr , 592 F.3d 636 (4th Cir. 2010), illustrates the \\nsame point.  That case involved Daryl Carr, who possessed a firearm after previously pleading guilty \\nto 13 state-law charges of \"felony breaking or entering.\"  Id. at 638.  Those 13 offenses all took \\nplace on a single day in 2006 during which Carr broke into each of 13 \"different storage unit[s]\" at  \\nthe same street addres s (\"N.C. 32 South\").  Id.  The \\ncourt of appeals conceded that the offenses were \\n\"substantively the same and arguably had the same \\n 22 \\ncriminal objective,\" but it nevertheless found them  \\nto be \"separate and distinct criminal episodes.\"  Id.  \\nat 645.  It reasoned that  the storage units were \\n\"different locations\"; that mo st, though not all, of the \\noffenses had \"different victims\"; and that Carr \"had \\nthe opportunity . . . to cease and desist his criminal \\nbehavior\" between one storage unit and the next, \\nadding in a footnote that \"Carr simply could not have \\nbroken into or entered the 13 separate storage units simultaneously.\"  Id. at 645 & n.8 (citation omitted).\\n8 \\nIn that analysis, the Fourth Circuit asserted that \\nthe statutory \"\\'definition may be clear\\'\" but conceded \\nthat \"\\'the factual permutations surrounding the \\nACCA tend to create havoc\\'\"; that \"\\'courts have \\napplied a multiplicity of factors\\'\" in cases involving \\n§ 924(e); and that the \"analysis\" has a \"fluid nature.\"  Id. at 640 (quoting United States v. Letterlough ,  \\n63 F.3d 332, 335 (4th Cir.  1995)).  That sort of \\nassessment ought to be a warning sign in construing a criminal statute:  it calls to mind this Court\\'s \\nobservation in Johnson that \"pervasive disagreement \\nabout the nature of the inquiry one is supposed to \\nconduct and the kinds of factors one is supposed to \\nconsider\" is a sign of unacceptable vagueness.  576 \\nU.S. at 601.  The present case, to be sure, is not  \\na vagueness challenge.  But the rule of lenity – and  \\nthe \"constitutional principles underlying th[at] rule,\" \\nDavis , 139 S. Ct. at 2333 n. 8 – counsels against \\nadopting a line of authority whose own proponents \\nreport fluidity at best and havoc at worst. \\n                                                 \\n8 In another footnote, the Fourth Circuit noted that Carr had \\nother \"state convictions\" on different dates, at least one of which \\ninvolved \"assault by pointing a gun,\" Carr , 592 F.3d at 639 n.3, \\nbut did not analyze whether they  constituted ACCA predicates \\nor rely on them for its holding. \\n 23 \\n3. The Seventh Circuit\\'s decision in United States \\nv. Hudspeth , 42 F.3d 1015 (7th Cir. 1994) (en banc), \\ninvolved Thomas Hudspeth, who on one day in 1983 broke into three businesses – \"a doughnut shop, a dry \\ncleaners, and an insurance company.\"  Id. at 1018-19.  \\nThe businesses were in the same \"strip mall,\" id., \\nwhere the burglars made \"a hole through [a] shared wall\" and \"forced open the door\" connecting two of \\nthe businesses, id. at 1022.  The whole affair took \\n\"approximately thirty-five minutes.\"  Id. at 1018-19.  \\nA majority of the Seventh Circuit held that, because Hudspeth\\'s three offenses were \"committed sequen-\\ntially, against different victims, at different times, \\nand at different locations,\" they were \"clearly crimes \\n\\'committed on occasions different from one another.\\'\"  Id. at 1021. \\nOne concurrence reasoned that Hudspeth was \\n\"appropriately sentenced because . . . the record shows three separate crimes against separate victims \\nand not a single crime or criminal occasion (whatever that is).\"  Id. at 1025 (Bauer, J., concurring).  One \\npartial dissent noted that past decisions had \"grappl[ed] with the ambi guity of the ACCA\" and \\nnoted \"the malleability of the relevant terms,\" including the different-occasions language.  Id. at \\n1025-26 (Flaum, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Another, joined by  five of the 11 judges who \\nheard the case, agreed that the \"cold print of the \\nstatute books\" did not answ er the question before  \\nthe court and argued for interpreting § 924(e) as  \\na \"congressional mandate . . . to identify the true recidivist.\"  Id. at 1034, 1037 (Ripple, J., concurring \\nin part and dissenting in part).  \\nNone of the opinions in Hudspeth suggested \\napplying the rule of lenity.  Yet at least six members \\n 24 \\nof the en banc court – counting Judge Bauer, whose \\nconcurrence expressed marked frustration with the \\nstatutory language – appear to have found no answer \\nto the question before them in § 924(e).9  As judicial \\nexperience goes, that is further evidence that \\n\"Congress le[ft] to the Judiciary the task of imputing \\nto Congress an undeclared will,\" Bell, 349 U.S. at 83, \\nconcerning prior offenses that occur over a short \\nperiod of time in several adjacent structures.'}, {'B. Evading or Resisting Arrest Does Not Clearly Involve Multiple Different \"Occasions\"': 'Another  situation that repeatedly arises under \\n§ 924(e) is an offense af ter which the defendant \\nevades or resists arrest.  A rule that focuses on \\nsequence in time treats evasion or resistance as a \\ndifferent \"occasion,\" because it is possible to imagine a point at which the defendant stops the first offense \\nand starts running.  But an ordinary person trying  \\nto figure out the meaning of the statute from its \\nwords would not likely reach that conclusion.  Nor  \\ndo the tools of statutory construction suggest that \\nCongress meant to treat such an offender as a career \\ncriminal deserving 15 years in prison. \\n1. In United States v. Schieman , 894 F.2d 909 \\n(7th Cir. 1990), David Schi eman received a 15-year \\nsentence based in part on prior convictions of \\nburglary and aggravated batte ry of a police officer.  \\nId. at 910.  As a partial dissent explained:  \\n                                                 \\n9 Hudspeth relied on police reports to determine the circum-\\nstances of prior offenses; Shepard v. United States , 544 U.S. 13, \\n16 (2005), later barred courts from considering police reports  \\nin applying § 924(e).  The Seventh Circuit has since cited  \\nHudspeth as \"abrogated\" at least in part by Shepard .  See, e.g., \\nUnited States v. Elliott , 703 F.3d 378, 384 n.3 (7th Cir. 2012). \\n 25 \\nSchieman committed a robbery, walked three \\nblocks away to make a telephone call [at a phone \\nbooth] to arrange transportation away from the \\nscene, and, in an attempt to evade apprehension, \\npushed a police officer at the phone booth.  The \\npushing incident occurred approximately five \\nminutes after the robbery. \\nId. at 913 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and \\ndissenting in part).  The majority reasoned that, \"[o]nce the original crime is complete, there is no \\nprincipled way to distinguish\" between a battery \\n\"within ten minutes of the burglary\" and one \"a day after the burglary.\"  Id. at  913 (majority). \\nOne giving the words \"different\" and \"occasion\" \\ntheir ordinary meaning might well think that both \\nSchieman\\'s burglary and his attempt to escape five \\nminutes later occurred on the same occasion.  One \\nthinking of the statute as an attempt to identify \\ncareer criminals would reach the same result.  And \\nthe Schieman court\\'s reasoning only emphasizes  \\nhow traditional principles of lenity support that conclusion.  The court took a case it thought clear \\n(escape a day later) and used it to resolve a case  \\nit thought unclear (escape five minutes later) by \\narguing the lack of a \"principled . . . distin[ction]\" \\nbetween the two.  But the felt need to invoke the day-after hypothetical itself shows that the statute does \\nnot speak clearly to the five -minute case.  The court\\'s \\nrole was therefore to limit the 15-year sanction to the \\ncase where it was unambiguously intended. \\n2. In United States v. Davidson , 527 F.3d 703 \\n(8th Cir. 2008), vacated in part on other grounds , 551 \\nF.3d 807 (8th Cir. 2008) (per curiam), Mark Davidson \\nwas sentenced under § 924(e)  based on prior convic-\\ntions that included an attempted domestic assault \\n 26 \\nand fleeing from a police officer who interrupted that \\nattempt with a traffic stop.  Id. at 707.  The Seventh \\nCircuit conceded that the \"pause between the two offenses was brief\" and that the crimes were \\ncommitted in \"rapid succession,\" but reasoned that  \\na \"moment of relative calm\" had occurred when  \\nthe officer stopped Davidson, creating \"a point of \\ndemarcation between episodes\" that justified treating \\nDavidson\\'s prior convictions as separate.  Id. at 710. \\nThe Davidson court candidly acknowledged that \\nthe circuits had \"struggled with th[e] problem\" of applying § 924(e) to resist ance or evasion offenses, \\n\"reaching arguably inconsistent results,\" id. at 709, \\ndiscussing Schieman and other examples.  Considered \\nas an exercise in the common-law method, the \"point of demarcation\" analysis that Davidson derived \\nmight not be exceptional.  But it has been settled \\nsince United States v. Hudson , 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 32 \\n(1812), that \"federal crimes . . . are solely creatures of \\nstatute,\" Liparota v. United States , 471 U.S. 419, 424 \\n(1985), a principle that lenity helps protect, see id. at \\n427-28.  And the distinction that Davidson and cases \\nlike it draw – if it can even be squared with the \\nstatute at all – is clearly a rule made by the courts \\nrather than one set down by statute. \\n3. In Levering v. United States , 890 F.3d 738 (8th \\nCir. 2018), Merwyn Leveri ng was sentenced under \\n§ 924(e) based on prior convictions that included at \\nleast two assaults in the cour se of a high-speed flight \\nfrom police officers in a stolen automobile.  Id. at \\n739.  Levering argued that the assaults were not committed on different occasions because the flight \\nwas a \"\\'continuous course of conduct.\\'\"  Id. at 741.  \\nThe Eighth Circuit acknowledged that \"the phrase \\n\\'continuous course of conduct\\' appears in our cases on \\n 27 \\nthis subject,\" but rejected  it as \"unhelpful to the \\nanalysis.\"  Id. at 742.  Instead, the court relied on the \\nfact that the assaults were committed \"at different times in different counties against different victims.\"  \\nId.  The Eighth Circuit acknowledged that several \\nunpublished decisions from the Sixth Circuit pointed \\nto a different result, but \"respectfully differ[ed]\" with them.  Id.   \\nLike the Fourth Circuit\\'s acknowledgment of \"havoc\" \\nin Carr , the vigorous disagreement among members \\nof the Seventh Circuit in Hudspeth , and the Eighth \\nCircuit\\'s own earlier acknowledgment of \"arguabl[e] \\ninconsisten[cy]\" in Davidson , the reasoning of \\nLevering points to the type of pervasive uncertainty \\nabout statutory application that suggests courts have gone beyond the guidance that an unclear statute \\ncan offer.  It is especially  telling that – as the Eighth \\nCircuit\\'s criticism of the Sixth Circuit shows – courts theoretically applying the sa me sequential test reach \\ndifferent results as to similarly situated defendants. \\n4. None of this is to deny that fleeing from arrest \\nand assaulting someone while doing so is not serious misconduct that state and sometimes federal law \\nproperly criminalize.  The police officer in Schieman \\ncould have been hurt, as could the bystanders to the \\nhigh-speed chases in Davidson and Levering .  Nor is \\nthere any doubt that after their prior convictions the \\nvarious defendants were prohibited from possessing guns, see 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), and could be punished \\nfor breaking that law.  The function of § 924(e), \\nhowever – as its text, structure, and history all show – is to carve out a special set of repeat offenders, \\nlabeled as \"armed career criminals,\" for special \\ncondemnation and harsh mandatory punishment.  It \\nis impossible to read the cases struggling with these \\n 28 \\nissues and conclude that the legislature has \"clearly \\nsaid\" that those defendants should \"languish[] in \\nprison,\" Bass , 404 U.S. at 348 (cit ation omitted), for \\nat least 15 years.'}]\n"

MADIGAN, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF ILLINOISv.TELEMARKETING ASSOCIATES, INC., ET AL.\\nNo. 01-1806.\\nSupreme Court of United States.\\nArgued March 3, 2003.\\nDecided May 5, 2003.\\n\\nRespondents, Illinois for-profit fundraising corporations and their owner (collectively Telemarketers), were retained by VietNow National Headquarters, a charitable nonprofit corporation, to solicit donations to aid Vietnam veterans. The contracts between those parties provided, among other things, that Telemarketers would retain 85 percent of the gross receipts from Illinois donors, leaving 15 percent for VietNow. The Illinois Attorney General filed a complaint in state court, alleging, inter alia, that Telemarketers represented to donors that a significant amount of each dollar donated would be paid over to VietNow for specifically identified charitable endeavors, and that such representations were knowingly deceptive and materially false, constituted a fraud, and were made for Telemarketers\\' private pecuniary benefit. The trial court granted Telemarketers\\' motion to dismiss the fraud claims on First Amendment grounds. In affirming, the Illinois Appellate and Supreme Courts placed heavy weight on Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U. S. 620, Secretary of State of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U. S. 947, and Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781. Those decisions held that certain regulations of charitable solicitation barring fees in excess of a prescribed level effectively imposed prior restraints on fundraising, and were therefore incompatible with the First Amendment. The state high court acknowledged that this case involved no such prophylactic proscription of high-fee charitable solicitation. Instead, the court noted, the Attorney General sought to enforce the State\\'s generally applicable antifraud laws against Telemarketers for specific instances of deliberate deception. However, the Illinois Supreme Court said, Telemarketers\\' solicitation statements were alleged to be false only because Telemarketers contracted for 85 percent of the gross receipts and failed to disclose this information to donors. The court concluded that the Attorney General\\'s complaint was, in essence, an attempt to regulate Telemarketers\\' ability to engage in a protected activity based upon a percentage-rate limitation — the same regulatory principle rejected in Schaumburg, Munson, and Riley. Held: Consistent with this Court\\'s precedent and the First Amendment, States may maintain fraud actions when fundraisers make false or misleading representations designed to deceive donors about how their donations will be used. The Illinois Attorney General\\'s allegations against Telemarketers therefore state a claim for relief that can survive a motion to dismiss. Pp. 611-624.\\n(a) The First Amendment protects the right to engage in charitable solicitation, see, e. g., Schaumburg, 444 U. S., at 632, but does not shield fraud, see, e. g., Donaldson v. Read Magazine, Inc., 333 U. S. 178, 190. Like other forms of public deception, fraudulent charitable solicitation is unprotected speech. See, e. g., Schneider v. State (Town of Irvington), 308 U. S. 147, 164. This Court has not previously addressed the First Amendment\\'s application to individual fraud actions of the kind at issue here. It has, however, three times held unconstitutional prophylactic laws designed to combat fraud by imposing prior restraints on solicitation when fundraising fees exceeded a specified reasonable level. Pp. 611-617.\\n(b) In those cases, Schaumburg, Munson, and Riley, the Court took care to leave a corridor open for fraud actions to guard the public against false or misleading charitable solicitations. See, e. g., Schaumburg, 444 U. S., at 637. As those decisions recognized, there are differences critical to First Amendment concerns between fraud actions trained on representations made in individual cases and statutes that categorically ban solicitations when fundraising costs run high. Simply labeling an action one for \"fraud,\" of course, will not carry the day. Had the State Attorney General\\'s complaint charged fraud based solely on the percentage of donations the fundraisers would retain, or their failure to alert donors to fee arrangements at the start of each call, Riley would support swift dismissal. Portions of the Attorney General\\'s complaint against Telemarketers were of this genre. But the complaint and annexed affidavits, in large part, alleged not simply what Telemarketers failed to convey. They also described what Telemarketers misleadingly represented. Taking into account the affidavits, and reading the complaint in the light most favorable to the Attorney General, that pleading described misrepresentations this Court\\'s precedent does not place under the First Amendment\\'s cover. First, the complaint asserted that Telemarketers affirmatively represented that a significant amount of each dollar donated would be paid over to VietNow to be used for specific charitable purposes while in fact Telemarketers knew that 15 cents or less of each dollar would be available for those purposes. Second, the complaint essentially alleged that the charitable solicitation was a façade: Although Telemarketers represented that donated funds would go to VietNow\\'s charitable purposes, the amount of funds paid over to the charity was merely incidental to the fundraising effort, which was made for Telemarketers\\' private pecuniary benefit. Fraud actions so tailored, targeting misleading affirmative representations about how donations would be used, are unlike the prophylactic measures invalidated in Schaumburg, Munson, and Riley: So long as the emphasis is on what the fundraisers misleadingly convey, and not on percentage limitations on solicitors\\' fees per se, fraud actions need not impermissibly chill protected speech. Pp. 617-619.\\n(c) The prohibitions invalidated in Schaumburg, Munson, and Riley turned solely on whether high percentages of donated funds were spent on fundraising. Their application did not depend on whether the fundraiser made fraudulent representations to potential donors. In contrast to the prior restraints inspected in those cases, a properly tailored fraud action targeting specific fraudulent representations employs no \"`[b]road prophylactic rul[e],\\'\" Schaumburg, 444 U. S., at 637 (citation omitted), lacking any \"nexus ... [to] the likelihood that the solicitation is fraudulent,\" Riley, 487 U. S., at 793. Such an action thus falls on the constitutional side of the line \"between regulation aimed at fraud and regulation aimed at something else in the hope that it would sweep fraud in during the process.\" Munson, 467 U. S., at 969-970. The Attorney General\\'s complaint has a solid core in allegations that home in on Telemarketers\\' affirmative statements designed to mislead donors regarding the use of their contributions. Of prime importance, to prove a defendant liable for fraud under Illinois case law, the State must show by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant knowingly made a false representation of a material fact, that such representation was made with the intent to mislead the listener, and that the representation succeeded in doing so. In contrast to a prior restraint on solicitation, or a regulation that imposes on fundraisers an uphill burden to prove their conduct lawful, the State bears the full burden of proof in an individualized fraud action. Exacting proof requirements of this order, in other contexts, have been held to provide sufficient breathing room for protected speech. See, e. g., New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 279-280. As an additional safeguard responsive to First Amendment concerns, an appellate court could independently review the trial court\\'s findings. Cf. Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485, 498-511. What the First Amendment and this Court\\'s case law emphatically do not require, however, is a blanket exemption from fraud liability for a fundraiser who intentionally misleads in calls for donations. While the percentage of fundraising proceeds turned over to a charity is not an accurate measure of the amount of funds used \"for\" a charitable purpose, Munson, 467 U. S., at 967, n. 16, the gravamen of the fraud action in this case is not high costs or fees, but particular representations made with intent to mislead. The Illinois Attorney General has not suggested that a charity must desist from using donations for legitimate purposes such as information dissemination, advocacy, and the like. Rather, the Attorney General has alleged that Telemarketers attracted donations by misleading potential donors into believing that a substantial portion of their contributions would fund specific programs or services, knowing full well that was not the case. Such representations remain false or misleading, however legitimate the other purposes for which the funds are in fact used. The Court does not agree with Telemarketers that the Attorney General\\'s fraud action is simply an end run around Riley\\'s holding that fundraisers may not be required, in every telephone solicitation, to state the percentage of receipts the fundraiser would retain. It is one thing to compel every fundraiser to disclose its fee arrangements at the start of a telephone conversation, quite another to take fee arrangements into account in assessing whether particular affirmative representations designedly deceive the public. Pp. 619-623.\\n(d) Given this Court\\'s repeated approval of government efforts to enable donors to make informed choices about their charitable contributions, see, e. g., Schaumburg, 444 U. S., at 638, almost all States and many localities require charities and professional fundraisers to register and file regular reports on their activities, particularly their fundraising costs. These reports are generally available to the public and are often placed on the Internet. Telemarketers do not object on First Amendment grounds to these disclosure requirements. Just as government may seek to inform the public and prevent fraud through such requirements, so it may vigorously enforce antifraud laws to prohibit professional fundraisers from obtaining money on false pretenses or by making false statements. Riley, 487 U. S., at 800. High fundraising costs, without more, do not establish fraud, see id., at 793, and mere failure to volunteer the fundraiser\\'s fee when contacting a potential donee, without more, is insufficient to state a claim for fraud, id., at 795-801. But these limitations do not disarm States from assuring that their residents are positioned to make informed choices about their charitable giving. Pp. 623-624.\\n198 Ill. 2d 345, 763 N. E. 2d 289, reversed and remanded.\\nGINSBURG, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court. SCALIA, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which THOMAS, J., joined, post, p. 624.\\n\\n\\n1\\nCERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF ILLINOIS.\\n\\n\\n2\\nRichard S. Huszagh, Assistant Attorney General of Illinois, argued the cause for petitioner. With him on the briefs were Lisa Madigan, Attorney General, James E. Ryan, former Attorney General, Joel D. Bertocchi, Solicitor General, Barry B. Gross, Chief Deputy Attorney General, and Jerald S. Post, Floyd D. Perkins, and Matthew D. Shapiro, Assistant Attorneys General.\\n\\n\\n3\\nDeputy Solicitor General Clement argued the cause for the United States et al. as amici curiae urging reversal. With him on the brief were Solicitor General Olson, Assistant Attorney General McCallum, Matthew D. Roberts, Jacob M. Lewis, and Catherine Hancock.\\n\\n\\n4\\nErrol Copilevitz argued the cause for respondents. With him on the brief were William E. Raney, Mackenzie Canter III, and Mark Diskin.*\\n\\n\\n5\\nJUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\\n\\n\\n6\\nThis case concerns the amenability of for-profit fundraising corporations to suit by the Attorney General of Illinois for fraudulent charitable solicitations. The controversy arises from the fundraisers\\' contracts with a charitable nonprofit corporation organized to advance the welfare of Vietnam veterans; under the contracts, the fundraisers were to retain 85 percent of the proceeds of their fundraising endeavors. The State Attorney General\\'s complaint alleges that the fundraisers defrauded members of the public by falsely representing that \"a significant amount of each dollar donated would be paid over to [the veterans organization] for its [charitable] purposes while in fact the [fundraisers] knew that ... 15 cents or less of each dollar would be available\" for those purposes. App. 9, ¶ 34. Complementing that allegation, the complaint states that the fundraisers falsely represented that \"the funds donated would go to further ... charitable purposes,\" id., at 8, ¶ 29, when in fact \"the amount ... paid over to charity was merely incidental to the fund raising effort,\" which was conducted primarily \"for the private pecuniary benefit of\" the fundraisers, id., at 9, ¶ 35.\\n\\n\\n7\\nThe question presented is whether those allegations state a claim for relief that can survive a motion to dismiss. In accord with the Illinois trial and appellate courts, the Illinois Supreme Court held they did not. That court was \"mindful of the opportunity for public misunderstanding and the potential for donor confusion which may be presented with fund-raising solicitations of the sort involved in th[is] case,\" Ryan v. Telemarketing Associates, Inc., 198 Ill. 2d 345, 363, 763 N. E. 2d 289, 299 (2001); it nevertheless concluded that threshold dismissal of the complaint was compelled by this Court\\'s decisions in Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U. S. 620 (1980), Secretary of State of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U. S. 947 (1984), and Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781 (1988). Those decisions held that certain regulations of charitable subscriptions, barring fees in excess of a prescribed level, effectively imposed prior restraints on fundraising, and were therefore incompatible with the First Amendment.\\n\\n\\n8\\nWe reverse the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court. Our prior decisions do not rule out, as supportive of a fraud claim against fundraisers, any and all reliance on the percentage of charitable donations fundraisers retain for themselves. While bare failure to disclose that information directly to potential donors does not suffice to establish fraud, when nondisclosure is accompanied by intentionally misleading statements designed to deceive the listener, the First Amendment leaves room for a fraud claim.\\n\\n\\n9\\n* Defendants below, respondents here, Telemarketing Associates, Inc., and Armet, Inc., are Illinois for-profit fundraising corporations wholly owned and controlled by defendant-respondent Richard Troia. 198 Ill. 2d, at 347-348, 763 N. E. 2d, at 291. Telemarketing Associates and Armet were retained by VietNow National Headquarters, a charitable nonprofit corporation, to solicit donations to aid Vietnam veterans. Id., at 348, 763 N. E. 2d, at 291. In this opinion, we generally refer to respondents, collectively, as \"Telemarketers.\"\\n\\n\\n10\\nThe contracts between the charity, VietNow, and the fundraisers, Telemarketers, provided that Telemarketers would retain 85 percent of the gross receipts from donors within Illinois, leaving 15 percent for VietNow. Ibid. Under the agreements, donor lists developed by Telemarketers would remain in their \"sole and exclusive\" control. App. 24, 93-94, 102, ¶ 65. Telemarketers also brokered contracts on behalf of VietNow with out-of-state fundraisers; under those contracts, out-of-state fundraisers retained between 70 percent and 80 percent of donated funds, Telemarketers received between 10 percent and 20 percent as a finder\\'s fee, and VietNow received 10 percent. 198 Ill. 2d, at 348, 763 N. E. 2d, at 291. Between July 1987 and the end of 1995, Telemarketers collected approximately $7.1 million, keeping slightly more than $6 million for themselves, and leaving approximately $1.1 million for the charity. Ibid.1\\n\\n\\n11\\nIn 1991, the Illinois Attorney General filed a complaint against Telemarketers in state court. Id., at 348-350, 763 N. E. 2d, at 291-292.2 The complaint asserted common-law and statutory claims for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty. Ibid. It alleged, inter alia, that the 85 percent fee for which Telemarketers contracted was \"excessive\" and \"not justified by expenses [they] paid.\" App. 103, ¶ 72. Dominantly, however, the complaint concerned misrepresentation.\\n\\n\\n12\\nIn the course of their telephone solicitations, the complaint states, Telemarketers misleadingly represented that \"funds donated would go to further Viet[N]ow\\'s charitable purposes.\" Id., at 8, ¶ 29. Affidavits attached to the complaint aver that Telemarketers told prospective donors their contributions would be used for specifically identified charitable endeavors; typical examples of those endeavors include \"food baskets given to vets [and] their families for Thanksgiving,\" id., at 124, paying \"bills and rent to help physically and mentally disabled Vietnam vets and their families,\" id., at 131, \"jo[b] training,\" id., at 145, and \"rehabilitation [and] other services for Vietnam vets,\" id., at 169 (some capitalization omitted in quotes). One affiant asked what percentage of her contribution would be used for fundraising expenses; she \"was told 90% or more goes to the vets.\" Ibid. (capitalization omitted). Another affiant stated she was told her donation would not be used for \"labor expenses\" because \"all members are volunteers.\" Id., at 111 (capitalization omitted).3 Written materials Telemarketers sent to each donor represented that contributions would \"be used to help and assist Viet[N]ow\\'s charitable purposes.\" Id., at 8, ¶ 30.4\\n\\n\\n13\\nThe 15 cents or less of each solicited dollar actually made available to VietNow, the Attorney General charged, \"was merely incidental to the fund raising effort\"; consequently, she asserted, \"representations made to donors [that a significant amount of each dollar donated would be paid over to Viet[N]ow for its purposes] were knowingly deceptive and materially false, constituted a fraud[,] and were made for the private pecuniary benefit of [Telemarketers].\" Id., at 9, ¶ 34, 35.\\n\\n\\n14\\nTelemarketers moved to dismiss the fraud claims, urging that they were barred by the First Amendment. The trial court granted the motion,5 and the dismissal order was affirmed, in turn, by the Illinois Appellate Court and the Illinois Supreme Court. The Illinois courts placed heavy weight on three decisions of this Court: Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U. S. 620 (1980); Secretary of State of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U. S. 947 (1984); and Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781 (1988). Each of the three decisions invalidated state or local laws that categorically restrained solicitation by charities or professional fundraisers if a high percentage of the funds raised would be used to cover administrative or fundraising costs. Schaumburg, 444 U. S., at 620; Munson, 467 U. S., at 947; and Riley, 487 U. S., at 781; see 198 Ill. 2d, at 359, 763 N. E. 2d, at 297.\\n\\n\\n15\\nThe Illinois Supreme Court acknowledged that this case, unlike Schaumburg, Munson, and Riley, involves no prophylactic provision proscribing any charitable solicitation if fundraising costs exceeded a prescribed limit. Instead, the Attorney General sought to enforce the State\\'s generally applicable antifraud laws against Telemarketers for \"specific instances of deliberate deception.\" 198 Ill. 2d, at 358, 763 N. E. 2d, at 296 (quoting Riley, 487 U. S., at 803 (SCALIA, J., concurring)). \"However,\" the court said, \"the statements made by [Telemarketers] during solicitation are alleged to be `false\\' only because [Telemarketers] retained 85% of the gross receipts and failed to disclose this information to donors.\" 198 Ill. 2d, at 359, 763 N. E. 2d, at 297. The Attorney General\\'s complaint, in the Illinois Supreme Court\\'s view, was \"in essence, an attempt to regulate [Telemarketers\\'] ability to engage in a protected activity based upon a percentage-rate limitation\" — \"the same regulatory principle that was rejected in Schaumburg[,] Munson, and Riley.\" Ibid.\\n\\n\\n16\\n\"[H]igh solicitation costs,\" the Illinois Supreme Court stressed, \"can be attributable to a number of factors.\" Ibid. In this case, the court noted, Telemarketers contracted to provide a \"wide range\" of services in addition to telephone solicitation. Ibid. For example, they agreed to publish a newsletter and to maintain a toll-free information hotline. Id., at 359-360, 763 N. E. 2d, at 297-298. Moreover, the court added, VietNow received \"nonmonetary benefits by having [its] message disbursed by the solicitation process,\" and Telemarketers were directed to solicit \"in a manner that would `promote goodwill\\' on behalf of VietNow.\" Id., at 361, 763 N. E. 2d, at 298. Taking these factors into account, the court concluded that it would be \"incorrect to presume ... [any] nexus between high solicitation costs and fraud.\" Id., at 360, 763 N. E. 2d, at 298.\\n\\n\\n17\\nThe Illinois Supreme Court further determined that, under Riley, \"fraud cannot be defined in such a way that it places on solicitors the affirmative duty to disclose to potential donors, at the point of solicitation, the net proceeds to be returned to the charity.\" Id., at 361, 763 N. E. 2d, at 298.6 Finally, the court expressed the fear that if the complaint were allowed to proceed, all fundraisers in Illinois would be saddled with \"the burden of defending the reasonableness of their fees, on a case-by-case basis, whenever in the Attorney General\\'s judgment the public was being deceived about the charitable nature of a fund-raising campaign because the fund-raiser\\'s fee was too high.\" Id., at 362, 763 N. E. 2d, at 299. The threatened exposure to litigation costs and penalties, the court said, \"could produce a substantial chilling effect on protected speech.\" Ibid. We granted certiorari. 537 U. S. 999 (2002).\\n\\nII\\n\\n18\\nThe First Amendment protects the right to engage in charitable solicitation. See Schaumburg, 444 U. S., at 632 (\"charitable appeals for funds ... involve a variety of speech interests—communication of information, the dissemination and propagation of views and ideas, and the advocacy of causes — that are within the protection of the First Amendment\"); Riley, 487 U. S., at 788-789. But the First Amendment does not shield fraud. See, e. g., Donaldson v. Read Magazine, Inc., 333 U. S. 178, 190 (1948) (the government\\'s power \"to protect people against fraud\" has \"always been recognized in this country and is firmly established\"); Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323, 340 (1974) (the \"intentional lie\" is \"no essential part of any exposition of ideas\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Like other forms of public deception, fraudulent charitable solicitation is unprotected speech. See, e. g., Schneider v. State (Town of Irvington), 308 U. S. 147, 164 (1939) (\"Frauds,\" including \"fraudulent appeals ... made in the name of charity and religion,\" may be \"denounced as offenses and punished by law.\"); Donaldson, 333 U. S., at 192 (\"A contention cannot be seriously considered which assumes that freedom of the press includes a right to raise money to promote circulation by deception of the public.\").\\n\\n\\n19\\nThe Court has not previously addressed the First Amendment\\'s application to individual fraud actions of the kind at issue here. It has, however, three times considered prophylactic statutes designed to combat fraud by imposing prior restraints on solicitation when fundraising fees exceeded a specified reasonable level. Each time, the Court held the prophylactic measures unconstitutional.\\n\\n\\n20\\nIn Schaumburg, decided in 1980, the Court invalidated a village ordinance that prohibited charitable organizations from soliciting contributions unless they used at least 75 percent of their receipts \"directly for the charitable purpose of the organization.\" 444 U. S., at 624 (internal quotation marks omitted). The ordinance defined \"charitable purposes\" to exclude salaries and commissions paid to solicitors, and the administrative expenses of the charity, including salaries. Ibid. The village of Schaumburg\\'s \"principal justification\" for the ordinance was fraud prevention: \"[A]ny organization using more than 25 percent of its receipts on fund-raising, salaries, and overhead,\" Schaumburg submitted, \"is not a charitable, but a commercial, for-profit enterprise\"; \"to permit [such an organization] to represent itself as a charity,\" the village urged, \"is fraudulent.\" Id., at 636.\\n\\n\\n21\\nThe Court agreed with Schaumburg that fraud prevention ranks as \"a substantial governmental interes[t],\" ibid., but concluded that \"the 75-percent requirement\" promoted that interest \"only peripherally.\" Ibid. Spending \"more than 25 percent of [an organization\\'s] receipts on fundraising, salaries, and overhead,\" the Court explained, does not reliably indicate that the enterprise is \"commercial\" rather than \"charitable.\" Ibid. Such spending might be altogether appropriate, Schaumburg noted, for a charitable organization \"primarily engaged in research, advocacy, or public education [that uses its] own paid staff to carry out these functions as well as to solicit financial support.\" Id., at 636-637. \"The Village\\'s legitimate interest in preventing fraud,\" the Court stated, \"can be better served by measures less intrusive than a direct prohibition on solicitation,\" id., at 637: \"Fraudulent misrepresentations can be prohibited and the penal laws used to punish such conduct directly,\" ibid.\\n\\n\\n22\\nFour years later, in Munson, the Court invalidated a Maryland law that prohibited charitable organizations from soliciting if they paid or agreed to pay as expenses more than 25 percent of the amount raised. Unlike the inflexible ordinance in Schaumburg, the Maryland law authorized a waiver of the 25 percent limitation \"where [it] would effectively prevent the charitable organization from raising contributions.\" 467 U. S., at 950-951, n. 2. The Court held that the waiver provision did not save the statute. Id., at 962. \"[No] reaso[n] other than financial necessity warrant[ed] a waiver,\" Munson observed. Id., at 963. The statute provided no shelter for a charity that incurred high solicitation costs because it chose to disseminate information as part of its fundraising. Ibid. Nor did it shield a charity whose high solicitation costs stemmed from the unpopularity of its cause. Id., at 967.\\n\\n\\n23\\n\"[N]o doubt [there] are organizations that have high fundraising costs not due to protected First Amendment activity,\" the Court recognized; it concluded, however, that Maryland\\'s statute was incapable of \"distinguish[ing] those organizations from charities that have high costs due to protected First Amendment activities.\" Id., at 966. The statute\\'s fatal flaw, the Court said, was that it \"operate[d] on [the] fundamentally mistaken premise that high solicitation costs are an accurate measure of fraud.\" Ibid. As in Schaumburg, the Court noted, fraud could be checked by \"measures less intrusive than a direct prohibition on solicitation\": Fraud could be punished directly and the State \"could require disclosure of the finances of a charitable organization so that a member of the public could make an informed decision about whether to contribute.\" 467 U. S., at 961, and n. 9.\\n\\n\\n24\\nThird in the trilogy of cases on which the Illinois Supreme Court relied was our 1988 decision in Riley. The village ordinance in Schaumburg and the Maryland law in Munson regulated charities; the North Carolina charitable solicitation controls at issue in Riley directly regulated professional fundraisers. North Carolina\\'s law prohibited professional fundraisers from retaining an \"unreasonable\" or \"excessive\" fee. 487 U. S., at 784 (internal quotation marks omitted). Fees up to 20 percent of the gross receipts collected were deemed reasonable; fees between 20 percent and 35 percent were deemed unreasonable if the State showed that the solicitation did not involve advocacy or dissemination of information. Id., at 784-785. Fees exceeding 35 percent were presumed unreasonable, but the fundraiser could rebut the presumption by showing either that the solicitation involved advocacy or information dissemination, or that, absent the higher fee, the charity\\'s \"ability to raise money or communicate would be significantly diminished.\" Id., at 785-786.\\n\\n\\n25\\nRelying on Schaumburg and Munson, the Court\\'s decision in Riley invalidated North Carolina\\'s endeavor to rein in charitable solicitors\\' fees. The Court held, once again, that fraud may not be inferred simply from the percentage of charitable donations absorbed by fundraising costs. See 487 U. S., at 789 (\"solicitation of charitable contributions is protected speech\"; \"using percentages to decide the legality of the fundraiser\\'s fee is not narrowly tailored to the State\\'s interest in preventing fraud\").\\n\\n\\n26\\nThe opportunity to rebut the unreasonableness presumption attending a fee over 35 percent did not bring North Carolina\\'s scheme within the constitutional zone, the Court explained. Under the State\\'s law, \"even where a prima facie showing of unreasonableness ha[d] been rebutted, the factfinder [still had to] make an ultimate determination, on a case-by-case basis, as to whether the fee was reasonable — a showing that the solicitation involved ... advocacy or [the] dissemination of information [did] not alone establish that the total fee was reasonable.\" Id., at 786.\\n\\n\\n27\\nTraining on that aspect of North Carolina\\'s regulation, the Court stated: \"Even if we agreed that some form of a percentage-based measure could be used, in part, to test for fraud, we could not agree to a measure that requires the speaker to prove `reasonableness\\' case by case based upon what is at best a loose inference that the fee might be too high.\" Id., at 793. \"[E]very campaign incurring fees in excess of 35% ... [would] subject [fundraisers] to potential litigation over the `reasonableness\\' of the fee,\" the Court observed; that litigation risk, the Court concluded, would \"chill speech in direct contravention of the First Amendment\\'s dictates.\" Id., at 794. Especially likely to be burdened, the Riley opinion noted, were solicitations combined with advocacy or the communication of information, and fundraising by small or unpopular charities. Ibid. The Court cautioned, however, as it did in Schaumburg and Munson, that States need not \"sit idly by and allow their citizens to be defrauded.\" 487 U. S., at 795. We anticipated that North Carolina law enforcement officers would be \"ready and able\" to enforce the State\\'s antifraud law. Ibid.\\n\\n\\n28\\nRiley presented a further issue. North Carolina law required professional fundraisers to disclose to potential donors, before asking for money, the percentage of the prior year\\'s charitable contributions the fundraisers had actually turned over to charity. Ibid. The State defended this disclosure requirement as a proper means to dispel public misperception that the money donors gave to professional fundraisers went in greater-than-actual proportion to benefit charity. Id., at 798.\\n\\n\\n29\\nThis Court condemned the measure as an \"unduly burdensome\" prophylactic rule, an exaction unnecessary to achieve the State\\'s goal of preventing donors from being misled. Id., at 800. The State\\'s rule, Riley emphasized, conclusively presumed that \"the charity derive[d] no benefit from funds collected but not turned over to it.\" Id., at 798. This was \"not necessarily so,\" the Court said, for charities might well benefit from the act of solicitation itself, when the request for funds conveyed information or involved cause-oriented advocacy. Ibid.\\n\\n\\n30\\nThe Court noted in Riley that North Carolina (like Illinois here) required professional fundraisers to disclose their professional status. Id., at 799; see Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 225, § 460/17(a) (2001); supra, at 609, n. 4, 611, n. 6. That disclosure, the Court said, effectively notified contributors that a portion of the money they donated would underwrite solicitation costs. A concerned donor could ask how much of the contribution would be turned over to the charity, and under North Carolina law, fundraisers would be obliged to provide that information. Riley, 487 U. S., at 799 (citing N. C. Gen. Stat. § 131C-16 (1986)). But upfront telephone disclosure of the fundraiser\\'s fee, the Court believed, might end as well as begin the conversation: A potential contributor who thought the fee too high might simply hang up. 487 U. S., at 799-800. \"[M]ore benign and narrowly tailored options\" that would not chill solicitation altogether were available; for example, the Court suggested, \"the State may itself publish the detailed financial disclosure forms it requires professional fundraisers to file,\" and \"[it] may vigorously enforce its antifraud laws to prohibit professional fundraisers from obtaining money on false pretenses or by making false statements.\" Ibid.\\n\\nIII\\n\\n31\\n* The Court\\'s opinions in Schaumburg, Munson, and Riley took care to leave a corridor open for fraud actions to guard the public against false or misleading charitable solicitations. See Schaumburg, 444 U. S., at 637; Munson, 467 U. S., at 961, and n. 9; Riley, 487 U. S., at 795, 800.7 As those decisions recognized, and as we further explain below, there are differences critical to First Amendment concerns between fraud actions trained on representations made in individual cases and statutes that categorically ban solicitations when fundraising costs run high. See Part III-B, infra. Simply labeling an action one for \"fraud,\" of course, will not carry the day. For example, had the complaint against Telemarketers charged fraud based solely on the percentage of donations the fundraisers would retain, or their failure to alert potential donors to their fee arrangements at the start of each telephone call, Riley would support swift dismissal.8 A State\\'s Attorney General surely cannot gain case-by-case ground this Court has declared off limits to legislators.\\n\\n\\n32\\nPortions of the complaint in fact filed by the Attorney General are of this genre. See, e. g., App. 103, ¶ 72 (asserting that Telemarketers\\' charge \"is excessive\" and \"not justified by expenses [they] paid\"); id., at 86, ¶ 67H-67I (alleging statutory violations based on failure to disclose to prospective donors Telemarketers\\' percentage fee). As we earlier noted, however, see supra, at 608-609, the complaint and annexed affidavits, in large part, alleged not simply what Telemarketers failed to convey; they also described what Telemarketers misleadingly represented.\\n\\n\\n33\\nUnder Illinois law, similar to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \"[w]hen the legal sufficiency of a complaint is challenged by a ... motion to dismiss, all well-pleaded facts in the complaint are taken as true and [the court] must determine whether the allegations ..., when interpreted in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, are sufficient to establish a cause of action upon which relief may be granted.\" Connick v. Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd., 174 Ill. 2d 482, 490, 675 N. E. 2d 584, 588 (1997) (emphasis added). Dismissal is proper \"only if it clearly appears that no set of facts can be proved under the pleadings which will entitle the plaintiff to recover.\" 198 Ill. 2d, at 351, 763 N. E. 2d, at 293.\\n\\n\\n34\\nTaking into account the affidavits, and reading the complaint in the light most favorable to the Attorney General, that pleading described misrepresentations our precedent does not place under the First Amendment\\'s cover. First, it asserted that Telemarketers affirmatively represented that \"a significant amount of each dollar donated would be paid over to Viet[N]ow\" to be used for specific charitable purposes — rehabilitation services, job training, food baskets, and assistance for rent and bills, App. 9, ¶ 34; id., at 124, 131, 145, 163, 169, 187, 189 — while in reality Telemarketers knew that \"15 cents or less of each dollar\" was \"available to Viet[N]ow for its purposes.\" Id., at 9, ¶ 34. Second, the complaint alleged, essentially, that the charitable solicitation was a façade: Although Telemarketers represented that donated funds would go to VietNow\\'s specific \"charitable purposes,\" id., at 8, ¶ 29, the \"amount of funds being paid over to charity was merely incidental to the fund raising effort,\" which was made \"for the private pecuniary benefit of [Telemarketers] and their agents,\" id., at 9, ¶ 35. Cf., e. g., Voices for Freedom, CCH Trade Reg. ¶ 23,080 (1993) [1987-1993 Transfer Binder] (complaint against fundraisers who, inter alia, represented that \"substantial portions of the funds from [the sale of commemorative bracelets] would be used to support a message center for the troops stationed in the Persian Gulf,\" but \"did not use substantial portions of the bracelet-sales proceeds to support the message center\").\\n\\n\\n35\\nFraud actions so tailored, targeting misleading affirmative representations about how donations will be used, are plainly distinguishable, as we next discuss, from the measures invalidated in Schaumburg, Munson, and Riley: So long as the emphasis is on what the fundraisers misleadingly convey, and not on percentage limitations on solicitors\\' fees per se, such actions need not impermissibly chill protected speech.\\n\\nB\\n\\n36\\nIn Schaumburg, Munson, and Riley, the Court invalidated laws that prohibited charitable organizations or fundraisers from engaging in charitable solicitation if they spent high percentages of donated funds on fundraising — whether or not any fraudulent representations were made to potential donors. Truthfulness even of all representations was not a defense. See supra, at 612-616. In contrast to the prior restraints inspected in those cases, a properly tailored fraud action targeting fraudulent representations themselves employs no \"[b]road prophylactic rul[e],\" Schaumburg, 444 U. S., at 637 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), lacking any \"nexus ... [to] the likelihood that the solicitation is fraudulent,\" Riley, 487 U. S., at 793. Such an action thus falls on the constitutional side of the line the Court\\'s cases draw \"between regulation aimed at fraud and regulation aimed at something else in the hope that it would sweep fraud in during the process.\" Munson, 467 U. S., at 969-970. The Illinois Attorney General\\'s complaint, in this light, has a solid core in allegations that home in on affirmative statements Telemarketers made intentionally misleading donors regarding the use of their contributions. See supra, at 608-609.\\n\\n\\n37\\nOf prime importance, and in contrast to a prior restraint on solicitation, or a regulation that imposes on fundraisers an uphill burden to prove their conduct lawful, in a properly tailored fraud action the State bears the full burden of proof. False statement alone does not subject a fundraiser to fraud liability. As restated in Illinois case law, to prove a defendant liable for fraud, the complainant must show that the defendant made a false representation of a material fact knowing that the representation was false; further, the complainant must demonstrate that the defendant made the representation with the intent to mislead the listener, and succeeded in doing so. See In re Witt, 145 Ill. 2d 380, 391, 583 N. E. 2d 526, 531 (1991). Heightening the complainant\\'s burden, these showings must be made by clear and convincing evidence. See Hofmann v. Hofmann, 94 Ill. 2d 205, 222, 446 N. E. 2d 499, 506 (1983).9\\n\\n\\n38\\nExacting proof requirements of this order, in other contexts, have been held to provide sufficient breathing room for protected speech. See New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 279-280 (1964) (action for defamation of public official); Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485, 502, and n. 19 (1984) (noting \"kinship\" between New York Times standard and \"motivation that must be proved to support a common-law action for deceit\").10 As an additional safeguard responsive to First Amendment concerns, an appellate court could independently review the trial court\\'s findings. Cf. Bose Corp., 466 U. S., at 498-511 (de novo appellate review of findings regarding actual malice). What the First Amendment and our case law emphatically do not require, however, is a blanket exemption from fraud liability for a fundraiser who intentionally misleads in calls for donations.\\n\\n\\n39\\nThe Illinois Supreme Court in the instant case correctly observed that \"the percentage of [fundraising] proceeds turned over to a charity is not an accurate measure of the amount of funds used `for\\' a charitable purpose.\" 198 Ill. 2d, at 360, 763 N. E. 2d, at 298 (citing Munson, 467 U. S., at 967, n. 16). But the gravamen of the fraud action in this case is not high costs or fees, it is particular representations made with intent to mislead. If, for example, a charity conducted an advertising or awareness campaign that advanced charitable purposes in conjunction with its fundraising activity, its representation that donated funds were going to \"charitable purposes\" would not be misleading, much less intentionally so. Similarly, charitable organizations that engage primarily in advocacy or information dissemination could get and spend money for their activities without risking a fraud charge. See Schaumburg, 444 U. S., at 636-637; Munson, 467 U. S., at 963; Riley, 487 U. S., at 798-799.11\\n\\n\\n40\\nThe Illinois Attorney General here has not suggested that a charity must desist from using donations for information dissemination, advocacy, the promotion of public awareness, the production of advertising material, the development or enlargement of the charity\\'s contributor base,12 and the like. Rather, she has alleged that Telemarketers attracted donations by misleading potential donors into believing that a substantial portion of their contributions would fund specific programs or services, knowing full well that was not the case. See supra, at 608-609, 618-619. Such representations remain false or misleading, however legitimate the other purposes for which the funds are in fact used.\\n\\n\\n41\\nWe do not agree with Telemarketers that the Illinois Attorney General\\'s fraud action is simply an end run around Riley\\'s holding that fundraisers may not be required, in every telephone solicitation, to state the percentage of receipts the fundraiser would retain. See Brief for Respondents 14-19. It is one thing to compel every fundraiser to disclose its fee arrangements at the start of a telephone conversation, quite another to take fee arrangements into account in assessing whether particular affirmative representations designedly deceive the public.\\n\\nC\\n\\n42\\nOur decisions have repeatedly recognized the legitimacy of government efforts to enable donors to make informed choices about their charitable contributions. In Schaumburg, the Court thought it proper to require \"disclosure of the finances of charitable organizations,\" thereby to prevent fraud \"by informing the public of the ways in which their contributions will be employed.\" 444 U. S., at 638. In Munson, the Court reiterated that \"disclosure of the finances of a charitable organization\" could be required \"so that a member of the public could make an informed decision about whether to contribute.\" 467 U. S., at 961-962, n. 9. And in Riley, the Court said the State may require professional fundraisers to file \"detailed financial disclosure forms\" and may communicate that information to the public. 487 U. S., at 800; see also id., at 799, n. 11 (State may require fundraisers \"to disclose unambiguously [their] professional status\").\\n\\n\\n43\\nIn accord with our precedent, as Telemarketers and their amici acknowledge, in \"[a]lmost all of [the] states and many localities,\" charities and professional fundraisers must \"register and file regular reports on activities[,] particularly fundraising costs.\" Brief for Respondents 37; see Brief for Independent Sector et al. as Amici Curiae 6-8. These reports are generally available to the public; indeed, \"[m]any states have placed the reports they receive from charities and professional fundraisers on the Internet.\" Brief for Respondents 39; see Brief for Independent Sector et al. as Amici Curiae 9-10. Telemarketers do not object on First Amendment grounds to these disclosure requirements. Tr. of Oral Arg. 43.\\n\\n\\n44\\nJust as government may seek to inform the public and prevent fraud through such disclosure requirements, so it may \"vigorously enforce ... antifraud laws to prohibit professional fundraisers from obtaining money on false pretenses or by making false statements.\" Riley, 487 U. S., at 800. High fundraising costs, without more, do not establish fraud. See id., at 793. And mere failure to volunteer the fundraiser\\'s fee when contacting a potential donee, without more, is insufficient to state a claim for fraud. Id., at 795-801. But these limitations do not disarm States from assuring that their residents are positioned to make informed choices about their charitable giving. Consistent with our precedent and the First Amendment, States may maintain fraud actions when fundraisers make false or misleading representations designed to deceive donors about how their donations will be used.\\n\\n\\n45\\n*   *   *\\n\\n\\n46\\nFor the reasons stated, the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\\n\\n\\n47\\n\\nIt is so ordered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\n\\n*\\n Briefs ofamici curiae urging reversal were filed for the State of Florida et al. by Richard E.

Comp. Stat., ch. 735, § 5/2-606 (1992);Pure Oil Co. v. Miller-McFarland Drilling Co., 376 Ill. 486, 497-498, 34 N. E. 2d 854, 859 (1941); 3 R. Michael, Illinois Practice § 23.9, pp. 332-333, nn. 7-9 and accompanying text (1989) (collecting Illinois cases). Telemarketers\\' counsel stated at oral argument that the Illinois Supreme Court had \"found as a matter of law that [the] affidavits were not part of the complaint.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 40. We can locate no such finding in the court\\'s opinion. Asked to supply a citation after argument, see id., at 41, counsel directed us to the court\\'s statement that \"there is no allegation that [Telemarketers] made affirmative misstatements to potential donors.\" 198 Ill. 2d 345, 348, 763 N. E. 2d 289, 291 (2001)); see Letter from William E. Raney to William K. Suter, Clerk of the Court (Mar. 4, 2003). In so stating, the Illinois court overlooked, most obviously, the two affidavits attesting to Telemarketers\\' representations that \"90% or more goes to the vets,\" and that there would be no \"labor expenses.\" See App. 111, 169 (capitalization omitted). In any event, the sentence fragment counsel identified falls short of showing, in the face of established Illinois case law, that the court \"found\" the affidavits annexed by the Illinois Attorney General dehors the complaint. Counsel\\'s contention is further clouded by the Illinois Supreme Court\\'s explicit notation that \"the Attorney General ha[d] attached to his complaint the affidavits of 44 VietNow donors.\" 198 Ill. 2d, at 352, 763 N. E. 2d, at 293.\\n\\n\\n4\\n Illinois law provides that \"[i]n any solicitation to the public for a charitable organization by a professional fund raiser or professional solicitor[,] [t]he public member shall be promptly informed by statement in verbal communications and by clear and unambiguous disclosure in written materials that the solicitation is being made by a paid professional fund raiser. The fund raiser, solicitor, and materials used shall also provide the professional fund raiser\\'s name and a statement that contracts and reports regarding the charity are on file with the Illinois Attorney General and additionally, in verbal communications, the solicitor\\'s true name must be provided.\" Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 225, § 460/17(a) (2001)\\n\\n\\n5\\n The parties subsequently stipulated to the dismissal of all remaining claims. App. to Pet. for Cert. 30-31\\n\\n\\n6\\n Contracts for fundraising campaigns in Illinois must be filed with the State\\'s Attorney General, see Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 225, §§ 460/2(a)(10) and 460/7 (2001), and those contracts must disclose all fundraiser fees, including any \"stated percentage of the gross amount raised\" to be retained by the fundraiser, § 460/7(b); see § 460/7(d). The filings are open for public inspection. § 460/2(f). Illinois law also provides that fundraisers must disclose \"the percentage to be received by the charitable organization from each contribution, if such disclosure is requested by the person solicited.\" § 460/17(b). Telemarketers did not challenge these requirements\\n\\n\\n7\\n We are therefore unpersuaded by Telemarketers\\' plea that they lacked fair notice of their vulnerability to fraud actions. See Brief for Respondents 46, 49-50\\n\\n\\n8\\n Although fundraiser retention of 85 percent of donations is significantly higher than the 35 percent limit inRiley, this Court has not yet accepted any percentage-based measure as dispositive. See supra, at 615 (quoting Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 793 (1988)).\\n\\n\\n9\\n InRiley, this Court expressed concern that case-by-case litigation over the reasonableness of fundraising fees would inhibit speech. 487 U. S., at 793-794. That concern arose in large measure because the North Carolina statute there at issue placed the burden of proof on the fundraiser. The Court has long cautioned that, to avoid chilling protected speech, the government must bear the burden of proving that the speech it seeks to prohibit is unprotected. See Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U. S. 51, 58 (1965); Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513, 525-526 (1958). The government shoulders that burden in a fraud action.\\n\\n\\n10\\n Although this case does not present the issue, the Illinois Attorney General urges that a constitutional requirement resembling \"actual malice\" does not attend \"every form of liability by charitable solicitors who misrepresent the use of donations.\" Reply Brief 16-17, n. 11 (internal quotation marks omitted). We confine our consideration to the complaint in this case, which alleged that Telemarketers \"acted with knowledge of the falsity of their representations.\" Ibid.\\n\\n\\n11\\n Amicus Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), for example, states that its mission is \"to communicate the message `Don\\'t Drink and Drive.\\'\" Brief for Public Citizen, Inc., et al. as Amici Curiae 13. Telephone solicitors retained by MADD \"reach millions of people a year, and each call educates the public about the tragedy of drunk driving, provides statistics and asks the customer to always designate a sober driver.\" Ibid. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Solicitations that described MADD\\'s charitable mission would not be fraudulent simply because MADD devotes a large proportion of its resources to fundraising calls, for those calls themselves fulfill its advocacy/information dissemination mission.\\n\\n\\n12\\n This Court has consistently recognized that small or unpopular charities would be hindered by limitations on the portion of receipts they could devote to subscription building. SeeSecretary of State of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U. S. 947, 967 (1984); Riley, 487 U. S., at 794.\\n\\n\\n\\n48\\nJUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins, concurring.\\n\\n\\n49\\nThe question presented by the petition for certiorari in this case reads as follows: \"Whether the First Amendment categorically prohibits a State from pursuing a fraud action against a professional fundraiser who represents that donations will be used for charitable purposes but in fact keeps the vast majority (in this case 85 percent) of all funds donated.\" Pet. for Cert. i. I join the Court\\'s opinion because I think it clear from the opinion that if the only representation made by the fundraiser were the one set forth in the question presented (\"that donations will be used for charitable purposes\"), and if the only evidence of alleged failure to comply with that representation were the evidence set forth in the question presented (that the fundraiser \"keeps the vast majority (in this case 85 percent) of all funds donated\"), the answer to the question would be yes.\\n\\n\\n50\\nIt is the teaching of Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781, 793 (1988), and Secretary of State of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U. S. 947, 966 (1984), that since there is such wide disparity in the legitimate expenses borne by charities, it is not possible to establish a maximum percentage that is reasonable. It also follows from that premise that there can in general be no reasonable expectation on the part of donors as to what fraction of the gross proceeds goes to expenses. When that proposition is combined with the unquestionable fact that one who is promised, without further specification, that his charitable contribution will go to a particular cause must reasonably understand that it will go there after the deduction of legitimate expenses, the conclusion must be that the promise is not broken (and hence fraud is not committed) by the mere fact that expenses are very high. Today\\'s judgment, however, rests upon a \"solid core\" of misrepresentations, ante, at 620, that go well beyond mere commitment of the collected funds to the charitable purpose.\\n\\n']}\n",

The greatest cost of reading a mandatory minimu m too broadly is that individual defendants lose their liberty. Mandatory minimum provisions are, by design, severe. They often tie an additional prison sentence of years or decades (here, a decade and a half) to a single factual determination. Such provisions therefore speak to the core concern that has motivated courts to apply the rule of lenity for centuries: the \"instinctive 9 distaste[] against men lang uishing in prison unless the lawmaker has clearly sa id they should.\" Henry J. Friendly, \"Mr. Justice Frankfurter and the Reading of Statutes,\" in Benchmarks 196, 209 (1967), quoted in <MASK>f9bf5075-a171-4563-b4ce-39b2107ca692</MASK>.

Further, mandatory minimum provisions often are said to reflect (at least in theory) the moral judgment of the community that particular conduct deserves harsher punishment. In our system of government, that judgment is reserved to the legislature. The rule of lenity ensures that criminal sentences actually reflect legislative judgment, rather than guesswork by the courts abo ut what the legislature meant. See Granderson , 511 U.S. at 69 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment) (\"'[B]ecause criminal punishment usually represents the moral condemna- tion of the community, legislatures and not courts should define criminal activity,' and set the punish- ments therefor.\") (quoting Bass , 404 U.S. at 348) (citation omitted); R.L.C. , 503 U.S. at 309 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and co ncurring in the judgment) (describing one of \"the rule of lenity's . . . purpose[s]\" as \"assuring that the society, through its represen- tatives, has genuinely called for the punishment to be meted out\"); Wiltberger , 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) at 95 (explaining that \"[t]he rule that penal laws are to be construed strictly\" is founded not merely on \"tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals\" but also on the \"plain principle that the power of 10 punishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial department\"). Any criminal statute presents these concerns, but mandatory minimum provisions make them particularly weighty. Unlike other criminal laws, mandatory minimums are exceptions to the principle that courts should \"impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary,\" to accomplish the goals of criminal punishme nt after considering \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1). A mandatory minimum is a congressional directive to subordinate justice in individual cases to a perceived need for greater deterrence or incapacitation generally. Congress may choose to make that tradeoff (within constitu- tional bounds), but the courts should ensure that Congress has actually made that choice before imposing needlessly harsh punishments. Cf. <MASK>fdd151f3-d585-44d6-acff-0cb46f73f060</MASK>. 2. The adverse consequences of erroneously expanding mandatory sentencing beyond the limits of congressional intent affect more than just individual defendants.

Further, the rule of leni ty historically has been justified in part based on the \"principle of legality\": conduct can be criminalized , and penalties author- ized, only by legislative action, so \"that the amount of discretion entrusted to those who enforce the law does not exceed tolerable lim its.\" Herbert L. Packer, The Limits of the Criminal Sanction 93 (1968). As the Court put it in <MASK>19f7c992-500c-4d48-95bf-da9e1f6e9be0</MASK>, \"prosecutorial discretion\" to enforce a statute with \"wide-rangin g scope . . . places great power in the hands of the prosecutor,\" creating risks of \"nonuniform execution\" and \"arbitary prosecution.\" Id. at 1108-09.

And it is a special problem with mandatory minimums that effectively transfer sentencing discretion from the trial judge, \"the one actor in the system most ex perienced with exercising discretion,\" to \"an assistant prosecutor not trained in the exercise of discretion.\" An Address by Anthony M. Kennedy, Associate Justic e, Supreme Court of the United States, Speech at the American Bar Associ- ation Annual Meeting (Aug. 9, 2003), available at https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/speeches/sp_08-09-03.html. 12 Inconsistently exercised discretion means that, in practice, mandatory minimums fail to yield even uniformity in sentencing – the benefit they are supposed to obtain at the cost of individual justice and proportionality. Over decades, the Sentencing Commission has repeatedly reported \"inconsisten[cy]\" and \"wide geographic variations\" in the use of mandatory minimum sentences. E.g., United States Sentencing Comm'n, Application and Impact of 21 U.S.C. § 851: Enhanced Penalties for Federal Drug Trafficking Offenders 6 (July 2018) (finding \"significant variation in the extent to which . . . enhanced penalties were sought against eligible offenders\"); see also <MASK>8b0a0512-d907-412d-853a-5a21197532aa</MASK>. 2 2 See also United States Sentencing Comm'n, Mandatory Minimum Penalties for Sex Offenses in the Federal Criminal Justice System 56 (Jan. 2019) (finding that, \"[i]n fiscal year 2016, the mandatory minimum penalty for receipt [of child por-nography] [wa]s inconsistently applied,\" leading to \"substantial\" differences in sentences where \"the conduct involved in the offenses was not meaningfully distinguishable\"); United States Sentencing Comm'n, Report to Congress: Mandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System 345 (Oct. 2011) (\"2011 Report\") (finding \"inconsistencies in application of certain mandatory minimum penalties, as shown by . . . data analyses and confirmed by interviews of prosecutors and defense attorneys\"); United States Sentencing Comm'n, Fifteen Years of Guidelines Sentencing: An Assessment of How Well the Federal Criminal Justice System is Achieving the Goals of Sentencing Reform 89 (Nov. 2004) (\"Research over the past fifteen years has consistently found that mandatory penalty statutes are used inconsistently in cases in which they appear to apply.\"). 13 Indeed, over the last two decades, different Attorneys General have instructed federal prose- cutors differently on how to use mandatory minimum statutes, switching between more- and less-aggressive approaches.3 In adopting such policies, the executive branch takes into its own hands the tradeoff between sentencing uniformity, on the one hand, and individual justice and proportionality, on the other. Whatever the wisdom of the competing approaches, that practice emphasizes how mandatory minimum statutes transfer power over individual liberty from lawmakers and judges to pr osecutors. In our adver- sarial system, moreover, pr osecutors can and do use that power strategically in ways that undermine structural protections for individual liberties, such as by using the threat of a mandatory minimum to obtain a guilty plea.

Supp. 2d at 1253 & n.120 (discussing a 2003 memorandum intended \"to reduce charging disparities stemming from § 924(c)\"); United States Sentencing Comm'n, An Overview of Mandatory Minim um Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System 24-25 (July 2017) (comparing the 2013 \"Smart on Crime\" initiative, which outlined circumstances in which prosecutors should \"'decline to charge'\" mandatory minimum sentences, to \"revised guidance\" in 2017 directing prosecutors generally to \"'charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense,'\" with seriousness measured by the greatest sentence, \" 'including mandatory minimum sentences' \"). 14 Nor does the expansion of prosecutorial power through mandatory minimum statutes stop at the charging stage. Even after conviction, the prosecutor holds an important key to lessening the effect of a mandatory minimum sentence. A district court is freed from restrictions on its sentencing discretion \"[u]pon motion of the Government . . . so as to reflect a defendant's substantial assistance in the investi-gation or prosecution of another person,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e), or it can similarly reduce the sentence later, again with the government's approval, under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b)(4). 4 Suc h discretionary motions have large effects on sentences, often reducing them by many years.5 Research has found \"enorm ous differences in how prosecutors exercise that di scretion, with substantial variation by district.\"6 Again, within broad constitu- tional bounds, Congress has the power to create such a system. But the Court need not and should not broaden more than Congress's language requires 4 In certain cases involving no n-violent drug offenders, a district judge may invoke 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f), often called a judicial \"safety valve,\" but the sa fety valve is \"narrow\" and still requires prosecutorial approval in substance if not in form. Rachel E. Barkow, Categorical Mistakes: The Flawed Frame- work of the Armed Career Criminal Act and Mandatory Mini- mum Sentencing , 133 Harv. L. Rev. 200, 218 (2019). 5 See United States Sentencing Comm'n, Mandatory Minimum Penalties for Firearms Offenses in the Federal Criminal Justice System 42 (Mar. 2018) (\"In fiscal year 2016, the average sentence for offenders who remained subject to the mandatory minimum penalty [under § 924(e)] at sentencing was 200 months, signifi-cantly longer than the average sentence for offenders relieved of this mandatory minimum penalty (112 months).\"). 6 Barkow, Categorical Mistakes , 133 Harv. L. Rev. at 224 & n.183, 236 & n.281 (discussing the 2011 and 1991 Reports). 15 statutes that give prosecutors powers over individual lives traditionally reserved for independent judges. 3. By contrast, the costs of erroneously construing a mandatory minimum provision too narrowly are relatively low, both for individual cases and for the criminal justice system as a whole. In cases that fall outside the scope of a mandatory minimum, but that nevertheless feature aggravating circumstances similar to those that moved Congress to impose the minimum, a sentencing judge still has discretion (guided by § 3553(a) and the sentencing guidelines) to impose a more severe sentence. As Justice Breyer explained in Dean , \"an interpretive error on the side of leniency[] still permits the sentencing judge to impose a sentence similar to, perhaps close to, the statutor y sentence even if that sentence . . . is not legislatively required .\" 556 U.S. at 584 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Moreover, \"an error that excludes (erroneously) a set of instances Congress me ant to include . . . could lead the Sentencing Commission to focus on those cases . . . [and] make avail able to Congress a body of evidence and analysis that w ill help it reconsider the statute.\" Id. at 585. Those who bring actions under the criminal laws (the executive branch) have far greater access to thos e who create them (the legislative branch) than do those who defend against such actions (potential criminal defendants). In light of this practical reality, the rule of lenity \"places the weight of inertia upon the party that can best induce Congress to speak more clearly.\" Santos , 553 U.S. at 514 (plurality). 16\n",

      "1. The decision under review is a useful starting point. According to the Sixth Circuit, all 10 of Wooden's 1997 convictions for burglary, which took place on a single night, were \"separate ACCA predicate offenses\" that occurred on \"'occasions different from one another.'\" JA21 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1)). To support that conclusion, the court of appeals reasoned that, \"[w]hatever the contours of a 'mini' wareho use, Wooden could not be in two (let alone ten) of them at once\"; that he \"could have ceased his criminal conduct\" after entering the first warehouse without en tering nine more; and that, although \"one could characterize th[e] cluster of warehouses as being adjoined 'at the same business location,'\" they were \"different locations\" because their owners had \"distinct se ts of property rights.\" JA23-24. Wooden argues persuasively (at 30) that the \"textual foundations\" for the court of appeals' \"test . . . are essentially nonexistent.\" Even if the statute does not wholly foreclose th at test, it certainly gives no fair warning that unlawfully entering 10 small warehouses within the same building on a single evening triggers a harsh 15-year penalty for later owning a gun, while spending the same amount of time in a single warehouse would not. The court of appeals' analysis thus \"mak[es] criminal law in Congress's stead.\" Santos , 553 U.S. at 514 (plurality). At best it is judicial doctrine built up to cover the lack of clarity in the statute, rather than anything that can claim to be an application of the statute itself. Those who agree with Justice Scalia that \"it is not consistent with the rule of lenity 21 to construe a textually ambiguous penal statute against a criminal defendant on the basis of legis- lative history,\" R.L.C. , 503 U.S. at 307 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment), can stop there, because the statute is at least textually ambiguous. Those who look to legislative history as an interpretive guide should reach the same ultimate conclusion. As Wooden persuasively shows (at 21- 25), that history ranges fr om an Assistant Attorney General's 1984 testimony that the statute was meant to catch \"people who have demonstrated . . . that locking them up and letting them go doesn't do any good,\" Pet. Br. Add. 29a; to the Solicitor General's 1987 concession in Petty that the statute was \"intended\" to cover \"multiple criminal episodes,\" id. at 26a; to then-Senator Biden's 1988 statement that the statute was meant to \"express[] [a] concept of what is meant by a 'career criminal,'\" 134 Cong. Rec. S17,370 (daily ed. Nov. 10, 1988). None of this suggests an intent – let alone a clear one – to consider multiple offenses on a single night to be a career in crime because it took a few seconds to move from one mini-warehouse to another within a cluster of such warehouses. 2. The Fourth Circuit's decision in <MASK>aac0fc0c-2ad6-4640-9433-4e5e3e601163</MASK>, illustrates the same point. That case involved Daryl Carr, who possessed a firearm after previously pleading guilty to 13 state-law charges of \"felony breaking or entering.\" Id. at 638. Those 13 offenses all took place on a single day in 2006 during which Carr broke into each of 13 \"different storage unit[s]\" at the same street addres s (\"N.C. 32 South\"). Id. The court of appeals conceded that the offenses were \"substantively the same and arguably had the same 22 criminal objective,\" but it nevertheless found them to be \"separate and distinct criminal episodes.\" Id. at 645. It reasoned that the storage units were \"different locations\"; that mo st, though not all, of the offenses had \"different victims\"; and that Carr \"had the opportunity . . . to cease and desist his criminal behavior\" between one storage unit and the next, adding in a footnote that \"Carr simply could not have broken into or entered the 13 separate storage units simultaneously.\" Id. at 645 & n.8 (citation omitted). 8 In that analysis, the Fourth Circuit asserted that the statutory \"'definition may be clear'\" but conceded that \"'the factual permutations surrounding the ACCA tend to create havoc'\"; that \"'courts have applied a multiplicity of factors'\" in cases involving § 924(e); and that the \"analysis\" has a \"fluid nature.\" Id. at 640 (quoting <MASK>d3e0290c-e183-453c-8798-8eb85a4807b0</MASK>). That sort of assessment ought to be a warning sign in construing a criminal statute: it calls to mind this Court's observation in Johnson that \"pervasive disagreement about the nature of the inquiry one is supposed to conduct and the kinds of factors one is supposed to consider\" is a sign of unacceptable vagueness. 576 U.S. at 601. The present case, to be sure, is not a vagueness challenge. But the rule of lenity – and the \"constitutional principles underlying th[at] rule,\" Davis , 139 S. Ct. at 2333 n. 8 – counsels against adopting a line of authority whose own proponents report fluidity at best and havoc at worst. 8 In another footnote, the Fourth Circuit noted that Carr had other \"state convictions\" on different dates, at least one of which involved \"assault by pointing a gun,\" Carr , 592 F.3d at 639 n.3, but did not analyze whether they constituted ACCA predicates or rely on them for its holding. 23 3. The Seventh Circuit's decision in <MASK>942bd57f-10be-4844-9068-1bba4aba26de</MASK>, involved Thomas Hudspeth, who on one day in 1983 broke into three businesses – \"a doughnut shop, a dry cleaners, and an insurance company.\" Id. at 1018-19. The businesses were in the same \"strip mall,\" id., where the burglars made \"a hole through [a] shared wall\" and \"forced open the door\" connecting two of the businesses, id. at 1022. The whole affair took \"approximately thirty-five minutes.\" Id. at 1018-19. A majority of the Seventh Circuit held that, because Hudspeth's three offenses were \"committed sequen- tially, against different victims, at different times, and at different locations,\" they were \"clearly crimes 'committed on occasions different from one another.'\" Id. at 1021. One concurrence reasoned that Hudspeth was \"appropriately sentenced because . . . the record shows three separate crimes against separate victims and not a single crime or criminal occasion (whatever that is).\" Id. at 1025 (Bauer, J., concurring). One partial dissent noted that past decisions had \"grappl[ed] with the ambi guity of the ACCA\" and noted \"the malleability of the relevant terms,\" including the different-occasions language. Id. at 1025-26 (Flaum, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Another, joined by five of the 11 judges who heard the case, agreed that the \"cold print of the statute books\" did not answ er the question before the court and argued for interpreting § 924(e) as a \"congressional mandate . . . to identify the true recidivist.\" Id. at 1034, 1037 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). None of the opinions in Hudspeth suggested applying the rule of lenity. Yet at least six members 24 of the en banc court – counting Judge Bauer, whose concurrence expressed marked frustration with the statutory language – appear to have found no answer to the question before them in § 924(e).9 As judicial experience goes, that is further evidence that \"Congress le[ft] to the Judiciary the task of imputing to Congress an undeclared will,\" Bell, 349 U.S. at 83, concerning prior offenses that occur over a short period of time in several adjacent structures.\n",

      "\"[T]he rule of lenity[] teach[es] that ambiguities about the breadth of a cri minal statute should be resolved in the defendant's favor.\" United <MASK>States v. Davis , 139 S. Ct. 2319, 2333</MASK> ( 2019). That rule has famously been described as \"'perhaps not much less old than' the task of statut ory 'construction itself.'\" Id. (quoting United <MASK>States v. Wiltberger , 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 76, 95 (1820) (Marshall, C.J.))</MASK>. At its core the rule of le nity is an understanding that \"a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed,\" and that, \"[t]o make the warning fair, so far as possible the line sh ould be clear.\" <MASK>McBoyle v. United States , 283 U.S. 25, 27 (1931) (Holmes, J.)</MASK>. In addition, judicial adherence to the rule of lenity also \"places the weight of inertia upon the party\" – that is, the executive branch – \"that can best induce Congress to speak more clearly and keeps courts 7 from making criminal law in Congress's stead.\" United <MASK>States v. Santos , 553 U.S. 507, 514 (2008) (plurality); see Bell v. United States , 349 U.S. 81, 83 (1955) (Frankfurter, J.) (\" When Congress leaves to the Judiciary the task of imputing to Congress an undeclared will, the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of lenity.\")</MASK>. In several cases involving mandatory minimum sentencing provisions, the Court has recognized and applied the \"presupposition . . . [that] doubts in the enforcement of a penal code\" should be \"resolve[d] . . . against the imposition of a harsher punishment.\" Bell, 349 U.S. at 83. Examples include Davis , which invoked lenity to reject a broader saving construction of a different provision of the same mandatory mini- mum statute at issue here, see 139 S. Ct. at 2333; <MASK>Burrage v. United States , 571 U.S. 204 (2014)</MASK>, which described a 15-year mandat ory minimum statute as \"a criminal statute subject to the rule of lenity,\" and lenity as a reason the Court \"[e]specially\" could not depart from the \"ordinary, accepted meaning\" of \"the [statutory] text,\" id. at 216; and United <MASK>States v. Granderson , 511 U.S. 39 (1994)</MASK>, which \"appl[ied] the rule of lenity\" to \"resolve [an] ambiguity\" in a \"mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment\" after revocation of probation, id. at 56-57. Those decisions cohere with others explaining that the rule of lenity assists \"not only to resolve issues about the substantive scope of criminal statutes, but to answer questions about the severity of sentencing.\" United <MASK>States v. R.L.C. , 503 U.S. 291, 306 (1992) (plurality) (citing Bifulco v. United States , 447 U.S. 381, 387 (1980) (collecting cases))</MASK>. Indeed, especially good reasons warrant applying the rule of lenity rigorously to statutes that, like the ACCA, create aggravated offenses with mandatory 8 minimum sentences. A broad construction bars judges from tailoring the sentence to the offense and the offender, leading to particularly harsh conse- quences that only Congress can correct. A narrower construction, by contrast, does not prevent judges from imposing longer sentences where necessary. \"These interpretive asymmetries give the rule of lenity special force in the context of mandatory minimum provisions.\" <MASK>Dean v. United States , 556 U.S. 568, 585 (2009) (Breyer, J., dissenting)</MASK>. Further, experience shows that mandatory mini- mum statutes frequently present difficult problems of statutory construction, creating a heightened risk that courts will read them to impose sentences that Congress never intended. Wh ere, as here, an unclear statute presents a palpable risk of error, courts properly refuse to \"condemn a man to a minimum of 15 years in prison on the basis of . . . speculation,\" <MASK>Begay v. United States , 553 U.S. 137, 154 (2008) (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment)</MASK>, about what Congress meant to say.\n"

      "\"[T]he rule of lenity[] teach[es] that ambiguities about the breadth of a cri minal statute should be resolved in the defendant's favor.\" United <MASK>States v. Davis , 139 S. Ct. 2319, 2333</MASK> ( 2019). That rule has famously been described as \"'perhaps not much less old than' the task of statut ory 'construction itself.'\" Id. (quoting United <MASK>States v. Wiltberger , 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 76, 95 (1820) (Marshall, C.J.))</MASK>. At its core the rule of le nity is an understanding that \"a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed,\" and that, \"[t]o make the warning fair, so far as possible the line sh ould be clear.\" <MASK>McBoyle v. United States , 283 U.S. 25, 27 (1931) (Holmes, J.)</MASK>. In addition, judicial adherence to the rule of lenity also \"places the weight of inertia upon the party\" – that is, the executive branch – \"that can best induce Congress to speak more clearly and keeps courts 7 from making criminal law in Congress's stead.\" United <MASK>States v. Santos , 553 U.S. 507, 514 (2008) (plurality); see Bell v. United States , 349 U.S. 81, 83 (1955) (Frankfurter, J.) (\" When Congress leaves to the Judiciary the task of imputing to Congress an undeclared will, the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of lenity.\")</MASK>. In several cases involving mandatory minimum sentencing provisions, the Court has recognized and applied the \"presupposition . . . [that] doubts in the enforcement of a penal code\" should be \"resolve[d] . . . against the imposition of a harsher punishment.\" Bell, 349 U.S. at 83. Examples include Davis , which invoked lenity to reject a broader saving construction of a different provision of the same mandatory mini- mum statute at issue here, see 139 S. Ct. at 2333; <MASK>Burrage v. United States , 571 U.S. 204 (2014)</MASK>, which described a 15-year mandat ory minimum statute as \"a criminal statute subject to the rule of lenity,\" and lenity as a reason the Court \"[e]specially\" could not depart from the \"ordinary, accepted meaning\" of \"the [statutory] text,\" id. at 216; and United <MASK>States v. Granderson , 511 U.S. 39 (1994)</MASK>, which \"appl[ied] the rule of lenity\" to \"resolve [an] ambiguity\" in a \"mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment\" after revocation of probation, id. at 56-57. Those decisions cohere with others explaining that the rule of lenity assists \"not only to resolve issues about the substantive scope of criminal statutes, but to answer questions about the severity of sentencing.\" United <MASK>States v. R.L.C. , 503 U.S. 291, 306 (1992) (plurality) (citing Bifulco v. United States , 447 U.S. 381, 387 (1980) (collecting cases))</MASK>. Indeed, especially good reasons warrant applying the rule of lenity rigorously to statutes that, like the ACCA, create aggravated offenses with mandatory 8 minimum sentences. A broad construction bars judges from tailoring the sentence to the offense and the offender, leading to particularly harsh conse- quences that only Congress can correct. A narrower construction, by contrast, does not prevent judges from imposing longer sentences where necessary. \"These interpretive asymmetries give the rule of lenity special force in the context of mandatory minimum provisions.\" <MASK>Dean v. United States , 556 U.S. 568, 585 (2009) (Breyer, J., dissenting)</MASK>. Further, experience shows that mandatory mini- mum statutes frequently present difficult problems of statutory construction, creating a heightened risk that courts will read them to impose sentences that Congress never intended. Wh ere, as here, an unclear statute presents a palpable risk of error, courts properly refuse to \"condemn a man to a minimum of 15 years in prison on the basis of . . . speculation,\" <MASK>Begay v. United States , 553 U.S. 137, 154 (2008) (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment)</MASK>, about what Congress meant to say.\n",
