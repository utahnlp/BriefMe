      "271(a) (emphasis added).  In Deepsouth Packing Co. v. \n",
      "Laitram Corp., 406 U.S. 518 (1972), this Court held that \n",
      "a company did not commit infringement by manufactur-\n",
      "ing all of the component parts of a patented machine in \n",
      "the United States and then shipping those parts over-\n",
      "seas for final assembly by a customer.  Id. at 523-525.  \n",
      "The Court explained that, because “[o]ur patent system \n",

      "at 527, 531.  The Court further held that, because the \n",
      "patented product in that case was not “made” until its \n",
      "components were combined abroad, no act of domestic \n",
      "infringement had occurred.  Id. at 529 (citation omit-\n",

      " For decades, however, Monahan has endured—to \n",
      "disastrous effect.  Congress designed the IDEA “to \n",

      "could not have meant, and did not mean, for the IDEA \n",
      "to leave children with disabilities worse off by \n",
      "preempting their rights and remedies under these other statutes, or by imposing procedural obstacles \n",
      "that would not otherwise appl y.  Yet that is precisely \n",
      "how Monahan interprets the IDEA—as a self-\n",

      "At issue here is the recovery of damages that accrue\n",

      "majority of the members of the Association or of the law or\n",

      "in favor of filing this brief, nor any attorney associated with any\n",
      "such officer, director, or committee member in any law or\n",
      "corporate firm, represents a party to this litigation. Some\n",
      "officers, directors, committee members, or associated attorneys\n",

      "The patent damages statute provides prevailing\n",
      "patentees with adequate compensation for damages\n",
      "proximately caused by patent infringement.\n",
      "Specifically, Section 284 provides that “[u]pon\n",

      "In certain cases, patentees may suffer damages\n",
      "abroad as a result of domestic patent infringement.\n",
      "For example, the infringer may make infringing\n",
      "products domestically but sell them in an overseas\n",
      "market, thereby taking profits from the patentee. Or\n",
      "the infringer may sell infringing systems in the U.S.\n",
      "for use in an overseas services market in competition\n",
      "with the patentee. Whatever the nature of the\n",
      "particular market, Section 284 affords complete\n",
      "compensation to the patentee for damages that are\n",
      "proximately caused by domestic infringement.\n",
      "This Court and the Federal Circuit have held that\n",
      "damages accrued overseas as a result of domestic\n",

      "The Court explained that “the general and almost\n",
      "universal rule is that the character of an act as\n",
      "lawful or unlawful must be determined wholly by the\n",
      "law of the country where the act is done.” Id.at 356.\n",
      "It stated that “[f]or another jurisdiction, if it should\n",
      "happen to lay hold of the actor, to treat him\n",
      "according to its own notions rather than those of the\n",
      "place where he did the acts, not only would be\n",
      "unjust, but would be an interference with the\n",
      "authority of another sovereign, contrary to the\n",
      "comity of nations, which the other state concerned\n",
      "justly might resent.” Id.Accordingly, “in case of\n",
      "doubt,” courts should adopt a “construction of any\n",
      "statute as intended to be confined in its operation\n",
      "and effect to the territorial limits over which the\n",
      "lawmaker has general and legitimate power.” Id.at\n",

      "This presumption was again discussed in United\n",
      "States v. Bowman , 260 U.S. 94 (1922). There, the\n",
      "Court considered the defendants’ objection to an\n",
      "indictment charging them with conspiracy to present\n",
      "false claims to the Shipping Board Emergency Fleet\n",
      "Corporation, an entity owned by the United States.\n",
      "Id.at 95-96. The defendants argued that because\n",
      "their scheme unfolded on the high seas, it was\n",
      "outside the scope of the relevant U.S. statute, which\n",
      "did not explicitly impose liability for extraterritorial\n",
      "conduct. Id. at 96-97. The Court described the issue\n",
      "as “a question of statutory construction,” id. at 97,\n",
      "and explained that U.S. statutes were presumed only\n",
      "to punish crimes committed in the United States:\n",
      "17\n",
      "Crimes against private individuals or\n",
      "their property . . . must of course be\n",
      "committed within the territorial\n",
      "jurisdiction of the government where it\n",
      "may properly exercise it. If punishment\n",
      "of them is to be extended to include\n",
      "those committed outside of the strict\n",
      "territorial jurisdiction, it is natural for\n",
      "Congress to say so in the statute, and\n",
      "failure to do so will negative the\n",
      "purpose of Congress in this regard.\n",
      "Id.at 97-98. Thus, from its beginnings in American\n",
      "Banana and Bowman , the presumption against\n",
      "extraterritoriality reflected the common sense\n",
      "insight that U.S. statutes only regulate conduct that\n",
      "occurs in the United States absent a Congressional\n",
      "intent to punish acts that occur abroad.\n",
      "The Court again examined the presumption\n",
      "against extraterritoriality in Foley Bros. v. Filardo ,\n",
      "336 U.S. 281, 284-85 (1949). Foley Bros. concerned\n",
      "the Eight Hour Law, which provided that “[e]very\n",
      "contract” to which the United States is a party must\n",
      "allow for overtime pay to laborers who work more\n",
      "than eight hours in a day. Id.at 282-83. The question\n",
      "presented was whether the reference to “[e]very\n",
      "contract” included contracting projects performed in\n",
      "foreign countries (the plaintiff had served as a cook\n",
      "for a public works project in Iraq and Iran). Id.at\n",
      "283-84. The Court observed that Congress had the\n",
      "power to give the law such a scope, but explained\n",
      "that “[t]he canon of construction which teaches that\n",
      "legislation of Congress, unless a contrary intent\n",
      "appears, is meant to apply only within the territorial\n",
      "18\n",
      "jurisdiction of the United States is a valid approach\n",
      "whereby unexpressed congressional intent may be\n",
      "ascertained.” Id.at 284-85 (citation omitted). This\n",
      "“canon,” said the Court, “is based on the assumption\n",
      "that Congress is primarily concerned with domestic\n",
      "conditions.” Id. Because the Eight Hour Law\n",
      "contained “no language . . . that gives any indication\n",
      "of a congressional purpose to extend its coverage\n",
      "beyond places over which the United States has\n",
      "sovereignty or has some measure of legislative\n",
      "control,” the Court determined that it applied only to\n",

      "traditional fisheries. \n",
      "A. Since time immemorial, the Tribes have depended \n",
      "on their salmon fisheries, an annually renewable re-\n",
      "source that they protected from obstructions.  The Ste-\n",
      "vens Treaties, by “secur[ing]” to the Tribes the “the \n",
      "right of taking fish, at all usual and accustomed grounds \n",
      "and stations,” assured the Tribes lasting federal protec-\n",
      "tion for their preexisting right as they understood it.  \n",
      "The Tribes relied on that protection when agreeing to \n",
      "cede almost all of their territory in return for small land \n",
      "reservations and fishing rights.  And Governor Stevens \n",
      "viewed protecting tribal fisheries as key to his own \n",
      "goals of minimizing costs and avoiding subsidies for the \n",

      "fisheries, yet permitting obstructions that substantially \n",
      "degraded those same fisheries. \n",

      "downstream from no non-state barriers.  J.A. 445a. \n",

      "(Br. 53) that replacement of a downstream state-owned \n",

      "Third, the injunction allows the State to account for \n",
      "the presence of upstream non-state barriers when de-\n",
      "ciding which of its own barriers to prioritize.  The State \n",

      "tions that substantially degrade or destroy the Tribes’ \n",
      "traditional fisheries.  \n",
      "A. Since time immemorial, t he Tribes have depended \n",

      "vens Treaties, b y “secur[ing]” t o the  Tribes the “ the \n",
      "right of taking fish, at all usual and accustomed ground s \n",
      "and stations,” assured  the Tribes lasting federal protec-\n",
      "tion for their preexisting right as they understood it.  \n",
      "The Tribes relied on that protection when agreeing to \n",
      "cede almo st all of their territory in return for small land \n",
      "reservations and fishing rights .  And Governor Stevens \n",
      "viewed  protecting tribal fisheries as key to his own  \n",
      "goal s of minimizing costs and avoiding subsidies for  the \n",
      "Tribes .  Neither party would have unders tood the trea-\n",
      "ties as protecting the Tribes’ access to their traditional fisheries, yet permitting obstructions that substantially \n",
      "degraded those same fisheries.  \n",
      "Contemporaneous sources of law similarly protected \n",
      "fisheries against obstructions.  The law of the Oregon \n",
      "Territory, later adopted for the Washington Territory, \n",
      "16 \n",
      " prohibited obstructing rivers and streams.  And under \n",

      "fish passage.  \n",
      "This Court’s cases have also consistently interpreted \n",

      "reaching the state culvert or a traditional tribal fishing \n",

      "(map showing state barrier s on main stems of streams, \n",

      "(10%) non -state barriers , and a plurality (38%) are \n",
      "downstream from no  non-state barriers .  J.A. 445a. \n",
      "Second, no evidence supports the State’s assertion \n",
      "(Br. 53) that replacement of a downstre am state -owned \n",
      "barrier “will have no impact” if another man -made bar-\n",

      "as having 36 non -state barriers and only one state-\n",

      "Third, the injunction allows the State to account for \n",
      "the presence of upstream non -state barriers when de-\n",
      "ciding which of i ts own b arriers to prioritize.  The State \n",
      "may defer correcting  high -priority culverts ( i.e., those \n",

      "that the State would be permitted to defer remediation of approximately 230 state -owned culverts.  Ibid.   And, \n",
      "of course, the State may defer correction of all  low- \n",

      "or until  an independently undertaken highway project \n",
      "would require replacement anyway.  Id. at 114a.  \n",
