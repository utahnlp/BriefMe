      "proximately caused by patent infringement.\n",
      "Specifically, Section 284 provides that “[u]pon\n",
      "finding for the claimant, the court shall award the\n",
      "claimant damages adequate to compensate for the\n",
      "infringement.” 35 U.S.C. § 284. This Court has held\n",
      "that damages “adequate to compensate” means\n",

      "In certain cases, patentees may suffer damages\n",
      "abroad as a result of domestic patent infringement.\n",
      "For example, the infringer may make infringing\n",
      "products domestically but sell them in an overseas\n",
      "market, thereby taking profits from the patentee. Or\n",
      "the infringer may sell infringing systems in the U.S.\n",
      "for use in an overseas services market in competition\n",
      "with the patentee. Whatever the nature of the\n",
      "particular market, Section 284 affords complete\n",
      "compensation to the patentee for damages that are\n",
      "proximately caused by domestic infringement.\n",
      "This Court and the Federal Circuit have held that\n",
      "damages accrued overseas as a result of domestic\n",
      "patent infringement may be recovered. In this case,\n",
      "however, the Federal Circuit panel majority adopted\n",

      "appears, outside the jurisdiction of the United States\n",
      "and within that of other states.” Id.at 355.\n",
      "The Court explained that “the general and almost\n",
      "universal rule is that the character of an act as\n",
      "lawful or unlawful must be determined wholly by the\n",
      "law of the country where the act is done.” Id.at 356.\n",

      "and effect to the territorial limits over which the\n",

      "This presumption was again discussed in United\n",
      "States v. Bowman , 260 U.S. 94 (1922). There, the\n",

      "outside the scope of the relevant U.S. statute, which\n",
      "did not explicitly impose liability for extraterritorial\n",
      "conduct. Id. at 96-97. The Court described the issue\n",
      "as “a question of statutory construction,” id. at 97,\n",
      "and explained that U.S. statutes were presumed only\n",
      "to punish crimes committed in the United States:\n",
      "17\n",
      "Crimes against private individuals or\n",
      "their property . . . must of course be\n",

      "Id.at 97-98. Thus, from its beginnings in American\n",
      "Banana and Bowman , the presumption against\n",
      "extraterritoriality reflected the common sense\n",
      "insight that U.S. statutes only regulate conduct that\n",

      " \n",
      "The courts below properly concluded that the Ste-\n",
      "vens Treaties prohibit the State from imposing obstruc-\n",
      "tions that substantially degrade or destroy the Tribes’ \n",
      "traditional fisheries. \n",
      "A. Since time immemorial, the Tribes have depended \n",
      "on their salmon fisheries, an annually renewable re-\n",
      "source that they protected from obstructions.  The Ste-\n",
      "vens Treaties, by “secur[ing]” to the Tribes the “the \n",
      "right of taking fish, at all usual and accustomed grounds \n",
      "and stations,” assured the Tribes lasting federal protec-\n",
      "tion for their preexisting right as they understood it.  \n",
      "The Tribes relied on that protection when agreeing to \n",
      "cede almost all of their territory in return for small land \n",
      "reservations and fishing rights.  And Governor Stevens \n",
      "viewed protecting tribal fisheries as key to his own \n",
      "goals of minimizing costs and avoiding subsidies for the \n",
      "Tribes.  Neither party would have understood the trea-\n",
      "ties as protecting the Tribes’ access to their traditional \n",
      "fisheries, yet permitting obstructions that substantially \n",
      "degraded those same fisheries. \n",
      "Contemporaneous sources of law similarly protected \n",

      "the common law, owners of land adjacent to streams \n",
      "through which migratory fish swam could not inhibit \n",
      "fish passage. \n",
      "This Court’s cases have also consistently interpreted \n",
      "the Stevens Treaties as protecting fish stocks against \n",
      "man-made causes of degradation.  Neither the State nor \n",
      "the Tribes have been permitted to frustrate the treaties’ \n",

      "The State’s characterization of the rulings below as \n",

      "removing state-owned barriers will have no effect if \n",
      "other man-made barriers block the same stream.  But \n",
      "non-state barriers tend to be clustered upstream— \n",
      "often far upstream—from the State’s barriers, and \n",
      "\n",
      "18 \n",
      " \n",
      "many non-state barriers allow partial fish passage.  The \n",
      "injunction also gives the State flexibility to account for \n",
      "other obstructions when choosing which barriers to re-\n",
      "mediate and which to defer for correction.  And there is \n",
      "no reason to assume that non-state barriers, which are \n",
      "illegal under state law, will always block streams;  \n",
      "indeed, the record shows the opposite. \n",
      "Second, “extensive evidence, much of it from the \n",
      "State itself,” Pet. App. 115a, shows that the State’s bar-\n",
      "rier culverts have substantially affected salmon har-\n",
      "vests.  State agency reports, expert testimony, and field \n",
      "studies all point to the same conclusion. \n",
      "Third, the State’s assertion that its money would be \n",
      "better spent on other (unspecified) salmon-recovery ef-\n",
      "forts is untimely, given the State’s refusal in the district \n",

      "tion is also contradicted by record evidence showing \n",
      "that replacing barrier culverts is highly cost-effective \n",
      "and fast-working.  The State offers no record support \n",
      "for its estimate, which the district court rejected, that \n",
      "replacement will cost $2.3 million per culvert, nor for its \n",
      "projection that complying with the injunction will cost \n",

      "The State argues (Br. 53) that the injunction “forces \n",

      "no difference to salmon.”  Because the injunction accel-\n",

      " \n",
      "barriers upstream or downstream prevent salmon from \n",
      "reaching the state culvert or a traditional tribal fishing \n",
      "place.”  The State’s argument is unpersuasive for sev-\n",
      "eral reasons. \n",
      "First, trial evidence showed that non-state barriers \n",
      "tend to be highly clustered upstream from state-owned \n",
      "barriers, so that the State’s remediation efforts will al-\n",
      "low the salmon access to significant upstream habitat.  \n",
      "Where a stream has “both state and non-state barriers,” \n",
      "almost 90% of the non-state barriers are upstream of \n",
      "the state-owned barriers.  Pet. App. 111a; see J.A. 97a \n",
      "(map showing state barriers on main stems of streams, \n",
      "with other barriers clustered upstream).  Even for the \n",
      "minority of non-state barriers that are downstream, \n",
      "most (69%) permit partial “passage of fish.”  Pet. App. \n",
      "111a.  And as for the other barriers, many state-owned \n",
      "culverts are downstream from only one (20%) or two \n",
      "(10%) non-state barriers, and a plurality (38%) are \n",
      "downstream from no non-state barriers.  J.A. 445a. \n",
      "Second, no evidence supports the State’s assertion \n",
      "(Br. 53) that replacement of a downstream state-owned \n",
      "barrier “will have no impact” if another man-made bar-\n",
      "rier exists upstream.  Many of the upstream non-state \n",
      "barriers allow partial fish passage, such that eliminat-\n",
      "ing downstream barriers will produce immediate “habi-\n",
      "tat” benefits.  J.A. 779a-780a.  And even where non-\n",
      "state barriers block all fish passage, they are often far \n",
      "upstream.  For instance, on a creek touted by the State \n",
      "as having 36 non-state barriers and only one state-\n",
      "owned barrier, “the nearest non-state barrier is almost \n",
      "a half mile upstream.”  Pet. App. 111a.  The State’s own \n",
      "expert testified that correcting a barrier culvert pro-\n",
      "duces a real “benefit” even where the distance to the \n",
      "\n",
      "50 \n",
      " \n",
      "next upstream barrier is “short.”  J.A. 704a.  And a dif-\n",
      "ferent witness for the State also agreed that the pres-\n",
      "ence of non-state barriers upstream is no excuse for fail-\n",
      "ing to correct state-owned barriers downstream.  J.A. \n",
      "754a. \n",
      "Third, the injunction allows the State to account for \n",
      "the presence of upstream non-state barriers when de-\n",
      "ciding which of its own barriers to prioritize.  The State \n",
      "may defer correcting high-priority culverts (i.e., those \n",
      "blocking more than 200 lineal meters of habitat) that ac-\n",
      "count for up to 10% of “total blocked upstream habitat.”  \n",
      "Pet. App. 115a.  If the State makes “the amount of \n",
      "blocked habitat” the “sole criterion,” evidence shows \n",
      "that the State would be permitted to defer remediation \n",
      "of approximately 230 state-owned culverts.  Ibid.  And, \n",
      "of course, the State may defer correction of all low- \n",
      "priority culverts until the end of the culvert’s useful life, \n",
      "or until an independently undertaken highway project \n",
      "would require replacement anyway.  Id. at 114a. \n",
      "Fourth, and perhaps most fundamentally, the State’s \n",
      "argument is based on an implicit assumption that other \n",
      "barrier culverts upstream of its own will never be re-\n",

      "vens Treaties prohibit the State from imposing obstruc-\n",
      "tions that substantially degrade or destroy the Tribes’ \n",
      "traditional fisheries.  \n",
      "A. Since time immemorial, t he Tribes have depended \n",
      "on their salmon fisheries, an annually renewable re-\n",

      "vens Treaties, b y “secur[ing]” t o the  Tribes the “ the \n",

      "The Tribes relied on that protection when agreeing to \n",
      "cede almo st all of their territory in return for small land \n",
      "reservations and fishing rights .  And Governor Stevens \n",
      "viewed  protecting tribal fisheries as key to his own  \n",
      "goal s of minimizing costs and avoiding subsidies for  the \n",
      "Tribes .  Neither party would have unders tood the trea-\n",
      "ties as protecting the Tribes’ access to their traditional fisheries, yet permitting obstructions that substantially \n",
      "degraded those same fisheries.  \n",
      "Contemporaneous sources of law similarly protected \n",
      "fisheries against obstructions.  The law of the Oregon \n",
      "Territory, later adopted for the Washington Territory, \n",
      "16 \n",
      " prohibited obstructing rivers and streams.  And under \n",
      "the common law, owners of land adjacent to streams \n",
      "through which migratory fish swam could not inhibit \n",
      "fish passage.  \n",
      "This Court’s cases have also consistently interpreted \n",
      "the Stevens Treaties as protecting fish stocks against man -made causes of degradation.  Neither the State nor \n",
      "the Tribes have been permitted to frustrate the treaties’ \n",

      "litigating position —that courts may grant re lief against \n",
      "those whose conduct might “destroy the fisheries” (Br. 41)—is largely consistent with that conclusion. \n",
      "B. The State argues  that relief is precluded here by \n",

      "First, the record shows that replacing the State’s \n",

      "other man -made barriers block the same stream.  But \n",

      "often far upstream —from the State’s barriers, and \n",

      " many non -state barriers allow partial fish passage.  The \n",
      "injunction also gives the State flexibility to account for \n",
      "other obstructions when choosing which barriers to re-\n",
      "mediate and which to defer for correction.  And t here is \n",
      "no reason to assume that non -state barriers, which are \n",
      "illegal under state law, will always block streams;  \n",
      "indeed, the record shows the opposite.  \n",
      "Second, “extensive evidence, much of it from the \n",
      "State itself,” Pet. App. 115a,  shows that the State’s bar-\n",
      "rier culverts have substantially affected salmon har-\n",
      "vests.  State agency reports, expert testimony, and field studies all point to the same conclusion.  \n",
      "Third, the State’s assertion that its money would be \n",
      "better  spent on other (u nspecified) salmon -recovery ef-\n",
      "forts is untimely, given the State’s refusal in the district court to propose alternative relief.  The State’s asser-\n",
      "tion is also contradicted by record evidence showing \n",
      "that replacing barrier culverts is highly  cost-effective \n",
      "and fast -working.  The State  offers no record support \n",
      "for its estimate, which the district court rejected, that \n",
      "replacement will cost $2.3 million per culvert, nor for its \n",
      "projection that complying with the injunction will cost \n",

      "the injunction merely accelerates efforts that the State \n",

      " barriers upstream or downstream prevent salmon from \n",
      "reaching the state culvert or a traditional tribal fishing \n",
      "place.”   The State’s argument is unpersuasive for sev-\n",
      "eral reasons.  \n",
      "First, trial evidence showed that  non-state barriers \n",
      "tend to be highly clustered  upstream from  state -owned \n",
      "barriers , so that the State’s remediation efforts wil l al-\n",
      "low the salmon access to significant upstream habitat .  \n",
      "Where a stream has “both state  and non-state barriers,” \n",
      "almost 90% of the non -state barriers are upstream of \n",
      "the state -owned barriers .  Pet. App. 111a; see J.A. 97a \n",
      "(map showing state barrier s on main stems of streams, \n",
      "with other barriers clustered upstream) .  Even for the \n",
      "minority of non-state barriers  that are downstream , \n",
      "most  (69%) permit partial  “passage of fish.”  Pet. App. \n",
      "111a .  And as for the other  barriers, many state -owned \n",
      "culverts are downstream from only  one (20 %) or two \n",
      "(10%) non -state barriers , and a plurality (38%) are \n",
      "downstream from no  non-state barriers .  J.A. 445a. \n",
      "Second, no evidence supports the State’s assertion \n",
      "(Br. 53) that replacement of a downstre am state -owned \n",
      "barrier “will have no impact” if another man -made bar-\n",
      "rier exists upstream.  M any of the upstream non -state \n",
      "barriers allow partial fish passage, such that eliminat-ing downstream barriers will produce immediate “habi-\n",
      "tat” benefits.  J.A. 779a -780a.  And even where non -\n",
      "state barriers block all  fish passage, they are often far \n",
      "upstream.  For instance, on a creek touted by the State \n",
      "as having 36 non -state barriers and only one state-\n",
      "owned barrier, “the nearest non -state barrier is almost \n",
      "a half mil e upstream.”  Pet. App. 111a.  The State’ s own \n",
      "expert testified that correcting a barrier culvert pro-\n",
      "duces a real “benefit” even where the distance to the \n",
      "50 \n",
      " next upstream  barrier is “short.”  J.A. 704a.  And a dif-\n",
      "ferent witness for the State also agreed that  the pres-\n",
      "ence of non -state barriers upstream is no excuse for fail-\n",
      "ing to correct state -owned barriers downstream.  J.A. \n",
      "754a.  \n",
      "Third, the injunction allows the State to account for \n",
      "the presence of upstream non -state barriers when de-\n",
      "ciding which of i ts own b arriers to prioritize.  The State \n",
      "may defer correcting  high -priority culverts ( i.e., those \n",
      "blocking more than 200 lineal meters of habitat) that ac-\n",
      "count for up to 10% of “total blocked upstream habitat.”  \n",
      "Pet. App. 115a.  If the State makes “the amount of blocked habitat” the “sole criterion ,” evidence shows \n",
      "that the State would be permitted to defer remediation of approximately 230 state -owned culverts.  Ibid.   And, \n",
      "of course, the State may defer correction of all  low- \n",
      "priority culverts  until the end of the culvert’s useful life, \n",
      "or until  an independently undertaken highway project \n",
      "would require replacement anyway.  Id. at 114a.  \n",
      "Fourth, and perhaps most fundamentally, the State’s \n",
      "argument is based on an implicit assumption that  other \n",

      "criminal activity when t he homeowner believes that \n",

      "In addition to these benefits, however, the Model \n",
