    "After debugging I understand at least some of the problem with Docket18-9526_Brief005.pdf. First of all, because some of the short headlines are repeated, and because for each headline when I search I am searching through the entire text line by line from the start, I'm coming up repeated hits on the same line. Then, because I sort the list of starting matches, the repeated headers get placed next to each other and that messes up my process to find the start and end of each section. This is because I'm relying on the end of the previous section to find my start. So first off, I need a way to avoid repeats. Also I should probably just not sort the list.\n"

The 1968 National \\nTrails System Act (\\u201cTrails Act\\u201d) designated the Appa-\\nlachian Trail as a national scenic trail to \\u201cbe adminis-tered primarily as a footpath by the Secretary of the Interior,\\u201d 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1244(a)(1), but did not \\u201ctransfer among Federal agencies any management responsibil-ities established under any other law for federally ad-\\nministered lands\\u201d traversed by a designated trail, id. \\n\\u00a7 1246(a)(1)(A). The Mineral Leasing Act (MLA), as amended in 1973, authorizes the \\u201cSecretary of the In-terior or appropriate agency head\\u201d to grant rights-of-way through any federal lands \\u201cfor pipeline purposes for the transportation of oil [and] natural gas.\\u201d 30 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 185(a). \\u201cFederal l ands\\u201d means \\u201call lands owned \\nby the United States except lands in the National Park System.\\u201d Id. \\u00a7 185(b)(1). The question presented is: \\n Whether the Forest Service has authority to grant \\nrights-of-way under the Mineral Leasing Act through lands traversed by the Appalachian Trail within na-tional forests. \\nii \\n \\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \\nPage \\n QUESTION PRESENTED...................................  i \\nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES .................................  iv INTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE  ......................  1 \\nBACKGROUND ...................................................  4 \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT ..............................  9 REASONS WHY THE PETITIONS SHOULD \\nBE GRANTED ..................................................  10 \\n I.

As approved by the Forest Service and FERC, \\nMVP would cross under the Trail footpath on the for-ested ridge marking the Virginia-West Virginia border, \\nwest of Roanoke, Virginia. The Forest Service required \\nMountain Valley to construct a 600-foot-long bore roughly 80 feet beneath the ridgetop and Trail. By \\nplacing the pipeline at this  depth, the Forest Service \\npreserved a football field- length (300-foot) forested \\nbuffer to each side of the Trail. Drilling equipment \\nwould temporarily be placed in pits downslope and not \\nvisible from the Trail. All construction-related impacts, \\n \\nworked for decades to obtain permanent protection for the en-\\ntirety of the Trail. However, th e uncertainty resulting from the \\nFourth Circuit\\u2019s decision regard ing agency jurisdiction has cre-\\nated a further obstacle to comple ting a land exchange that would \\nprotect the Trail while providing a right-of-way for MVP. \\n 9 See MVP FEIS \\u00a7 3.0; MVP ROD 23-27.  \\n5 \\n such as noise, would be temporary, and no construction \\nwould occur on the footpath.10 \\n The Forest Service and BLM were well on their \\nway to addressing the Fourth Circuit\\u2019s remand regard-\\ning MVP\\u2019s approvals to cross the Jefferson National \\nForest when the Fourth Circuit issued the decision be-low. Mountain Valley was not a party to that proceed-\\ning, but the decision had the same practical effect for \\nMVP as it did for Atlantic\\u2014no federal agency could lawfully issue an MLA right-of-way to either pipeline \\nto cross the Trail on national forest lands. \\n 2.  The Appalachian Trail was conceived by pri-\\nvate individuals and hiking clubs in the 1920s as a \\nfootpath from Maine to Georgia.\\n11 With the support of \\nthe Forest Service, the George Washington and Jeffer-\\nson national forests and six other national forests \\nalong the Appalachians have included segments of the \\nTrail since its beginning. The National Park Service \\n(\\u201cPark Service\\u201d) supported Trail construction in Shen-\\nandoah and Great Smoky Mountains national parks. \\n Groups of private volunteers, including numerous \\nhiking and outdoor recreation-oriented clubs along the eastern seaboard, took responsibility for construction \\n \\n 10 MVP ROD 27. \\n 11 See Nat\\u2019l Park Serv., U.S. Dep\\u2019t of the Interior, Trails for \\nAmerica: Report on the  Nationwide Trail Study 32-33 (1966) (\\u201c Trails \\nfor America \\u201d), https://www.nps.gov/noco /learn/management/upload/ \\ntrails-for-america-1966.pdf.  \\n6 \\n and maintenance of local trail segments.12 The Forest \\nService and the Park Service dedicated significant \\neffort to trail-building under various Depression-era \\npublic works programs.13 By the time the Trail was \\ncompleted in 1937, more than 700 miles of the 2,200-\\nmile footpath had been constructed on federal lands, \\nmostly national forests. The majority of the newly com-pleted Appalachian Trail, however, remained on pri-\\nvate or state lands.\\n14 \\n The Park Service and the Forest Service were both \\nproponents of the Trail throughout its construction \\nand worked cooperatively to ensure maintenance and protection of the Trail after its completion.\\n15 Despite \\nthe federal land managers\\u2019 important roles, most re-\\nsponsibility for trail management remained with the local trail clubs.\\n16 \\n \\n 12 Trails for America , 32-33; see generally  Appalachian Trail \\nConservancy, The Appalachian Trail: Celebrating America\\u2019s \\nHiking Trail  15-38 (2012). \\n 13 Sally K.

See Light v. United States , 220 U.S. 523, 536-\\n37 (1911) (upholding federal government\\u2019s authority to \\nestablish forest reserves a dministered by Secretary of \\nAgriculture). As this Court stated over a century ago, \\u201cit is not for the courts to say how\\u201d the national forests \\nand the nation\\u2019s public land s \\u201cshall be administered. \\nThat is for Congress to determine.\\u201d Id. \\n By holding that the Appalachian Trail segment \\ncrossed by Atlantic consists of \\u201clands in the National \\nPark System,\\u201d Pet. App. 55a, 57a (No. 18-1584), the \\nFourth Circuit not only misapplied the plain language \\nof the law, but also usurped Congress\\u2019s exclusive con-stitutional prerogative to allocate among federal de-\\npartments jurisdiction over federal lands. The Fourth \\nCircuit erroneously conflated the Trail-related coordi-nation and administrative role that Congress assigned \\nto the Secretary of the In terior\\u2014and which the Secre-\\ntary later delegated to the Park Service\\u2014with the comprehensive land management and jurisdictional \\nresponsibility Congress assigned to the Secretary of \\nAgriculture, acting through the Forest Service. \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision directly contradicts \\nthe Trails Act\\u2019s recognition that the federal agency ad-ministering the lands over which a national trail \\npasses may be different than the agency charged to \\n10 \\n administer that trail. It also contradicts Congress\\u2019s \\nWeeks Act mandate that th e national forest lands \\ncrossed by MVP and Atlantic would be \\u201cpermanently \\nreserved, held and administered as national forest ,\\u201d \\nnot national park , lands. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 521 (emphasis \\nadded). \\n The Forest Service and Park Service had for over \\n50 years prior to the circuit court\\u2019s decision consist-\\nently interpreted the Trails Act to not alter the Forest Service\\u2019s jurisdiction. Congre ss chose to promote inter-\\nagency and stakeholder coordination, but did so in a \\nway that maintained the Department of Agriculture\\u2019s jurisdiction. Congress never designated the strips of \\nnational forest lands used by  the Trail as national park \\nlands. Congress simply assigned to the Interior Secre-tary the responsibility to acquire lands and coordinate \\namong the government agencies and trail clubs in-\\nvolved in managing various Trail segments. \\n--------------------------------- \\uf0a8 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nREASONS WHY THE \\nPETITIONS SHOULD BE GRANTED  \\n Rather than applying the plain text of the Trails \\nAct, which would harmonize it with the Weeks Act, the Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision found conflict where there is \\nnone. The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s opinion usurps Congress\\u2019s \\nplenary Property Clause power and imposes a result that conflicts with a half-century of agency practice. \\nSee Pet. at 24-25 (No. 18-1587); Pet. at 19-21 (No. \\n18-1584). The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision contradicts \\n11 \\n the plain language of the W eeks Act and Trails Act and \\nCongress\\u2019s consistent record of careful, deliberate sys-\\ntematizing of departmental jurisdiction over public \\nlands. Congress has been especially deliberate when deciding how to assign jurisdiction over public forest \\nlands between national forests and national parks. Na-\\ntional forests are managed for utilitarian, \\u201cmultiple use\\u201d purposes. National parks are managed for preser-\\nvation. \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s erroneous interpretation, if \\nnot addressed by this Court, will create broad un-\\ncertainty over public l ands management and impose \\nsignificant risks on Atlantic, MVP, and existing and \\nplanned energy infrastructure well beyond the sites, \\nprojects, and parties involved here. The Mineral Leas-ing Act provides the principal federal authority for \\ngranting oil and gas pipeline rights-of-way on federal \\npublic lands. The Forest Service emphasizes correctly that the Trail-crossing issue is the only aspect of the \\ndecision below that cannot be addressed by further \\nagency analysis, factual review, public notice and com-ment, or clarification. See Pet. 13-14 (No. 18-1584). This \\ncritical point applies equally to MVP. If allowed to \\nstand, the decision below eliminates federal MLA au-thority to grant or renew rights-of-way for gas pipe-\\nlines serving the millions of  Americans living along the \\neastern seaboard if the pipeline crosses the Trail, a court-erected barrier from central Maine to north \\nGeorgia. \\n  \\n12 \\n I. The Appalachian Tr ail Segment Crossed \\nBy The ACP Project Is Not \\u201cLand In The \\nNational Park System\\u201d Under The Mineral Leasing Act. \\n The Forest Service used its management discre-\\ntion eight decades ago to approve and assist with con-\\nstruction of the footpath, sign s, and shelters on national \\nforest lands to help create the Appalachian Trail. But \\nit did not transfer the lands traversed by that footpath \\nto the Park Service. Neither did the Trails Act. \\n At times, the Park Service has characterized the \\nAppalachian Trail as a unit of the National Park Sys-tem for its internal labeling purposes. See, e.g., Pet. \\nApp. 55a (No. 18-1584). And so me segments of the Trail \\nare on lands inside national parks. But there is no ba-sis in the law for concluding that the entire 2,200-mile \\nfootpath has been transformed into \\u201clands in the Na-\\ntional Park System\\u201d by a label. See 54 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 100102, \\n100501. The term is a conven ient administrative catch-\\nall, evident in the fact that Park System \\u201cunits\\u201d often \\ninclude areas of non-federal ownership or areas under other agencies\\u2019 jurisdictions. The Trail corridor con-\\ntains a variety of areas administered by state and fed-\\neral agencies and local entities.\\n20 \\n The Trail at the locations to be crossed by Atlantic \\nand MVP is a congressional ov erlay of a trails system \\nuse and footpath on national forest land, but it does not \\nchange the character or juris diction of that land. The \\n \\n 20 Nat\\u2019l Parks Conservation Ass\\u2019n, Appalachian National \\nScenic Trail: A Special Report  3 (March 2010). \\n13 \\n place remains national forest land. The inter-agency \\nand stakeholder cooperation for the Trail coordinated \\nby the Secretary of the Interior is a procedural re-\\nquirement of the Trails Ac t, not a reallocation of \\nland management jurisdiction from the Department of \\nAgriculture to the Department of the Interior. \\n \\nA. Statutory Background. \\n1. The National Forest System. \\n In 1891, Congress authorized the President to \\u201cset \\napart and reserve . . . public land bearing forests . . . as \\npublic reservations.\\u201d Forest Reserve Act of 1891, ch. \\n561, \\u00a7 24, 26 Stat. 1103 (codif ied at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 471 \\n(repealed 1976)). In the Organic Administration Act \\nof 1897, Congress provided that \\u201c[n]o national forest \\nshall be established, except to improve and protect the forest within the boundaries, or for the purpose of \\nsecuring favorable conditions of water flows, and to \\nfurnish a continuous supply of timber.\\u201d Organic Ad-ministration Act of 1897, ch. 2, \\u00a7 1, 30 Stat. 34 (codi-\\nfied at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 475). In 1905, Congress transferred \\njurisdiction over the national forests from the Depart-ment of the Interior to the Department of Agriculture. \\nForest Transfer Act of 1905, ch. 288, \\u00a7 1, 33 Stat. 628 \\n(codified as amended at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 472). The Forest Transfer Act directs that \\u201cthe Department of Agricul-\\nture shall execute . . . all laws affecting public lands \\nheretofore or hereafter reserved\\u201d as forest reserves under the 1891 Act. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 472. These acts, ini-\\ntially focused on public lands in the western United \\n14 \\n States, established the foundation of the current na-\\ntional forest system. See 36 C.F.R. \\u00a7 200.3(b)(2). \\n The 1911 Weeks Act then authorized the Secretary \\nof Agriculture to acquire pri vate lands to establish na-\\ntional forests in the eastern United States. Act of Mar. \\n1, 1911, ch. 186, \\u00a7 9, 36 Stat. 962, \\u00a7 6 (codified at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 515).\\n21 Congress also directed that those lands \\nbe \\u201cpermanently reserved, held, and administered as \\nnational forest lands under the provisions of \\u201d the 1891 Act as supplemented. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 521; see also id . \\n\\u00a7 521a. Both the George Washington and Jefferson na-\\ntional forests were among th e first national forests es-\\ntablished pursuant to these authorities.\\n22 \\n From the beginning, national forests were to be \\nmanaged for \\u201cmultiple use,\\u201d diverse public purposes \\nincluding commercial activi ties such as timber har-\\nvest, mining, grazing, and energy development. See, \\ne.g., United States v. New Mexico , 438 U.S. 696, 706-09 \\n& n.18 (1978); United States v. Grimaud , 220 U.S. 506, \\n515 (1911); Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960, 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 528-531; Charles F. Wilkinson & H. \\n \\n 21 See also  Harold K. Steen, The U.S. Forest Service: A His-\\ntory 122-29 (1976) (history of the Weeks Act). \\n 22 See Proclamation No. 1448, 40 Stat. 1779 (1918) (estab-\\nlishing the Shenandoah National Forest); Exec. Order No. 5867 (June 28, 1932) (renaming the Shenandoah National Forest the George Washington National Forest); Proclamation No. 2165, 1 Fed. Reg. 227, 227-29 (Apr. 24, 1936) (establishing the Jefferson \\nNational Forest); see also  Forest Serv., U.S. Dep\\u2019t of Agric., George \\nWashington National Forest: A History  11, 15 (1993), https://www. \\nfs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOC UMENTS/stelprd3832787.pdf. \\n15 \\n Michael Anderson, Land and Resource Planning in the \\nNational Forests , 64 Or. L. Rev. 1, 20-23, 53-60 (1985). \\n Congress has adjusted the Forest Service\\u2019s mis-\\nsion over time, but the mission has always included the \\nresponsibility to use the agency\\u2019s wide discretion to \\nmake land and resource decisions that balance among various, often competing uses. When Congress decides \\nto require the Forest Service to depart from multiple-\\nuse principles in order to exclude forest lands from commercial uses, Congress does so by specific direc-\\ntion, for instance by designat ing that certain areas be \\nmanaged as national forest wilderness, including vari-ous locations that include the Trail footpath,\\n23 none of \\nwhich are crossed by Atlantic or MVP. \\n \\n2. The National Park System.  \\n Congress established the National Park System to \\npreserve, not develop, federal lands and resources. The \\nPark Service\\u2019s preservation mission is very different from the Forest Service\\u2019s utilitarian mission.\\n24 In 1916, \\n \\n 23 E.g., Act of Nov. 9, 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-471, 114 Stat. \\n2057 (designating the Priest Wilderness Area in Virginia); Act of Oct. 30, 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-586, 98 Stat. 3105 (designating the Thunder Ridge, Mountain Lake , Peters Mountain, Beartown, \\nLittle Wilson Creek, Lewis Fork, Priest Wilderness Areas in Virginia). \\n \\n24 See, e.g., Joseph L. Sax, Mountains Without Handrails, Re-\\nflections on the National Parks  5-9 (1980) (describing early history \\nand development of federal national parks policy); see generally  \\nJohn Ise, Our National Park Policy: A Critical History  185-95 \\n(1961) (history of national park policy during the period preceding and accompanying completion of the Appalachian Trail); Elmo R. \\n \\n16 \\n Congress provided that the \\u201cfundamental purposes of \\nthe said parks, monuments, and reservations . . . is to \\nconserve the scenery and the natural and historic ob-\\njects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same . . . unimpaired for the enjoy-\\nment of future generations.\\u201d Nat\\u2019l Park Serv. Organic \\nAct of 1916, ch. 408, \\u00a7 1, 39 Stat. 535 (codified as \\namended at 54 U.S.C. \\u00a7 100101). \\n National park lands are to be preserved and, where \\npossible, enjoyed. But for the national forests, Con-\\ngress has long emphasized t hat \\u201cthere must always be \\n. . . as primary objects and purposes the utilitarian use of land, of water, and of timber, as contributing to the \\nwealth of all the people.\\u201d H.R . Rep. No. 64-700, at 3 (1916). \\n \\n3. The National Trails System.  \\n The National Trails System Act seeks \\u201cto promote \\nthe preservation of, public a ccess to, travel within, and \\nenjoyment and appreciation of the open-air, outdoor areas and historic resources of the Nation.\\u201d 16 U.S.C. \\n\\u00a7 1241(a). The Trails Act authorized the creation of a \\nNational Trail System comprised of the national his-toric trails, national recreation trails, and national sce-\\nnic trails.

Id. \\u00a7 1244(a)(1). The Act delegated re-\\nsponsibility to coordinate administration of the Appa-\\nlachian Trail to the Secretary of the Interior and gave \\nthe Secretary of Agriculture equivalent responsibility for the Pacific Crest Trail. Congress did not change the \\njurisdictional status of the lands over which the trails \\ncross. As Professor Fairfax explained, \\u201c[i]rrespective of which Secretary has overa ll responsibility for a trail \\n[under the Trails Act], the Sec retary of the Interior is \\nin charge when a trail crosses Park or Bureau of Land Management lands and the Secr etary of Agriculture is \\nresponsible for management when a trail crosses For-\\nest Service land.\\u201d\\n25 \\n The Trails Act recognizes that a federal agency \\nother than the agency charged with the overall ad-ministration of a trail may have authority and re-\\nsponsibility for the administration of the lands  over \\nwhich the trail traverses. The latter retains its author-ity to administer those l ands despite the trail\\u2019s pres-\\nence. The statute is unambigu ous: \\u201cNothing . . . shall \\nbe deemed to transfer among Federal agencies any management responsibilities established under any \\nother law for federally admi nistered lands which are \\ncomponents of the National Trails System.\\u201d See 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 1246(a)(1)(A). \\n \\n \\n 25 Fairfax, Federal-State Cooperation , supra note 13, at 58; \\nsee also Cong.

When Congress Transfers Administrative \\nJurisdiction From The Agriculture De-\\npartment\\u2019s Forest Service And The Inte-\\nrior Department\\u2019s Park  Service, It Does \\nSo Explicitly. \\n The structure of the Trails  Act consistently reflects \\nCongress\\u2019s intent that federal agency land manage-\\nment jurisdiction be left undisturbed. The \\u201cSecretary \\ncharged with the administration of a national scenic . . . trail may relocate segments of a national scenic . . . \\ntrail right-of-way,\\u201d but only \\u201c with the concurrence of \\nthe head of the Federal agency having jurisdiction over the lands involved .\\u201d 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1246(b) (emphasis \\nadded). The Secretary \\u201cmay issue regulations,\\u201d but \\nonly \\u201c with the concurrence of the heads of any other \\nFederal agencies administering lands through which a \\n. . . national scenic . . . trail passes .\\u201d Id. \\u00a7 1246(i) (em-\\nphasis added). \\n Congress elsewhere consistently has been explicit \\nwhen it intends to transfe r jurisdiction from one fed-\\neral agency to ano ther. On the same day he signed the \\nTrails Act, President John son signed legislation es-\\ntablishing North Cascades National Park. That con-\\ntemporaneous legislation expressly transferred the \\nadministrative jurisdiction of lands from the national \\nforest system to the National Park System: \\nFederal property within the boundaries of the \\npark and recreation areas is hereby trans-ferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the \\nSecretary [of the Interior] for administration \\nby him as part of the park and recreation \\n19 \\n areas. The national forest land within such \\nboundaries is hereby eliminated from the na-\\ntional forests within which it was heretofore \\nlocated.  \\nAct of Jan. 15, 1968, Pub. L. No. 90-544, 82 Stat. 926 \\n(codified at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 90b(a)) (emphasis added).26 \\n Similarly, when establishing Great Basin National \\nPark some years later, Cong ress specified that \\u201c[l]ands \\nand waters . . . within the boundaries of the park which \\nwere administered by the Forest Service . . . prior to \\n[the date of enactment of this Act] are hereby trans-ferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secre-\\ntary [of the Interior].\\u201d 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 410mm-2; see also 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 192b-9 (boundary adjustments for Rocky Mountain National Park). \\n Two examples from the Appalachian Trail area \\nfurther demonstrate that when Congress puts land \\ninto a national park system unit, it says so. See 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 403k-1 (\\u201cSubject to valid existing rights, all lands within the boundaries of Great Smoky Moun-\\ntains National Park . . . hereafter shall be a part of the \\n \\n 26 In President Johnson\\u2019s remarks on signing the Trails Act, \\nhe stated that \\u201c[o]ur history of wise management of America\\u2019s na-tional forests has assisted us in designating the initial elements of the National Trails System. . . . : the Appalachian Trail and the \\nPacific Crest Trail.\\u201d Presidential Remarks Upon Signing Four Bills Relating to Conservation and Outdoor Recreation, 2 Pub. Papers 1000, 1001 (Oct. 2, 1968). H ad the Trails Act involved an \\nextensive jurisdictional transfer of national forest system land to the Park Service for the Appalachian Trail, it would have been unusual for the President to invoke the history of America\\u2019s na-\\ntional forest  management as an impetus for designating the Trail. \\n20 \\n national park and shall be subject to all laws, rules, \\nand regulations applicable to the national park.\\u201d); 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 403-3 (\\u201cSubject to valid existing rights, the \\nlands and interests in lands which comprise section 1-A of the Blue Ridge Parkway . . . are excluded from the \\nparkway, made a part of the Shenandoah National \\nPark, and shall be administer ed in accordance with the \\nAct of August 25, 1916 (39 Stat. 535; 16 U.S.C. 1-4).\\u201d). \\n Such jurisdictional transfer language is conspicu-\\nously absent from the Trails Act. Simply put, had Con-\\ngress intended to convert the Trail corridor lands into \\nlands of the National Park System, it would have said so. Any uncertainty over the significance of the absence \\nof transfer language should have been put to rest by \\nthe fact that the Trails Act lacks any of the other or-ganizational provisions that might reasonably be ex-\\npected to accompany a major change in allocation of \\nexecutive branch responsibilities across eight national forests in a fourteen-state region. The Trails Act makes \\nno mention of budget authority, personnel and prop-\\nerty reassignment, transition  schedule or process, re-\\nassignment of permits or easements. Indeed, the Trails \\nAct does not mention the Park Service except for the \\npurpose of maintaining a Trail map. See Whitman v. \\nAm. Trucking Ass\\u2019n , 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001) (\\u201cCon-\\ngress . . . does not alter the fundamental details of a \\nregulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provi-sions\\u2014it does not, one might say, hide elephants in \\nmouseholes.\\u201d). \\n Three other considerations strongly reinforce the \\nconclusion that the circuit court erred in interpreting \\n21 \\n the Trails Act. First , Congress had rejected at least \\neight proposals to transfer the national forests to the \\nInterior Department in the years preceding enactment \\nof the Trails Act, and it is highly unlikely that it would \\nhave transferred national forest lands sub silentio .27 \\nSecond , Congress has given significant consideration \\nto the question whether the relevant portions of the George Washington and Jefferson national forests \\ndeserved enhanced protection  from commercial develop-\\nment and has chosen not to do so, thus strongly indicat-ing that Congress would not have done indirectly by \\nimplication what it has de clined to do directly.\\n28 Third , \\n \\n 27 Ross W.

Roosevelt\\u2019s administration related to potential trans-fer of national forest jurisdiction away from the Agriculture De-partment). \\n \\n28 Congress has considered the question whether the sections \\nof the Trail corridor at issue here merit special protection by the Forest Service. Congress has designated numerous sections of \\nGeorge Washington and Jefferson national forest  lands crossed \\nby the Appalachian Trail as wilderness under the Wilderness Act \\n \\n22 \\n numerous major interstate gas pipelines crossed the \\nlands used for the Trail at the time Congress approved \\nthe Trails Act.29 The interstate pipelines were then, as \\ntoday, subject to federal approval under the provisions of the Natural Gas Act. Had Congress sought to change \\nthe federal approval process for gas pipelines inter-\\nsecting the path of the Trail, it would have said some-thing, especially if the in tended change amounted to a \\nprohibition of federal rights-of-way. \\n \\nII. The Circuit Court\\u2019s Holding Conflicts With \\nThis Court\\u2019s Decisions On Harmonizing Potentially Confli cting Statutes. \\n The Fourth Circuit was faced with reconciling the \\nTrails Act with the Weeks Act to determine the ap-\\nplicability of the Mineral Leasing Act. The court mis-characterized the Trails Act in a way that presented an \\napparent conflict with the Weeks Act, which in turn vi-\\ntiated the Mineral Leasing Act. The court made no \\n \\nof 1964, 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1131-1136. See, e.g., Act of Oct. 30, 1984, \\nPub. L. No. 98-586, 98 Stat. 3105 (designating the Thunder Ridge, Mountain Lake, Peters Mountain, Beartown, Little Wilson Creek, \\nLewis Fork, Priest Wi lderness Areas in Virg inia). Congress has \\nnever found that the national forest lands proposed to be used for the Atlantic or MVP below-grade Trail crossings warrant wilder-ness protection. \\n \\n29 A 1968 map prepared by the Federal Power Commission, \\nFERC\\u2019s predecessor agency charged with implementation of the Natural Gas Act, shows multiple major gas pipelines in the area \\nof the Trail. That map is included as Attachment A. Attachment B shows the approximate route of the Trail superimposed on the map by amicus  Mountain Valley using contemporary geographic \\ninformation system data for the Trail\\u2019s current route. \\n23 \\n effort to interpret the Weeks Act in concert with the \\nTrails Act. By failing to even try to reconcile and har-\\nmonize the statutes, the Fourth Circuit transformed \\n\\u201cfrom expounder[ ] of what the law is into policy-\\nmaker[ ] choosing what the law should be .\\u201d Epic Sys. \\nCorp. v. Lewis , 138 S. Ct. 1612, 1624 (2018). \\n When \\u201cconfronted with two Acts of Congress alleg-\\nedly touching on the same topic, this Court is not at \\n\\u2018liberty to pick and choose among congressional enact-ments\\u2019 and must instead strive \\u2018to give effect to both.\\u2019 \\u201d \\nId. (quoting Morton v. Mancari , 417 U.S. 535, 551 \\n(1974)). The project challengers below bore a \\u201cheavy burden\\u201d\\u2014that was never met or even considered by \\nthe circuit court\\u2014to show that Congress implicitly dis-\\nplaced the controlling national forest-administration statutes through the 1968 Trails Act. See id . \\n The circuit court simply presumed  that the entire \\nalmost 2,200-mile long Trail corridor is land in the \\n\\u201cNational Park System\\u201d because the Trail was generi-\\ncally referenced in the record as a \\u201c \\u2018unit\\u2019 of the Na-tional Park System.\\u201d Pet. App. 55a (No. 18-1584). But \\na shorthand labeling reference, useful to agency staff \\nresponding to an internal Interior Department delega-tion of responsibility to implement the Trails Act, does \\nnot itself transfer administration of all lands within \\nthe Trail corridor to the Park Service, change the language of the Trails Act, or even modify the Park \\nService\\u2019s own longstanding administrative interpreta-\\ntion, application, and understanding of the Trails Act as reflected in the agency\\u2019s management documents \\nand consistent practice. See FCC v. Fox TV Stations , \\n24 \\n 556 U.S. 502, 513-16 (2009); see also  Pet. at 24-25 (No. \\n18-1587); Pet. at 19-21 (No. 18-1584). \\n The circuit court\\u2019s approach results in an implau-\\nsible reading of the Trails Act. Extending the Fourth \\nCircuit\\u2019s reasoning to other national scenic trails, such \\nas the Continental Divide Trail, where the Trails Act assigns to the Secretary of Agriculture the trail-admin-\\nistration role, see 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1244(a)(5), would convert \\nnarrow strips of Yellowstone, Glacier, and Rocky Moun-tain national parks into national forests without any \\ncongressional action. The same would hold true for the \\nfive other national scenic or historic trails adminis-tered by the Forest Service, many of which also trav-\\nerse national park system lands.\\n30 Numerous other \\nnational scenic and historic trails are administered by \\nthe Park Service. The circuit court\\u2019s decision, if applied \\nand followed nationwide, woul d elevate all those trails, \\n42,127 miles in all, to \\u201cland in the National Park Sys-tem.\\u201d\\n31 \\n--------------------------------- \\uf0a8 ---------------------------------  \\n \\n \\n 30 Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, Florida National Sce-\\nnic Trail, Nez Perce National Historic Trail, Arizona National Scenic Trail, and Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1244(a)(2), (13), (14), (27), (30). \\n \\n31 National Historic Trails , Nat\\u2019l Park Serv., https://www.nps. \\ngov/subjects/nationaltrailssystem/n ational-historic-trails.htm (last \\nvisited July 18, 2019).

Id. \\n25 \\n CONCLUSION \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision is inconsistent with \\nthe legal framework of the Trails Act, the national for-est statutes, and the Mineral Leasing Act. It is incon-\\nsistent with the established agency practice of over 50 \\nyears recognizing that\\u2014as between the Forest Service and Park Service\\u2014each agency administers its own \\nlands over which the Trail traverses. If there is to be \\nan alteration of the prior congressional dedication of the management and jurisdict ion of those national for-\\nests, that is for Congress\\u2014and not the courts\\u2014to de-\\ntermine. \\n Left unaddressed, the circuit court\\u2019s decision will \\nhave significant adverse consequences, not only for At-lantic and MVP, but also fo r future critical infrastruc-\\nture. Certiorari should be granted to clarify the status \\nof the national forest system lands traversed by the Appalachian National Scenic Trail and to remove the \\nbarriers to Trail-crossing authorizations imposed by \\nthe Fourth Circuit. \\nRespectfully submitted, \\nM\\nURRAY  D.

As approved by the Forest Service and FERC, \\nMVP would cross under the Trail footpath on the for-ested ridge marking the Virginia-West Virginia border, \\nwest of Roanoke, Virginia. The Forest Service required \\nMountain Valley to construct a 600-foot-long bore roughly 80 feet beneath the ridgetop and Trail. By \\nplacing the pipeline at this  depth, the Forest Service \\npreserved a football field- length (300-foot) forested \\nbuffer to each side of the Trail. Drilling equipment \\nwould temporarily be placed in pits downslope and not \\nvisible from the Trail. All construction-related impacts, \\n \\nworked for decades to obtain permanent protection for the en-\\ntirety of the Trail. However, th e uncertainty resulting from the \\nFourth Circuit\\u2019s decision regard ing agency jurisdiction has cre-\\nated a further obstacle to comple ting a land exchange that would \\nprotect the Trail while providing a right-of-way for MVP. \\n 9 See MVP FEIS \\u00a7 3.0; MVP ROD 23-27.  \\n5 \\n such as noise, would be temporary, and no construction \\nwould occur on the footpath.10 \\n The Forest Service and BLM were well on their \\nway to addressing the Fourth Circuit\\u2019s remand regard-\\ning MVP\\u2019s approvals to cross the Jefferson National \\nForest when the Fourth Circuit issued the decision be-low. Mountain Valley was not a party to that proceed-\\ning, but the decision had the same practical effect for \\nMVP as it did for Atlantic\\u2014no federal agency could lawfully issue an MLA right-of-way to either pipeline \\nto cross the Trail on national forest lands. \\n 2.  The Appalachian Trail was conceived by pri-\\nvate individuals and hiking clubs in the 1920s as a \\nfootpath from Maine to Georgia.\\n11 With the support of \\nthe Forest Service, the George Washington and Jeffer-\\nson national forests and six other national forests \\nalong the Appalachians have included segments of the \\nTrail since its beginning. The National Park Service \\n(\\u201cPark Service\\u201d) supported Trail construction in Shen-\\nandoah and Great Smoky Mountains national parks. \\n Groups of private volunteers, including numerous \\nhiking and outdoor recreation-oriented clubs along the eastern seaboard, took responsibility for construction \\n \\n 10 MVP ROD 27. \\n 11 See Nat\\u2019l Park Serv., U.S. Dep\\u2019t of the Interior, Trails for \\nAmerica: Report on the  Nationwide Trail Study 32-33 (1966) (\\u201c Trails \\nfor America \\u201d), https://www.nps.gov/noco /learn/management/upload/ \\ntrails-for-america-1966.pdf.  \\n6 \\n and maintenance of local trail segments.12 The Forest \\nService and the Park Service dedicated significant \\neffort to trail-building under various Depression-era \\npublic works programs.13 By the time the Trail was \\ncompleted in 1937, more than 700 miles of the 2,200-\\nmile footpath had been constructed on federal lands, \\nmostly national forests. The majority of the newly com-pleted Appalachian Trail, however, remained on pri-\\nvate or state lands.\\n14 \\n The Park Service and the Forest Service were both \\nproponents of the Trail throughout its construction \\nand worked cooperatively to ensure maintenance and protection of the Trail after its completion.\\n15 Despite \\nthe federal land managers\\u2019 important roles, most re-\\nsponsibility for trail management remained with the local trail clubs.\\n16 \\n \\n 12 Trails for America , 32-33; see generally  Appalachian Trail \\nConservancy, The Appalachian Trail: Celebrating America\\u2019s \\nHiking Trail  15-38 (2012). \\n 13 Sally K.

See Light v. United States , 220 U.S. 523, 536-\\n37 (1911) (upholding federal government\\u2019s authority to \\nestablish forest reserves a dministered by Secretary of \\nAgriculture). As this Court stated over a century ago, \\u201cit is not for the courts to say how\\u201d the national forests \\nand the nation\\u2019s public land s \\u201cshall be administered. \\nThat is for Congress to determine.\\u201d Id. \\n By holding that the Appalachian Trail segment \\ncrossed by Atlantic consists of \\u201clands in the National \\nPark System,\\u201d Pet. App. 55a, 57a (No. 18-1584), the \\nFourth Circuit not only misapplied the plain language \\nof the law, but also usurped Congress\\u2019s exclusive con-stitutional prerogative to allocate among federal de-\\npartments jurisdiction over federal lands. The Fourth \\nCircuit erroneously conflated the Trail-related coordi-nation and administrative role that Congress assigned \\nto the Secretary of the In terior\\u2014and which the Secre-\\ntary later delegated to the Park Service\\u2014with the comprehensive land management and jurisdictional \\nresponsibility Congress assigned to the Secretary of \\nAgriculture, acting through the Forest Service. \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision directly contradicts \\nthe Trails Act\\u2019s recognition that the federal agency ad-ministering the lands over which a national trail \\npasses may be different than the agency charged to \\n10 \\n administer that trail. It also contradicts Congress\\u2019s \\nWeeks Act mandate that th e national forest lands \\ncrossed by MVP and Atlantic would be \\u201cpermanently \\nreserved, held and administered as national forest ,\\u201d \\nnot national park , lands. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 521 (emphasis \\nadded). \\n The Forest Service and Park Service had for over \\n50 years prior to the circuit court\\u2019s decision consist-\\nently interpreted the Trails Act to not alter the Forest Service\\u2019s jurisdiction. Congre ss chose to promote inter-\\nagency and stakeholder coordination, but did so in a \\nway that maintained the Department of Agriculture\\u2019s jurisdiction. Congress never designated the strips of \\nnational forest lands used by  the Trail as national park \\nlands. Congress simply assigned to the Interior Secre-tary the responsibility to acquire lands and coordinate \\namong the government agencies and trail clubs in-\\nvolved in managing various Trail segments. \\n--------------------------------- \\uf0a8 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nREASONS WHY THE \\nPETITIONS SHOULD BE GRANTED  \\n Rather than applying the plain text of the Trails \\nAct, which would harmonize it with the Weeks Act, the Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision found conflict where there is \\nnone. The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s opinion usurps Congress\\u2019s \\nplenary Property Clause power and imposes a result that conflicts with a half-century of agency practice. \\nSee Pet. at 24-25 (No. 18-1587); Pet. at 19-21 (No. \\n18-1584). The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision contradicts \\n11 \\n the plain language of the W eeks Act and Trails Act and \\nCongress\\u2019s consistent record of careful, deliberate sys-\\ntematizing of departmental jurisdiction over public \\nlands. Congress has been especially deliberate when deciding how to assign jurisdiction over public forest \\nlands between national forests and national parks. Na-\\ntional forests are managed for utilitarian, \\u201cmultiple use\\u201d purposes. National parks are managed for preser-\\nvation. \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s erroneous interpretation, if \\nnot addressed by this Court, will create broad un-\\ncertainty over public l ands management and impose \\nsignificant risks on Atlantic, MVP, and existing and \\nplanned energy infrastructure well beyond the sites, \\nprojects, and parties involved here. The Mineral Leas-ing Act provides the principal federal authority for \\ngranting oil and gas pipeline rights-of-way on federal \\npublic lands. The Forest Service emphasizes correctly that the Trail-crossing issue is the only aspect of the \\ndecision below that cannot be addressed by further \\nagency analysis, factual review, public notice and com-ment, or clarification. See Pet. 13-14 (No. 18-1584). This \\ncritical point applies equally to MVP. If allowed to \\nstand, the decision below eliminates federal MLA au-thority to grant or renew rights-of-way for gas pipe-\\nlines serving the millions of  Americans living along the \\neastern seaboard if the pipeline crosses the Trail, a court-erected barrier from central Maine to north \\nGeorgia. \\n  \\n12 \\n I. The Appalachian Tr ail Segment Crossed \\nBy The ACP Project Is Not \\u201cLand In The \\nNational Park System\\u201d Under The Mineral Leasing Act. \\n The Forest Service used its management discre-\\ntion eight decades ago to approve and assist with con-\\nstruction of the footpath, sign s, and shelters on national \\nforest lands to help create the Appalachian Trail. But \\nit did not transfer the lands traversed by that footpath \\nto the Park Service. Neither did the Trails Act. \\n At times, the Park Service has characterized the \\nAppalachian Trail as a unit of the National Park Sys-tem for its internal labeling purposes. See, e.g., Pet. \\nApp. 55a (No. 18-1584). And so me segments of the Trail \\nare on lands inside national parks. But there is no ba-sis in the law for concluding that the entire 2,200-mile \\nfootpath has been transformed into \\u201clands in the Na-\\ntional Park System\\u201d by a label. See 54 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 100102, \\n100501. The term is a conven ient administrative catch-\\nall, evident in the fact that Park System \\u201cunits\\u201d often \\ninclude areas of non-federal ownership or areas under other agencies\\u2019 jurisdictions. The Trail corridor con-\\ntains a variety of areas administered by state and fed-\\neral agencies and local entities.\\n20 \\n The Trail at the locations to be crossed by Atlantic \\nand MVP is a congressional ov erlay of a trails system \\nuse and footpath on national forest land, but it does not \\nchange the character or juris diction of that land. The \\n \\n 20 Nat\\u2019l Parks Conservation Ass\\u2019n, Appalachian National \\nScenic Trail: A Special Report  3 (March 2010). \\n13 \\n place remains national forest land. The inter-agency \\nand stakeholder cooperation for the Trail coordinated \\nby the Secretary of the Interior is a procedural re-\\nquirement of the Trails Ac t, not a reallocation of \\nland management jurisdiction from the Department of \\nAgriculture to the Department of the Interior. \\n \\nA. Statutory Background. \\n1. The National Forest System. \\n In 1891, Congress authorized the President to \\u201cset \\napart and reserve . . . public land bearing forests . . . as \\npublic reservations.\\u201d Forest Reserve Act of 1891, ch. \\n561, \\u00a7 24, 26 Stat. 1103 (codif ied at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 471 \\n(repealed 1976)). In the Organic Administration Act \\nof 1897, Congress provided that \\u201c[n]o national forest \\nshall be established, except to improve and protect the forest within the boundaries, or for the purpose of \\nsecuring favorable conditions of water flows, and to \\nfurnish a continuous supply of timber.\\u201d Organic Ad-ministration Act of 1897, ch. 2, \\u00a7 1, 30 Stat. 34 (codi-\\nfied at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 475). In 1905, Congress transferred \\njurisdiction over the national forests from the Depart-ment of the Interior to the Department of Agriculture. \\nForest Transfer Act of 1905, ch. 288, \\u00a7 1, 33 Stat. 628 \\n(codified as amended at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 472). The Forest Transfer Act directs that \\u201cthe Department of Agricul-\\nture shall execute . . . all laws affecting public lands \\nheretofore or hereafter reserved\\u201d as forest reserves under the 1891 Act. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 472. These acts, ini-\\ntially focused on public lands in the western United \\n14 \\n States, established the foundation of the current na-\\ntional forest system. See 36 C.F.R. \\u00a7 200.3(b)(2). \\n The 1911 Weeks Act then authorized the Secretary \\nof Agriculture to acquire pri vate lands to establish na-\\ntional forests in the eastern United States. Act of Mar. \\n1, 1911, ch. 186, \\u00a7 9, 36 Stat. 962, \\u00a7 6 (codified at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 515).\\n21 Congress also directed that those lands \\nbe \\u201cpermanently reserved, held, and administered as \\nnational forest lands under the provisions of \\u201d the 1891 Act as supplemented. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 521; see also id . \\n\\u00a7 521a. Both the George Washington and Jefferson na-\\ntional forests were among th e first national forests es-\\ntablished pursuant to these authorities.\\n22 \\n From the beginning, national forests were to be \\nmanaged for \\u201cmultiple use,\\u201d diverse public purposes \\nincluding commercial activi ties such as timber har-\\nvest, mining, grazing, and energy development. See, \\ne.g., United States v. New Mexico , 438 U.S. 696, 706-09 \\n& n.18 (1978); United States v.

Order No. 5867 (June 28, 1932) (renaming the Shenandoah National Forest the George Washington National Forest); Proclamation No. 2165, 1 Fed.

L. Rev. 1, 20-23, 53-60 (1985). \\n Congress has adjusted the Forest Service\\u2019s mis-\\nsion over time, but the mission has always included the \\nresponsibility to use the agency\\u2019s wide discretion to \\nmake land and resource decisions that balance among various, often competing uses. When Congress decides \\nto require the Forest Service to depart from multiple-\\nuse principles in order to exclude forest lands from commercial uses, Congress does so by specific direc-\\ntion, for instance by designat ing that certain areas be \\nmanaged as national forest wilderness, including vari-ous locations that include the Trail footpath,\\n23 none of \\nwhich are crossed by Atlantic or MVP. \\n \\n2. The National Park System.  \\n Congress established the National Park System to \\npreserve, not develop, federal lands and resources. The \\nPark Service\\u2019s preservation mission is very different from the Forest Service\\u2019s utilitarian mission.\\n24 In 1916, \\n \\n 23 E.g., Act of Nov. 9, 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-471, 114 Stat. \\n2057 (designating the Priest Wilderness Area in Virginia); Act of Oct. 30, 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-586, 98 Stat. 3105 (designating the Thunder Ridge, Mountain Lake , Peters Mountain, Beartown, \\nLittle Wilson Creek, Lewis Fork, Priest Wilderness Areas in Virginia). \\n \\n24 See, e.g., Joseph L. Sax, Mountains Without Handrails, Re-\\nflections on the National Parks  5-9 (1980) (describing early history \\nand development of federal national parks policy); see generally  \\nJohn Ise, Our National Park Policy: A Critical History  185-95 \\n(1961) (history of national park policy during the period preceding and accompanying completion of the Appalachian Trail); Elmo R. \\n \\n16 \\n Congress provided that the \\u201cfundamental purposes of \\nthe said parks, monuments, and reservations . . . is to \\nconserve the scenery and the natural and historic ob-\\njects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same . . . unimpaired for the enjoy-\\nment of future generations.\\u201d Nat\\u2019l Park Serv. Organic \\nAct of 1916, ch. 408, \\u00a7 1, 39 Stat. 535 (codified as \\namended at 54 U.S.C. \\u00a7 100101). \\n National park lands are to be preserved and, where \\npossible, enjoyed. But for the national forests, Con-\\ngress has long emphasized t hat \\u201cthere must always be \\n. . . as primary objects and purposes the utilitarian use of land, of water, and of timber, as contributing to the \\nwealth of all the people.\\u201d H.R . Rep. No. 64-700, at 3 (1916). \\n \\n3. The National Trails System.  \\n The National Trails System Act seeks \\u201cto promote \\nthe preservation of, public a ccess to, travel within, and \\nenjoyment and appreciation of the open-air, outdoor areas and historic resources of the Nation.\\u201d 16 U.S.C. \\n\\u00a7 1241(a). The Trails Act authorized the creation of a \\nNational Trail System comprised of the national his-toric trails, national recreation trails, and national sce-\\nnic trails. Id. \\u00a7 1242(a). \\n The Trails Act designated the Appalachian Trail \\nand the Pacific Crest Trail as  the nation\\u2019s first national \\n \\nRichardson, The Politics of Conservation: Crusades and Contro-\\nversies 1897-1913 , at 22-46 (1962) (history of formative public pol-\\nicy debates over assignment of departmental authority over federal forest lands). \\n17 \\n scenic trails. Id. \\u00a7 1244(a)(1). The Act delegated re-\\nsponsibility to coordinate administration of the Appa-\\nlachian Trail to the Secretary of the Interior and gave \\nthe Secretary of Agriculture equivalent responsibility for the Pacific Crest Trail. Congress did not change the \\njurisdictional status of the lands over which the trails \\ncross. As Professor Fairfax explained, \\u201c[i]rrespective of which Secretary has overa ll responsibility for a trail \\n[under the Trails Act], the Sec retary of the Interior is \\nin charge when a trail crosses Park or Bureau of Land Management lands and the Secr etary of Agriculture is \\nresponsible for management when a trail crosses For-\\nest Service land.\\u201d\\n25 \\n The Trails Act recognizes that a federal agency \\nother than the agency charged with the overall ad-ministration of a trail may have authority and re-\\nsponsibility for the administration of the lands  over \\nwhich the trail traverses. The latter retains its author-ity to administer those l ands despite the trail\\u2019s pres-\\nence. The statute is unambigu ous: \\u201cNothing . . . shall \\nbe deemed to transfer among Federal agencies any management responsibilities established under any \\nother law for federally admi nistered lands which are \\ncomponents of the National Trails System.\\u201d See 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 1246(a)(1)(A). \\n \\n \\n 25 Fairfax, Federal-State Cooperation , supra note 13, at 58; \\nsee also Cong. Research Serv., R43868, The National Trails Sys-\\ntem: A Brief Overview  6-7 (2015). \\n18 \\n B. When Congress Transfers Administrative \\nJurisdiction From The Agriculture De-\\npartment\\u2019s Forest Service And The Inte-\\nrior Department\\u2019s Park  Service, It Does \\nSo Explicitly. \\n The structure of the Trails  Act consistently reflects \\nCongress\\u2019s intent that federal agency land manage-\\nment jurisdiction be left undisturbed. The \\u201cSecretary \\ncharged with the administration of a national scenic . . . trail may relocate segments of a national scenic . . . \\ntrail right-of-way,\\u201d but only \\u201c with the concurrence of \\nthe head of the Federal agency having jurisdiction over the lands involved .\\u201d 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1246(b) (emphasis \\nadded). The Secretary \\u201cmay issue regulations,\\u201d but \\nonly \\u201c with the concurrence of the heads of any other \\nFederal agencies administering lands through which a \\n. . . national scenic . . . trail passes .\\u201d Id. \\u00a7 1246(i) (em-\\nphasis added). \\n Congress elsewhere consistently has been explicit \\nwhen it intends to transfe r jurisdiction from one fed-\\neral agency to ano ther. On the same day he signed the \\nTrails Act, President John son signed legislation es-\\ntablishing North Cascades National Park. That con-\\ntemporaneous legislation expressly transferred the \\nadministrative jurisdiction of lands from the national \\nforest system to the National Park System: \\nFederal property within the boundaries of the \\npark and recreation areas is hereby trans-ferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the \\nSecretary [of the Interior] for administration \\nby him as part of the park and recreation \\n19 \\n areas. The national forest land within such \\nboundaries is hereby eliminated from the na-\\ntional forests within which it was heretofore \\nlocated.  \\nAct of Jan. 15, 1968, Pub. L. No. 90-544, 82 Stat. 926 \\n(codified at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 90b(a)) (emphasis added).26 \\n Similarly, when establishing Great Basin National \\nPark some years later, Cong ress specified that \\u201c[l]ands \\nand waters . . . within the boundaries of the park which \\nwere administered by the Forest Service . . . prior to \\n[the date of enactment of this Act] are hereby trans-ferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secre-\\ntary [of the Interior].\\u201d 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 410mm-2; see also 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 192b-9 (boundary adjustments for Rocky Mountain National Park). \\n Two examples from the Appalachian Trail area \\nfurther demonstrate that when Congress puts land \\ninto a national park system unit, it says so. See 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 403k-1 (\\u201cSubject to valid existing rights, all lands within the boundaries of Great Smoky Moun-\\ntains National Park . . . hereafter shall be a part of the \\n \\n 26 In President Johnson\\u2019s remarks on signing the Trails Act, \\nhe stated that \\u201c[o]ur history of wise management of America\\u2019s na-tional forests has assisted us in designating the initial elements of the National Trails System. . . . : the Appalachian Trail and the \\nPacific Crest Trail.\\u201d Presidential Remarks Upon Signing Four Bills Relating to Conservation and Outdoor Recreation, 2 Pub. Papers 1000, 1001 (Oct. 2, 1968). H ad the Trails Act involved an \\nextensive jurisdictional transfer of national forest system land to the Park Service for the Appalachian Trail, it would have been unusual for the President to invoke the history of America\\u2019s na-\\ntional forest  management as an impetus for designating the Trail. \\n20 \\n national park and shall be subject to all laws, rules, \\nand regulations applicable to the national park.\\u201d); 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 403-3 (\\u201cSubject to valid existing rights, the \\nlands and interests in lands which comprise section 1-A of the Blue Ridge Parkway . . . are excluded from the \\nparkway, made a part of the Shenandoah National \\nPark, and shall be administer ed in accordance with the \\nAct of August 25, 1916 (39 Stat. 535; 16 U.S.C. 1-4).\\u201d). \\n Such jurisdictional transfer language is conspicu-\\nously absent from the Trails Act. Simply put, had Con-\\ngress intended to convert the Trail corridor lands into \\nlands of the National Park System, it would have said so. Any uncertainty over the significance of the absence \\nof transfer language should have been put to rest by \\nthe fact that the Trails Act lacks any of the other or-ganizational provisions that might reasonably be ex-\\npected to accompany a major change in allocation of \\nexecutive branch responsibilities across eight national forests in a fourteen-state region. The Trails Act makes \\nno mention of budget authority, personnel and prop-\\nerty reassignment, transition  schedule or process, re-\\nassignment of permits or easements. Indeed, the Trails \\nAct does not mention the Park Service except for the \\npurpose of maintaining a Trail map. See Whitman v. \\nAm. Trucking Ass\\u2019n , 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001) (\\u201cCon-\\ngress . . . does not alter the fundamental details of a \\nregulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provi-sions\\u2014it does not, one might say, hide elephants in \\nmouseholes.\\u201d). \\n Three other considerations strongly reinforce the \\nconclusion that the circuit court erred in interpreting \\n21 \\n the Trails Act. First , Congress had rejected at least \\neight proposals to transfer the national forests to the \\nInterior Department in the years preceding enactment \\nof the Trails Act, and it is highly unlikely that it would \\nhave transferred national forest lands sub silentio .27 \\nSecond , Congress has given significant consideration \\nto the question whether the relevant portions of the George Washington and Jefferson national forests \\ndeserved enhanced protection  from commercial develop-\\nment and has chosen not to do so, thus strongly indicat-ing that Congress would not have done indirectly by \\nimplication what it has de clined to do directly.\\n28 Third , \\n \\n 27 Ross W. Gorte, Cong. Research Serv., RL34772, Proposals \\nto Merge the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management: Issues and Approaches  CRS-14 (2008) (\\u201cProposals to transfer the \\nFS to DOI or the BLM to USDA, or to merge the FS and BLM (or \\nits predecessor), date back to 1911, and have been made under Presidents Taft, Harding, Hoover, Roosevelt, Truman, Eisen-hower, Nixon, Carter, and Clinto n. In an attempt to improve ad-\\nministration of the federal lands, President Reagan proposed a substantial exchange (consolidation) of lands and personnel be-tween the agencies, but even this more limited reorganization was prevented by Cong ress.\\u201d); U.S. Gov\\u2019t Accountability Off., \\nGAO-09-223, Federal Land Management: Observations on a Pos-\\nsible Move of the Forest Service in to the Department of the Interior  \\n56-61 (2009); see also  T.H.

Roosevelt\\u2019s administration related to potential trans-fer of national forest jurisdiction away from the Agriculture De-partment). \\n \\n28 Congress has considered the question whether the sections \\nof the Trail corridor at issue here merit special protection by the Forest Service. Congress has designated numerous sections of \\nGeorge Washington and Jefferson national forest  lands crossed \\nby the Appalachian Trail as wilderness under the Wilderness Act \\n \\n22 \\n numerous major interstate gas pipelines crossed the \\nlands used for the Trail at the time Congress approved \\nthe Trails Act.29 The interstate pipelines were then, as \\ntoday, subject to federal approval under the provisions of the Natural Gas Act. Had Congress sought to change \\nthe federal approval process for gas pipelines inter-\\nsecting the path of the Trail, it would have said some-thing, especially if the in tended change amounted to a \\nprohibition of federal rights-of-way. \\n \\nII. The Circuit Court\\u2019s Holding Conflicts With \\nThis Court\\u2019s Decisions On Harmonizing Potentially Confli cting Statutes. \\n The Fourth Circuit was faced with reconciling the \\nTrails Act with the Weeks Act to determine the ap-\\nplicability of the Mineral Leasing Act. The court mis-characterized the Trails Act in a way that presented an \\napparent conflict with the Weeks Act, which in turn vi-\\ntiated the Mineral Leasing Act. The court made no \\n \\nof 1964, 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1131-1136. See, e.g., Act of Oct. 30, 1984, \\nPub. L. No. 98-586, 98 Stat. 3105 (designating the Thunder Ridge, Mountain Lake, Peters Mountain, Beartown, Little Wilson Creek, \\nLewis Fork, Priest Wi lderness Areas in Virg inia). Congress has \\nnever found that the national forest lands proposed to be used for the Atlantic or MVP below-grade Trail crossings warrant wilder-ness protection. \\n \\n29 A 1968 map prepared by the Federal Power Commission, \\nFERC\\u2019s predecessor agency charged with implementation of the Natural Gas Act, shows multiple major gas pipelines in the area \\nof the Trail. That map is included as Attachment A. Attachment B shows the approximate route of the Trail superimposed on the map by amicus  Mountain Valley using contemporary geographic \\ninformation system data for the Trail\\u2019s current route. \\n23 \\n effort to interpret the Weeks Act in concert with the \\nTrails Act. By failing to even try to reconcile and har-\\nmonize the statutes, the Fourth Circuit transformed \\n\\u201cfrom expounder[ ] of what the law is into policy-\\nmaker[ ] choosing what the law should be .\\u201d Epic Sys. \\nCorp. v. Lewis , 138 S. Ct. 1612, 1624 (2018). \\n When \\u201cconfronted with two Acts of Congress alleg-\\nedly touching on the same topic, this Court is not at \\n\\u2018liberty to pick and choose among congressional enact-ments\\u2019 and must instead strive \\u2018to give effect to both.\\u2019 \\u201d \\nId. (quoting Morton v. Mancari , 417 U.S. 535, 551 \\n(1974)). The project challengers below bore a \\u201cheavy burden\\u201d\\u2014that was never met or even considered by \\nthe circuit court\\u2014to show that Congress implicitly dis-\\nplaced the controlling national forest-administration statutes through the 1968 Trails Act. See id . \\n The circuit court simply presumed  that the entire \\nalmost 2,200-mile long Trail corridor is land in the \\n\\u201cNational Park System\\u201d because the Trail was generi-\\ncally referenced in the record as a \\u201c \\u2018unit\\u2019 of the Na-tional Park System.\\u201d Pet. App. 55a (No. 18-1584). But \\na shorthand labeling reference, useful to agency staff \\nresponding to an internal Interior Department delega-tion of responsibility to implement the Trails Act, does \\nnot itself transfer administration of all lands within \\nthe Trail corridor to the Park Service, change the language of the Trails Act, or even modify the Park \\nService\\u2019s own longstanding administrative interpreta-\\ntion, application, and understanding of the Trails Act as reflected in the agency\\u2019s management documents \\nand consistent practice. See FCC v. Fox TV Stations , \\n24 \\n 556 U.S. 502, 513-16 (2009); see also  Pet. at 24-25 (No. \\n18-1587); Pet. at 19-21 (No. 18-1584). \\n The circuit court\\u2019s approach results in an implau-\\nsible reading of the Trails Act. Extending the Fourth \\nCircuit\\u2019s reasoning to other national scenic trails, such \\nas the Continental Divide Trail, where the Trails Act assigns to the Secretary of Agriculture the trail-admin-\\nistration role, see 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1244(a)(5), would convert \\nnarrow strips of Yellowstone, Glacier, and Rocky Moun-tain national parks into national forests without any \\ncongressional action. The same would hold true for the \\nfive other national scenic or historic trails adminis-tered by the Forest Service, many of which also trav-\\nerse national park system lands.\\n30 Numerous other \\nnational scenic and historic trails are administered by \\nthe Park Service. The circuit court\\u2019s decision, if applied \\nand followed nationwide, woul d elevate all those trails, \\n42,127 miles in all, to \\u201cland in the National Park Sys-tem.\\u201d\\n31 \\n--------------------------------- \\uf0a8 ---------------------------------  \\n \\n \\n 30 Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, Florida National Sce-\\nnic Trail, Nez Perce National Historic Trail, Arizona National Scenic Trail, and Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1244(a)(2), (13), (14), (27), (30). \\n \\n31 National Historic Trails , Nat\\u2019l Park Serv., https://www.nps. \\ngov/subjects/nationaltrailssystem/n ational-historic-trails.htm (last \\nvisited July 18, 2019).

Id. \\n25 \\n CONCLUSION \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision is inconsistent with \\nthe legal framework of the Trails Act, the national for-est statutes, and the Mineral Leasing Act. It is incon-\\nsistent with the established agency practice of over 50 \\nyears recognizing that\\u2014as between the Forest Service and Park Service\\u2014each agency administers its own \\nlands over which the Trail traverses. If there is to be \\nan alteration of the prior congressional dedication of the management and jurisdict ion of those national for-\\nests, that is for Congress\\u2014and not the courts\\u2014to de-\\ntermine. \\n Left unaddressed, the circuit court\\u2019s decision will \\nhave significant adverse consequences, not only for At-lantic and MVP, but also fo r future critical infrastruc-\\nture. Certiorari should be granted to clarify the status \\nof the national forest system lands traversed by the Appalachian National Scenic Trail and to remove the \\nbarriers to Trail-crossing authorizations imposed by \\nthe Fourth Circuit. \\nRespectfully submitted, \\nM\\nURRAY  D.

The 1968 National \\nTrails System Act (\\\"Trails Act\\\") designated the Appa-\\nlachian Trail as a national scenic trail to \\\"be adminis-tered primarily as a footpath by the Secretary of the Interior,\\\" 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1244(a)(1), but did not \\\"transfer among Federal agencies any management responsibil-ities established under any other law for federally ad-\\nministered lands\\\" traversed by a designated trail, id. \\n\\u00a7 1246(a)(1)(A). The Mineral Leasing Act (MLA), as amended in 1973, authorizes the \\\"Secretary of the In-terior or appropriate agency head\\\" to grant rights-of-way through any federal lands \\\"for pipeline purposes for the transportation of oil [and] natural gas.\\\" 30 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 185(a). \\\"Federal l ands\\\" means \\\"all lands owned \\nby the United States except lands in the National Park System.\\\" Id. \\u00a7 185(b)(1). The question presented is: \\n Whether the Forest Service has authority to grant \\nrights-of-way under the Mineral Leasing Act through lands traversed by the Appalachian Trail within na-tional forests. \\nii \\n \\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \\nPage \\n QUESTION PRESENTED...................................  i \\nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES .................................  iv INTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE  ......................  1 \\nBACKGROUND ...................................................  4 \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT ..............................  9 REASONS WHY THE PETITIONS SHOULD \\nBE GRANTED ..................................................  10 \\n I.

As approved by the Forest Service and FERC, \\nMVP would cross under the Trail footpath on the for-ested ridge marking the Virginia-West Virginia border, \\nwest of Roanoke, Virginia. The Forest Service required \\nMountain Valley to construct a 600-foot-long bore roughly 80 feet beneath the ridgetop and Trail. By \\nplacing the pipeline at this  depth, the Forest Service \\npreserved a football field- length (300-foot) forested \\nbuffer to each side of the Trail. Drilling equipment \\nwould temporarily be placed in pits downslope and not \\nvisible from the Trail. All construction-related impacts, \\n \\nworked for decades to obtain permanent protection for the en-\\ntirety of the Trail. However, th e uncertainty resulting from the \\nFourth Circuit's decision regard ing agency jurisdiction has cre-\\nated a further obstacle to comple ting a land exchange that would \\nprotect the Trail while providing a right-of-way for MVP. \\n 9 See MVP FEIS \\u00a7 3.0; MVP ROD 23-27.  \\n5 \\n such as noise, would be temporary, and no construction \\nwould occur on the footpath.10 \\n The Forest Service and BLM were well on their \\nway to addressing the Fourth Circuit's remand regard-\\ning MVP's approvals to cross the Jefferson National \\nForest when the Fourth Circuit issued the decision be-low. Mountain Valley was not a party to that proceed-\\ning, but the decision had the same practical effect for \\nMVP as it did for Atlantic\\u2014no federal agency could lawfully issue an MLA right-of-way to either pipeline \\nto cross the Trail on national forest lands. \\n 2.  The Appalachian Trail was conceived by pri-\\nvate individuals and hiking clubs in the 1920s as a \\nfootpath from Maine to Georgia.\\n11 With the support of \\nthe Forest Service, the George Washington and Jeffer-\\nson national forests and six other national forests \\nalong the Appalachians have included segments of the \\nTrail since its beginning. The National Park Service \\n(\\\"Park Service\\\") supported Trail construction in Shen-\\nandoah and Great Smoky Mountains national parks. \\n Groups of private volunteers, including numerous \\nhiking and outdoor recreation-oriented clubs along the eastern seaboard, took responsibility for construction \\n \\n 10 MVP ROD 27. \\n 11 See Nat'l Park Serv., U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Trails for \\nAmerica: Report on the  Nationwide Trail Study 32-33 (1966) (\\\" Trails \\nfor America \\\"), https://www.nps.gov/noco /learn/management/upload/ \\ntrails-for-america-1966.pdf.  \\n6 \\n and maintenance of local trail segments.12 The Forest \\nService and the Park Service dedicated significant \\neffort to trail-building under various Depression-era \\npublic works programs.13 By the time the Trail was \\ncompleted in 1937, more than 700 miles of the 2,200-\\nmile footpath had been constructed on federal lands, \\nmostly national forests. The majority of the newly com-pleted Appalachian Trail, however, remained on pri-\\nvate or state lands.\\n14 \\n The Park Service and the Forest Service were both \\nproponents of the Trail throughout its construction \\nand worked cooperatively to ensure maintenance and protection of the Trail after its completion.\\n15 Despite \\nthe federal land managers' important roles, most re-\\nsponsibility for trail management remained with the local trail clubs.\\n16 \\n \\n 12 Trails for America , 32-33; see generally  Appalachian Trail \\nConservancy, The Appalachian Trail: Celebrating America's \\nHiking Trail  15-38 (2012). \\n 13 Sally K.

See Light v. United States , 220 U.S. 523, 536-\\n37 (1911) (upholding federal government's authority to \\nestablish forest reserves a dministered by Secretary of \\nAgriculture). As this Court stated over a century ago, \\\"it is not for the courts to say how\\\" the national forests \\nand the nation's public land s \\\"shall be administered. \\nThat is for Congress to determine.\\\" Id. \\n By holding that the Appalachian Trail segment \\ncrossed by Atlantic consists of \\\"lands in the National \\nPark System,\\\" Pet. App. 55a, 57a (No. 18-1584), the \\nFourth Circuit not only misapplied the plain language \\nof the law, but also usurped Congress's exclusive con-stitutional prerogative to allocate among federal de-\\npartments jurisdiction over federal lands. The Fourth \\nCircuit erroneously conflated the Trail-related coordi-nation and administrative role that Congress assigned \\nto the Secretary of the In terior\\u2014and which the Secre-\\ntary later delegated to the Park Service\\u2014with the comprehensive land management and jurisdictional \\nresponsibility Congress assigned to the Secretary of \\nAgriculture, acting through the Forest Service. \\n The Fourth Circuit's decision directly contradicts \\nthe Trails Act's recognition that the federal agency ad-ministering the lands over which a national trail \\npasses may be different than the agency charged to \\n10 \\n administer that trail. It also contradicts Congress's \\nWeeks Act mandate that th e national forest lands \\ncrossed by MVP and Atlantic would be \\\"permanently \\nreserved, held and administered as national forest ,\\\" \\nnot national park , lands. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 521 (emphasis \\nadded). \\n The Forest Service and Park Service had for over \\n50 years prior to the circuit court's decision consist-\\nently interpreted the Trails Act to not alter the Forest Service's jurisdiction. Congre ss chose to promote inter-\\nagency and stakeholder coordination, but did so in a \\nway that maintained the Department of Agriculture's jurisdiction. Congress never designated the strips of \\nnational forest lands used by  the Trail as national park \\nlands. Congress simply assigned to the Interior Secre-tary the responsibility to acquire lands and coordinate \\namong the government agencies and trail clubs in-\\nvolved in managing various Trail segments. \\n--------------------------------- \\uf0a8 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nREASONS WHY THE \\nPETITIONS SHOULD BE GRANTED  \\n Rather than applying the plain text of the Trails \\nAct, which would harmonize it with the Weeks Act, the Fourth Circuit's decision found conflict where there is \\nnone. The Fourth Circuit's opinion usurps Congress's \\nplenary Property Clause power and imposes a result that conflicts with a half-century of agency practice. \\nSee Pet. at 24-25 (No. 18-1587); Pet. at 19-21 (No. \\n18-1584). The Fourth Circuit's decision contradicts \\n11 \\n the plain language of the W eeks Act and Trails Act and \\nCongress's consistent record of careful, deliberate sys-\\ntematizing of departmental jurisdiction over public \\nlands. Congress has been especially deliberate when deciding how to assign jurisdiction over public forest \\nlands between national forests and national parks. Na-\\ntional forests are managed for utilitarian, \\\"multiple use\\\" purposes. National parks are managed for preser-\\nvation. \\n The Fourth Circuit's erroneous interpretation, if \\nnot addressed by this Court, will create broad un-\\ncertainty over public l ands management and impose \\nsignificant risks on Atlantic, MVP, and existing and \\nplanned energy infrastructure well beyond the sites, \\nprojects, and parties involved here. The Mineral Leas-ing Act provides the principal federal authority for \\ngranting oil and gas pipeline rights-of-way on federal \\npublic lands. The Forest Service emphasizes correctly that the Trail-crossing issue is the only aspect of the \\ndecision below that cannot be addressed by further \\nagency analysis, factual review, public notice and com-ment, or clarification. See Pet. 13-14 (No. 18-1584). This \\ncritical point applies equally to MVP. If allowed to \\nstand, the decision below eliminates federal MLA au-thority to grant or renew rights-of-way for gas pipe-\\nlines serving the millions of  Americans living along the \\neastern seaboard if the pipeline crosses the Trail, a court-erected barrier from central Maine to north \\nGeorgia. \\n  \\n12 \\n I. The Appalachian Tr ail Segment Crossed \\nBy The ACP Project Is Not \\\"Land In The \\nNational Park System\\\" Under The Mineral Leasing Act. \\n The Forest Service used its management discre-\\ntion eight decades ago to approve and assist with con-\\nstruction of the footpath, sign s, and shelters on national \\nforest lands to help create the Appalachian Trail. But \\nit did not transfer the lands traversed by that footpath \\nto the Park Service. Neither did the Trails Act. \\n At times, the Park Service has characterized the \\nAppalachian Trail as a unit of the National Park Sys-tem for its internal labeling purposes. See, e.g., Pet. \\nApp. 55a (No. 18-1584). And so me segments of the Trail \\nare on lands inside national parks. But there is no ba-sis in the law for concluding that the entire 2,200-mile \\nfootpath has been transformed into \\\"lands in the Na-\\ntional Park System\\\" by a label. See 54 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 100102, \\n100501. The term is a conven ient administrative catch-\\nall, evident in the fact that Park System \\\"units\\\" often \\ninclude areas of non-federal ownership or areas under other agencies' jurisdictions. The Trail corridor con-\\ntains a variety of areas administered by state and fed-\\neral agencies and local entities.\\n20 \\n The Trail at the locations to be crossed by Atlantic \\nand MVP is a congressional ov erlay of a trails system \\nuse and footpath on national forest land, but it does not \\nchange the character or juris diction of that land. The \\n \\n 20 Nat'l Parks Conservation Ass'n, Appalachian National \\nScenic Trail: A Special Report  3 (March 2010). \\n13 \\n place remains national forest land. The inter-agency \\nand stakeholder cooperation for the Trail coordinated \\nby the Secretary of the Interior is a procedural re-\\nquirement of the Trails Ac t, not a reallocation of \\nland management jurisdiction from the Department of \\nAgriculture to the Department of the Interior. \\n \\nA. Statutory Background. \\n1. The National Forest System. \\n In 1891, Congress authorized the President to \\\"set \\napart and reserve . . . public land bearing forests . . . as \\npublic reservations.\\\" Forest Reserve Act of 1891, ch. \\n561, \\u00a7 24, 26 Stat. 1103 (codif ied at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 471 \\n(repealed 1976)). In the Organic Administration Act \\nof 1897, Congress provided that \\\"[n]o national forest \\nshall be established, except to improve and protect the forest within the boundaries, or for the purpose of \\nsecuring favorable conditions of water flows, and to \\nfurnish a continuous supply of timber.\\\" Organic Ad-ministration Act of 1897, ch. 2, \\u00a7 1, 30 Stat. 34 (codi-\\nfied at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 475). In 1905, Congress transferred \\njurisdiction over the national forests from the Depart-ment of the Interior to the Department of Agriculture. \\nForest Transfer Act of 1905, ch. 288, \\u00a7 1, 33 Stat. 628 \\n(codified as amended at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 472). The Forest Transfer Act directs that \\\"the Department of Agricul-\\nture shall execute . . . all laws affecting public lands \\nheretofore or hereafter reserved\\\" as forest reserves under the 1891 Act. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 472. These acts, ini-\\ntially focused on public lands in the western United \\n14 \\n States, established the foundation of the current na-\\ntional forest system. See 36 C.F.R. \\u00a7 200.3(b)(2). \\n The 1911 Weeks Act then authorized the Secretary \\nof Agriculture to acquire pri vate lands to establish na-\\ntional forests in the eastern United States. Act of Mar. \\n1, 1911, ch. 186, \\u00a7 9, 36 Stat. 962, \\u00a7 6 (codified at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 515).\\n21 Congress also directed that those lands \\nbe \\\"permanently reserved, held, and administered as \\nnational forest lands under the provisions of \\\" the 1891 Act as supplemented. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 521; see also id . \\n\\u00a7 521a. Both the George Washington and Jefferson na-\\ntional forests were among th e first national forests es-\\ntablished pursuant to these authorities.\\n22 \\n From the beginning, national forests were to be \\nmanaged for \\\"multiple use,\\\" diverse public purposes \\nincluding commercial activi ties such as timber har-\\nvest, mining, grazing, and energy development. See, \\ne.g., United States v. New Mexico , 438 U.S. 696, 706-09 \\n& n.18 (1978); United States v. Grimaud , 220 U.S. 506, \\n515 (1911); Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960, 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 528-531; Charles F. Wilkinson & H. \\n \\n 21 See also  Harold K. Steen, The U.S. Forest Service: A His-\\ntory 122-29 (1976) (history of the Weeks Act). \\n 22 See Proclamation No. 1448, 40 Stat. 1779 (1918) (estab-\\nlishing the Shenandoah National Forest); Exec. Order No. 5867 (June 28, 1932) (renaming the Shenandoah National Forest the George Washington National Forest); Proclamation No. 2165, 1 Fed. Reg. 227, 227-29 (Apr. 24, 1936) (establishing the Jefferson \\nNational Forest); see also  Forest Serv., U.S. Dep't of Agric., George \\nWashington National Forest: A History  11, 15 (1993), https://www. \\nfs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOC UMENTS/stelprd3832787.pdf. \\n15 \\n Michael Anderson, Land and Resource Planning in the \\nNational Forests , 64 Or. L. Rev. 1, 20-23, 53-60 (1985). \\n Congress has adjusted the Forest Service's mis-\\nsion over time, but the mission has always included the \\nresponsibility to use the agency's wide discretion to \\nmake land and resource decisions that balance among various, often competing uses. When Congress decides \\nto require the Forest Service to depart from multiple-\\nuse principles in order to exclude forest lands from commercial uses, Congress does so by specific direc-\\ntion, for instance by designat ing that certain areas be \\nmanaged as national forest wilderness, including vari-ous locations that include the Trail footpath,\\n23 none of \\nwhich are crossed by Atlantic or MVP. \\n \\n2. The National Park System.  \\n Congress established the National Park System to \\npreserve, not develop, federal lands and resources. The \\nPark Service's preservation mission is very different from the Forest Service's utilitarian mission.\\n24 In 1916, \\n \\n 23 E.g., Act of Nov. 9, 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-471, 114 Stat. \\n2057 (designating the Priest Wilderness Area in Virginia); Act of Oct. 30, 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-586, 98 Stat. 3105 (designating the Thunder Ridge, Mountain Lake , Peters Mountain, Beartown, \\nLittle Wilson Creek, Lewis Fork, Priest Wilderness Areas in Virginia). \\n \\n24 See, e.g., Joseph L. Sax, Mountains Without Handrails, Re-\\nflections on the National Parks  5-9 (1980) (describing early history \\nand development of federal national parks policy); see generally  \\nJohn Ise, Our National Park Policy: A Critical History  185-95 \\n(1961) (history of national park policy during the period preceding and accompanying completion of the Appalachian Trail); Elmo R. \\n \\n16 \\n Congress provided that the \\\"fundamental purposes of \\nthe said parks, monuments, and reservations . . . is to \\nconserve the scenery and the natural and historic ob-\\njects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same . . . unimpaired for the enjoy-\\nment of future generations.\\\" Nat'l Park Serv. Organic \\nAct of 1916, ch. 408, \\u00a7 1, 39 Stat. 535 (codified as \\namended at 54 U.S.C. \\u00a7 100101). \\n National park lands are to be preserved and, where \\npossible, enjoyed. But for the national forests, Con-\\ngress has long emphasized t hat \\\"there must always be \\n. . . as primary objects and purposes the utilitarian use of land, of water, and of timber, as contributing to the \\nwealth of all the people.\\\" H.R . Rep. No. 64-700, at 3 (1916). \\n \\n3. The National Trails System.  \\n The National Trails System Act seeks \\\"to promote \\nthe preservation of, public a ccess to, travel within, and \\nenjoyment and appreciation of the open-air, outdoor areas and historic resources of the Nation.\\\" 16 U.S.C. \\n\\u00a7 1241(a). The Trails Act authorized the creation of a \\nNational Trail System comprised of the national his-toric trails, national recreation trails, and national sce-\\nnic trails. Id. \\u00a7 1242(a). \\n The Trails Act designated the Appalachian Trail \\nand the Pacific Crest Trail as  the nation's first national \\n \\nRichardson, The Politics of Conservation: Crusades and Contro-\\nversies 1897-1913 , at 22-46 (1962) (history of formative public pol-\\nicy debates over assignment of departmental authority over federal forest lands). \\n17 \\n scenic trails. Id. \\u00a7 1244(a)(1). The Act delegated re-\\nsponsibility to coordinate administration of the Appa-\\nlachian Trail to the Secretary of the Interior and gave \\nthe Secretary of Agriculture equivalent responsibility for the Pacific Crest Trail. Congress did not change the \\njurisdictional status of the lands over which the trails \\ncross. As Professor Fairfax explained, \\\"[i]rrespective of which Secretary has overa ll responsibility for a trail \\n[under the Trails Act], the Sec retary of the Interior is \\nin charge when a trail crosses Park or Bureau of Land Management lands and the Secr etary of Agriculture is \\nresponsible for management when a trail crosses For-\\nest Service land.\\\"\\n25 \\n The Trails Act recognizes that a federal agency \\nother than the agency charged with the overall ad-ministration of a trail may have authority and re-\\nsponsibility for the administration of the lands  over \\nwhich the trail traverses. The latter retains its author-ity to administer those l ands despite the trail's pres-\\nence. The statute is unambigu ous: \\\"Nothing . . . shall \\nbe deemed to transfer among Federal agencies any management responsibilities established under any \\nother law for federally admi nistered lands which are \\ncomponents of the National Trails System.\\\" See 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 1246(a)(1)(A). \\n \\n \\n 25 Fairfax, Federal-State Cooperation , supra note 13, at 58; \\nsee also Cong. Research Serv., R43868, The National Trails Sys-\\ntem: A Brief Overview  6-7 (2015). \\n18 \\n B. When Congress Transfers Administrative \\nJurisdiction From The Agriculture De-\\npartment's Forest Service And The Inte-\\nrior Department's Park  Service, It Does \\nSo Explicitly. \\n The structure of the Trails  Act consistently reflects \\nCongress's intent that federal agency land manage-\\nment jurisdiction be left undisturbed.

On the same day he signed the \\nTrails Act, President John son signed legislation es-\\ntablishing North Cascades National Park. That con-\\ntemporaneous legislation expressly transferred the \\nadministrative jurisdiction of lands from the national \\nforest system to the National Park System: \\nFederal property within the boundaries of the \\npark and recreation areas is hereby trans-ferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the \\nSecretary [of the Interior] for administration \\nby him as part of the park and recreation \\n19 \\n areas. The national forest land within such \\nboundaries is hereby eliminated from the na-\\ntional forests within which it was heretofore \\nlocated.  \\nAct of Jan. 15, 1968, Pub. L. No. 90-544, 82 Stat. 926 \\n(codified at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 90b(a)) (emphasis added).26 \\n Similarly, when establishing Great Basin National \\nPark some years later, Cong ress specified that \\\"[l]ands \\nand waters . . . within the boundaries of the park which \\nwere administered by the Forest Service . . . prior to \\n[the date of enactment of this Act] are hereby trans-ferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secre-\\ntary [of the Interior].\\\" 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 410mm-2; see also 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 192b-9 (boundary adjustments for Rocky Mountain National Park). \\n Two examples from the Appalachian Trail area \\nfurther demonstrate that when Congress puts land \\ninto a national park system unit, it says so. See 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 403k-1 (\\\"Subject to valid existing rights, all lands within the boundaries of Great Smoky Moun-\\ntains National Park . . . hereafter shall be a part of the \\n \\n 26 In President Johnson's remarks on signing the Trails Act, \\nhe stated that \\\"[o]ur history of wise management of America's na-tional forests has assisted us in designating the initial elements of the National Trails System. . . . : the Appalachian Trail and the \\nPacific Crest Trail.\\\" Presidential Remarks Upon Signing Four Bills Relating to Conservation and Outdoor Recreation, 2 Pub. Papers 1000, 1001 (Oct. 2, 1968). H ad the Trails Act involved an \\nextensive jurisdictional transfer of national forest system land to the Park Service for the Appalachian Trail, it would have been unusual for the President to invoke the history of America's na-\\ntional forest  management as an impetus for designating the Trail. \\n20 \\n national park and shall be subject to all laws, rules, \\nand regulations applicable to the national park.\\\"); 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 403-3 (\\\"Subject to valid existing rights, the \\nlands and interests in lands which comprise section 1-A of the Blue Ridge Parkway . . . are excluded from the \\nparkway, made a part of the Shenandoah National \\nPark, and shall be administer ed in accordance with the \\nAct of August 25, 1916 (39 Stat. 535; 16 U.S.C. 1-4).\\\"). \\n Such jurisdictional transfer language is conspicu-\\nously absent from the Trails Act. Simply put, had Con-\\ngress intended to convert the Trail corridor lands into \\nlands of the National Park System, it would have said so. Any uncertainty over the significance of the absence \\nof transfer language should have been put to rest by \\nthe fact that the Trails Act lacks any of the other or-ganizational provisions that might reasonably be ex-\\npected to accompany a major change in allocation of \\nexecutive branch responsibilities across eight national forests in a fourteen-state region. The Trails Act makes \\nno mention of budget authority, personnel and prop-\\nerty reassignment, transition  schedule or process, re-\\nassignment of permits or easements. Indeed, the Trails \\nAct does not mention the Park Service except for the \\npurpose of maintaining a Trail map. See Whitman v. \\nAm. Trucking Ass'n , 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001) (\\\"Con-\\ngress . . . does not alter the fundamental details of a \\nregulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provi-sions\\u2014it does not, one might say, hide elephants in \\nmouseholes.\\\"). \\n Three other considerations strongly reinforce the \\nconclusion that the circuit court erred in interpreting \\n21 \\n the Trails Act. First , Congress had rejected at least \\neight proposals to transfer the national forests to the \\nInterior Department in the years preceding enactment \\nof the Trails Act, and it is highly unlikely that it would \\nhave transferred national forest lands sub silentio .27 \\nSecond , Congress has given significant consideration \\nto the question whether the relevant portions of the George Washington and Jefferson national forests \\ndeserved enhanced protection  from commercial develop-\\nment and has chosen not to do so, thus strongly indicat-ing that Congress would not have done indirectly by \\nimplication what it has de clined to do directly.\\n28 Third , \\n \\n 27 Ross W.

Congress has designated numerous sections of \\nGeorge Washington and Jefferson national forest  lands crossed \\nby the Appalachian Trail as wilderness under the Wilderness Act \\n \\n22 \\n numerous major interstate gas pipelines crossed the \\nlands used for the Trail at the time Congress approved \\nthe Trails Act.29 The interstate pipelines were then, as \\ntoday, subject to federal approval under the provisions of the Natural Gas Act. Had Congress sought to change \\nthe federal approval process for gas pipelines inter-\\nsecting the path of the Trail, it would have said some-thing, especially if the in tended change amounted to a \\nprohibition of federal rights-of-way. \\n \\nII. The Circuit Court's Holding Conflicts With \\nThis Court's Decisions On Harmonizing Potentially Confli cting Statutes. \\n The Fourth Circuit was faced with reconciling the \\nTrails Act with the Weeks Act to determine the ap-\\nplicability of the Mineral Leasing Act. The court mis-characterized the Trails Act in a way that presented an \\napparent conflict with the Weeks Act, which in turn vi-\\ntiated the Mineral Leasing Act. The court made no \\n \\nof 1964, 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1131-1136. See, e.g., Act of Oct. 30, 1984, \\nPub. L. No. 98-586, 98 Stat. 3105 (designating the Thunder Ridge, Mountain Lake, Peters Mountain, Beartown, Little Wilson Creek, \\nLewis Fork, Priest Wi lderness Areas in Virg inia). Congress has \\nnever found that the national forest lands proposed to be used for the Atlantic or MVP below-grade Trail crossings warrant wilder-ness protection. \\n \\n29 A 1968 map prepared by the Federal Power Commission, \\nFERC's predecessor agency charged with implementation of the Natural Gas Act, shows multiple major gas pipelines in the area \\nof the Trail. That map is included as Attachment A. Attachment B shows the approximate route of the Trail superimposed on the map by amicus  Mountain Valley using contemporary geographic \\ninformation system data for the Trail's current route. \\n23 \\n effort to interpret the Weeks Act in concert with the \\nTrails Act. By failing to even try to reconcile and har-\\nmonize the statutes, the Fourth Circuit transformed \\n\\\"from expounder[ ] of what the law is into policy-\\nmaker[ ] choosing what the law should be .\\\" Epic Sys. \\nCorp. v. Lewis , 138 S. Ct. 1612, 1624 (2018). \\n When \\\"confronted with two Acts of Congress alleg-\\nedly touching on the same topic, this Court is not at \\n'liberty to pick and choose among congressional enact-ments' and must instead strive 'to give effect to both.' \\\" \\nId. (quoting Morton v. Mancari , 417 U.S. 535, 551 \\n(1974)). The project challengers below bore a \\\"heavy burden\\\"\\u2014that was never met or even considered by \\nthe circuit court\\u2014to show that Congress implicitly dis-\\nplaced the controlling national forest-administration statutes through the 1968 Trails Act. See id . \\n The circuit court simply presumed  that the entire \\nalmost 2,200-mile long Trail corridor is land in the \\n\\\"National Park System\\\" because the Trail was generi-\\ncally referenced in the record as a \\\" 'unit' of the Na-tional Park System.\\\" Pet. App. 55a (No. 18-1584). But \\na shorthand labeling reference, useful to agency staff \\nresponding to an internal Interior Department delega-tion of responsibility to implement the Trails Act, does \\nnot itself transfer administration of all lands within \\nthe Trail corridor to the Park Service, change the language of the Trails Act, or even modify the Park \\nService's own longstanding administrative interpreta-\\ntion, application, and understanding of the Trails Act as reflected in the agency's management documents \\nand consistent practice. See FCC v. Fox TV Stations , \\n24 \\n 556 U.S. 502, 513-16 (2009); see also  Pet. at 24-25 (No. \\n18-1587); Pet. at 19-21 (No. 18-1584). \\n The circuit court's approach results in an implau-\\nsible reading of the Trails Act. Extending the Fourth \\nCircuit's reasoning to other national scenic trails, such \\nas the Continental Divide Trail, where the Trails Act assigns to the Secretary of Agriculture the trail-admin-\\nistration role, see 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1244(a)(5), would convert \\nnarrow strips of Yellowstone, Glacier, and Rocky Moun-tain national parks into national forests without any \\ncongressional action. The same would hold true for the \\nfive other national scenic or historic trails adminis-tered by the Forest Service, many of which also trav-\\nerse national park system lands.\\n30 Numerous other \\nnational scenic and historic trails are administered by \\nthe Park Service.

As approved by the Forest Service and FERC, \\nMVP would cross under the Trail footpath on the for-ested ridge marking the Virginia-West Virginia border, \\nwest of Roanoke, Virginia. The Forest Service required \\nMountain Valley to construct a 600-foot-long bore roughly 80 feet beneath the ridgetop and Trail. By \\nplacing the pipeline at this  depth, the Forest Service \\npreserved a football field- length (300-foot) forested \\nbuffer to each side of the Trail.

The National Park Service \\n(\\\"Park Service\\\") supported Trail construction in Shen-\\nandoah and Great Smoky Mountains national parks. \\n Groups of private volunteers, including numerous \\nhiking and outdoor recreation-oriented clubs along the eastern seaboard, took responsibility for construction \\n \\n 10 MVP ROD 27. \\n 11 See Nat'l Park Serv., U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Trails for \\nAmerica: Report on the  Nationwide Trail Study 32-33 (1966) (\\\" Trails \\nfor America \\\"), https://www.nps.gov/noco /learn/management/upload/ \\ntrails-for-america-1966.pdf.  \\n6 \\n and maintenance of local trail segments.12 The Forest \\nService and the Park Service dedicated significant \\neffort to trail-building under various Depression-era \\npublic works programs.13 By the time the Trail was \\ncompleted in 1937, more than 700 miles of the 2,200-\\nmile footpath had been constructed on federal lands, \\nmostly national forests. The majority of the newly com-pleted Appalachian Trail, however, remained on pri-\\nvate or state lands.\\n14 \\n The Park Service and the Forest Service were both \\nproponents of the Trail throughout its construction \\nand worked cooperatively to ensure maintenance and protection of the Trail after its completion.\\n15 Despite \\nthe federal land managers' important roles, most re-\\nsponsibility for trail management remained with the local trail clubs.\\n16 \\n \\n 12 Trails for America , 32-33; see generally  Appalachian Trail \\nConservancy, The Appalachian Trail: Celebrating America's \\nHiking Trail  15-38 (2012). \\n 13 Sally K.

See Light v. United States , 220 U.S. 523, 536-\\n37 (1911) (upholding federal government's authority to \\nestablish forest reserves a dministered by Secretary of \\nAgriculture). As this Court stated over a century ago, \\\"it is not for the courts to say how\\\" the national forests \\nand the nation's public land s \\\"shall be administered. \\nThat is for Congress to determine.\\\" Id. \\n By holding that the Appalachian Trail segment \\ncrossed by Atlantic consists of \\\"lands in the National \\nPark System,\\\" Pet. App. 55a, 57a (No. 18-1584), the \\nFourth Circuit not only misapplied the plain language \\nof the law, but also usurped Congress's exclusive con-stitutional prerogative to allocate among federal de-\\npartments jurisdiction over federal lands. The Fourth \\nCircuit erroneously conflated the Trail-related coordi-nation and administrative role that Congress assigned \\nto the Secretary of the In terior\\u2014and which the Secre-\\ntary later delegated to the Park Service\\u2014with the comprehensive land management and jurisdictional \\nresponsibility Congress assigned to the Secretary of \\nAgriculture, acting through the Forest Service. \\n The Fourth Circuit's decision directly contradicts \\nthe Trails Act's recognition that the federal agency ad-ministering the lands over which a national trail \\npasses may be different than the agency charged to \\n10 \\n administer that trail. It also contradicts Congress's \\nWeeks Act mandate that th e national forest lands \\ncrossed by MVP and Atlantic would be \\\"permanently \\nreserved, held and administered as national forest ,\\\" \\nnot national park , lands. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 521 (emphasis \\nadded). \\n The Forest Service and Park Service had for over \\n50 years prior to the circuit court's decision consist-\\nently interpreted the Trails Act to not alter the Forest Service's jurisdiction. Congre ss chose to promote inter-\\nagency and stakeholder coordination, but did so in a \\nway that maintained the Department of Agriculture's jurisdiction. Congress never designated the strips of \\nnational forest lands used by  the Trail as national park \\nlands. Congress simply assigned to the Interior Secre-tary the responsibility to acquire lands and coordinate \\namong the government agencies and trail clubs in-\\nvolved in managing various Trail segments. \\n--------------------------------- \\uf0a8 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nREASONS WHY THE \\nPETITIONS SHOULD BE GRANTED  \\n Rather than applying the plain text of the Trails \\nAct, which would harmonize it with the Weeks Act, the Fourth Circuit's decision found conflict where there is \\nnone. The Fourth Circuit's opinion usurps Congress's \\nplenary Property Clause power and imposes a result that conflicts with a half-century of agency practice. \\nSee Pet. at 24-25 (No. 18-1587); Pet. at 19-21 (No. \\n18-1584). The Fourth Circuit's decision contradicts \\n11 \\n the plain language of the W eeks Act and Trails Act and \\nCongress's consistent record of careful, deliberate sys-\\ntematizing of departmental jurisdiction over public \\nlands. Congress has been especially deliberate when deciding how to assign jurisdiction over public forest \\nlands between national forests and national parks. Na-\\ntional forests are managed for utilitarian, \\\"multiple use\\\" purposes. National parks are managed for preser-\\nvation. \\n The Fourth Circuit's erroneous interpretation, if \\nnot addressed by this Court, will create broad un-\\ncertainty over public l ands management and impose \\nsignificant risks on Atlantic, MVP, and existing and \\nplanned energy infrastructure well beyond the sites, \\nprojects, and parties involved here. The Mineral Leas-ing Act provides the principal federal authority for \\ngranting oil and gas pipeline rights-of-way on federal \\npublic lands. The Forest Service emphasizes correctly that the Trail-crossing issue is the only aspect of the \\ndecision below that cannot be addressed by further \\nagency analysis, factual review, public notice and com-ment, or clarification. See Pet. 13-14 (No. 18-1584). This \\ncritical point applies equally to MVP. If allowed to \\nstand, the decision below eliminates federal MLA au-thority to grant or renew rights-of-way for gas pipe-\\nlines serving the millions of  Americans living along the \\neastern seaboard if the pipeline crosses the Trail, a court-erected barrier from central Maine to north \\nGeorgia. \\n  \\n12 \\n I. The Appalachian Tr ail Segment Crossed \\nBy The ACP Project Is Not \\\"Land In The \\nNational Park System\\\" Under The Mineral Leasing Act. \\n The Forest Service used its management discre-\\ntion eight decades ago to approve and assist with con-\\nstruction of the footpath, sign s, and shelters on national \\nforest lands to help create the Appalachian Trail. But \\nit did not transfer the lands traversed by that footpath \\nto the Park Service. Neither did the Trails Act. \\n At times, the Park Service has characterized the \\nAppalachian Trail as a unit of the National Park Sys-tem for its internal labeling purposes. See, e.g., Pet. \\nApp. 55a (No. 18-1584). And so me segments of the Trail \\nare on lands inside national parks. But there is no ba-sis in the law for concluding that the entire 2,200-mile \\nfootpath has been transformed into \\\"lands in the Na-\\ntional Park System\\\" by a label. See 54 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 100102, \\n100501. The term is a conven ient administrative catch-\\nall, evident in the fact that Park System \\\"units\\\" often \\ninclude areas of non-federal ownership or areas under other agencies' jurisdictions. The Trail corridor con-\\ntains a variety of areas administered by state and fed-\\neral agencies and local entities.\\n20 \\n The Trail at the locations to be crossed by Atlantic \\nand MVP is a congressional ov erlay of a trails system \\nuse and footpath on national forest land, but it does not \\nchange the character or juris diction of that land. The \\n \\n 20 Nat'l Parks Conservation Ass'n, Appalachian National \\nScenic Trail: A Special Report  3 (March 2010). \\n13 \\n place remains national forest land. The inter-agency \\nand stakeholder cooperation for the Trail coordinated \\nby the Secretary of the Interior is a procedural re-\\nquirement of the Trails Ac t, not a reallocation of \\nland management jurisdiction from the Department of \\nAgriculture to the Department of the Interior. \\n \\nA. Statutory Background. \\n1. The National Forest System. \\n In 1891, Congress authorized the President to \\\"set \\napart and reserve . . . public land bearing forests . . . as \\npublic reservations.\\\" Forest Reserve Act of 1891, ch. \\n561, \\u00a7 24, 26 Stat. 1103 (codif ied at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 471 \\n(repealed 1976)). In the Organic Administration Act \\nof 1897, Congress provided that \\\"[n]o national forest \\nshall be established, except to improve and protect the forest within the boundaries, or for the purpose of \\nsecuring favorable conditions of water flows, and to \\nfurnish a continuous supply of timber.\\\" Organic Ad-ministration Act of 1897, ch. 2, \\u00a7 1, 30 Stat. 34 (codi-\\nfied at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 475). In 1905, Congress transferred \\njurisdiction over the national forests from the Depart-ment of the Interior to the Department of Agriculture. \\nForest Transfer Act of 1905, ch. 288, \\u00a7 1, 33 Stat. 628 \\n(codified as amended at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 472). The Forest Transfer Act directs that \\\"the Department of Agricul-\\nture shall execute . . . all laws affecting public lands \\nheretofore or hereafter reserved\\\" as forest reserves under the 1891 Act. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 472. These acts, ini-\\ntially focused on public lands in the western United \\n14 \\n States, established the foundation of the current na-\\ntional forest system. See 36 C.F.R. \\u00a7 200.3(b)(2). \\n The 1911 Weeks Act then authorized the Secretary \\nof Agriculture to acquire pri vate lands to establish na-\\ntional forests in the eastern United States. Act of Mar. \\n1, 1911, ch. 186, \\u00a7 9, 36 Stat. 962, \\u00a7 6 (codified at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 515).\\n21 Congress also directed that those lands \\nbe \\\"permanently reserved, held, and administered as \\nnational forest lands under the provisions of \\\" the 1891 Act as supplemented. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 521; see also id . \\n\\u00a7 521a. Both the George Washington and Jefferson na-\\ntional forests were among th e first national forests es-\\ntablished pursuant to these authorities.\\n22 \\n From the beginning, national forests were to be \\nmanaged for \\\"multiple use,\\\" diverse public purposes \\nincluding commercial activi ties such as timber har-\\nvest, mining, grazing, and energy development. See, \\ne.g., United States v. New Mexico , 438 U.S. 696, 706-09 \\n& n.18 (1978); United States v. Grimaud , 220 U.S. 506, \\n515 (1911); Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960, 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 528-531; Charles F. Wilkinson & H. \\n \\n 21 See also  Harold K. Steen, The U.S. Forest Service: A His-\\ntory 122-29 (1976) (history of the Weeks Act). \\n 22 See Proclamation No. 1448, 40 Stat. 1779 (1918) (estab-\\nlishing the Shenandoah National Forest); Exec. Order No. 5867 (June 28, 1932) (renaming the Shenandoah National Forest the George Washington National Forest); Proclamation No. 2165, 1 Fed. Reg. 227, 227-29 (Apr. 24, 1936) (establishing the Jefferson \\nNational Forest); see also  Forest Serv., U.S. Dep't of Agric., George \\nWashington National Forest: A History  11, 15 (1993), https://www. \\nfs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOC UMENTS/stelprd3832787.pdf. \\n15 \\n Michael Anderson, Land and Resource Planning in the \\nNational Forests , 64 Or. L. Rev. 1, 20-23, 53-60 (1985). \\n Congress has adjusted the Forest Service's mis-\\nsion over time, but the mission has always included the \\nresponsibility to use the agency's wide discretion to \\nmake land and resource decisions that balance among various, often competing uses. When Congress decides \\nto require the Forest Service to depart from multiple-\\nuse principles in order to exclude forest lands from commercial uses, Congress does so by specific direc-\\ntion, for instance by designat ing that certain areas be \\nmanaged as national forest wilderness, including vari-ous locations that include the Trail footpath,\\n23 none of \\nwhich are crossed by Atlantic or MVP. \\n \\n2. The National Park System.  \\n Congress established the National Park System to \\npreserve, not develop, federal lands and resources. The \\nPark Service's preservation mission is very different from the Forest Service's utilitarian mission.\\n24 In 1916, \\n \\n 23 E.g., Act of Nov. 9, 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-471, 114 Stat. \\n2057 (designating the Priest Wilderness Area in Virginia); Act of Oct. 30, 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-586, 98 Stat. 3105 (designating the Thunder Ridge, Mountain Lake , Peters Mountain, Beartown, \\nLittle Wilson Creek, Lewis Fork, Priest Wilderness Areas in Virginia). \\n \\n24 See, e.g., Joseph L. Sax, Mountains Without Handrails, Re-\\nflections on the National Parks  5-9 (1980) (describing early history \\nand development of federal national parks policy); see generally  \\nJohn Ise, Our National Park Policy: A Critical History  185-95 \\n(1961) (history of national park policy during the period preceding and accompanying completion of the Appalachian Trail); Elmo R. \\n \\n16 \\n Congress provided that the \\\"fundamental purposes of \\nthe said parks, monuments, and reservations . . . is to \\nconserve the scenery and the natural and historic ob-\\njects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same . . . unimpaired for the enjoy-\\nment of future generations.\\\" Nat'l Park Serv. Organic \\nAct of 1916, ch. 408, \\u00a7 1, 39 Stat. 535 (codified as \\namended at 54 U.S.C. \\u00a7 100101). \\n National park lands are to be preserved and, where \\npossible, enjoyed. But for the national forests, Con-\\ngress has long emphasized t hat \\\"there must always be \\n. . . as primary objects and purposes the utilitarian use of land, of water, and of timber, as contributing to the \\nwealth of all the people.\\\" H.R . Rep. No. 64-700, at 3 (1916). \\n \\n3. The National Trails System.  \\n The National Trails System Act seeks \\\"to promote \\nthe preservation of, public a ccess to, travel within, and \\nenjoyment and appreciation of the open-air, outdoor areas and historic resources of the Nation.\\\" 16 U.S.C. \\n\\u00a7 1241(a). The Trails Act authorized the creation of a \\nNational Trail System comprised of the national his-toric trails, national recreation trails, and national sce-\\nnic trails. Id. \\u00a7 1242(a). \\n The Trails Act designated the Appalachian Trail \\nand the Pacific Crest Trail as  the nation's first national \\n \\nRichardson, The Politics of Conservation: Crusades and Contro-\\nversies 1897-1913 , at 22-46 (1962) (history of formative public pol-\\nicy debates over assignment of departmental authority over federal forest lands). \\n17 \\n scenic trails. Id. \\u00a7 1244(a)(1). The Act delegated re-\\nsponsibility to coordinate administration of the Appa-\\nlachian Trail to the Secretary of the Interior and gave \\nthe Secretary of Agriculture equivalent responsibility for the Pacific Crest Trail. Congress did not change the \\njurisdictional status of the lands over which the trails \\ncross. As Professor Fairfax explained, \\\"[i]rrespective of which Secretary has overa ll responsibility for a trail \\n[under the Trails Act], the Sec retary of the Interior is \\nin charge when a trail crosses Park or Bureau of Land Management lands and the Secr etary of Agriculture is \\nresponsible for management when a trail crosses For-\\nest Service land.\\\"\\n25 \\n The Trails Act recognizes that a federal agency \\nother than the agency charged with the overall ad-ministration of a trail may have authority and re-\\nsponsibility for the administration of the lands  over \\nwhich the trail traverses. The latter retains its author-ity to administer those l ands despite the trail's pres-\\nence. The statute is unambigu ous: \\\"Nothing . . . shall \\nbe deemed to transfer among Federal agencies any management responsibilities established under any \\nother law for federally admi nistered lands which are \\ncomponents of the National Trails System.\\\" See 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 1246(a)(1)(A). \\n \\n \\n 25 Fairfax, Federal-State Cooperation , supra note 13, at 58; \\nsee also Cong. Research Serv., R43868, The National Trails Sys-\\ntem: A Brief Overview  6-7 (2015). \\n18 \\n B. When Congress Transfers Administrative \\nJurisdiction From The Agriculture De-\\npartment's Forest Service And The Inte-\\nrior Department's Park  Service, It Does \\nSo Explicitly. \\n The structure of the Trails  Act consistently reflects \\nCongress's intent that federal agency land manage-\\nment jurisdiction be left undisturbed. The \\\"Secretary \\ncharged with the administration of a national scenic . . . trail may relocate segments of a national scenic . . . \\ntrail right-of-way,\\\" but only \\\" with the concurrence of \\nthe head of the Federal agency having jurisdiction over the lands involved .\\\" 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1246(b) (emphasis \\nadded). The Secretary \\\"may issue regulations,\\\" but \\nonly \\\" with the concurrence of the heads of any other \\nFederal agencies administering lands through which a \\n. . . national scenic . . . trail passes .\\\" Id. \\u00a7 1246(i) (em-\\nphasis added). \\n Congress elsewhere consistently has been explicit \\nwhen it intends to transfe r jurisdiction from one fed-\\neral agency to ano ther. On the same day he signed the \\nTrails Act, President John son signed legislation es-\\ntablishing North Cascades National Park. That con-\\ntemporaneous legislation expressly transferred the \\nadministrative jurisdiction of lands from the national \\nforest system to the National Park System: \\nFederal property within the boundaries of the \\npark and recreation areas is hereby trans-ferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the \\nSecretary [of the Interior] for administration \\nby him as part of the park and recreation \\n19 \\n areas. The national forest land within such \\nboundaries is hereby eliminated from the na-\\ntional forests within which it was heretofore \\nlocated.  \\nAct of Jan. 15, 1968, Pub. L. No. 90-544, 82 Stat. 926 \\n(codified at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 90b(a)) (emphasis added).26 \\n Similarly, when establishing Great Basin National \\nPark some years later, Cong ress specified that \\\"[l]ands \\nand waters . . . within the boundaries of the park which \\nwere administered by the Forest Service . . . prior to \\n[the date of enactment of this Act] are hereby trans-ferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secre-\\ntary [of the Interior].\\\" 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 410mm-2; see also 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 192b-9 (boundary adjustments for Rocky Mountain National Park). \\n Two examples from the Appalachian Trail area \\nfurther demonstrate that when Congress puts land \\ninto a national park system unit, it says so. See 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 403k-1 (\\\"Subject to valid existing rights, all lands within the boundaries of Great Smoky Moun-\\ntains National Park . . . hereafter shall be a part of the \\n \\n 26 In President Johnson's remarks on signing the Trails Act, \\nhe stated that \\\"[o]ur history of wise management of America's na-tional forests has assisted us in designating the initial elements of the National Trails System. . . . : the Appalachian Trail and the \\nPacific Crest Trail.\\\" Presidential Remarks Upon Signing Four Bills Relating to Conservation and Outdoor Recreation, 2 Pub. Papers 1000, 1001 (Oct. 2, 1968). H ad the Trails Act involved an \\nextensive jurisdictional transfer of national forest system land to the Park Service for the Appalachian Trail, it would have been unusual for the President to invoke the history of America's na-\\ntional forest  management as an impetus for designating the Trail. \\n20 \\n national park and shall be subject to all laws, rules, \\nand regulations applicable to the national park.\\\"); 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 403-3 (\\\"Subject to valid existing rights, the \\nlands and interests in lands which comprise section 1-A of the Blue Ridge Parkway . . . are excluded from the \\nparkway, made a part of the Shenandoah National \\nPark, and shall be administer ed in accordance with the \\nAct of August 25, 1916 (39 Stat. 535; 16 U.S.C. 1-4).\\\"). \\n Such jurisdictional transfer language is conspicu-\\nously absent from the Trails Act. Simply put, had Con-\\ngress intended to convert the Trail corridor lands into \\nlands of the National Park System, it would have said so. Any uncertainty over the significance of the absence \\nof transfer language should have been put to rest by \\nthe fact that the Trails Act lacks any of the other or-ganizational provisions that might reasonably be ex-\\npected to accompany a major change in allocation of \\nexecutive branch responsibilities across eight national forests in a fourteen-state region. The Trails Act makes \\nno mention of budget authority, personnel and prop-\\nerty reassignment, transition  schedule or process, re-\\nassignment of permits or easements. Indeed, the Trails \\nAct does not mention the Park Service except for the \\npurpose of maintaining a Trail map. See Whitman v. \\nAm. Trucking Ass'n , 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001) (\\\"Con-\\ngress . . . does not alter the fundamental details of a \\nregulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provi-sions\\u2014it does not, one might say, hide elephants in \\nmouseholes.\\\"). \\n Three other considerations strongly reinforce the \\nconclusion that the circuit court erred in interpreting \\n21 \\n the Trails Act. First , Congress had rejected at least \\neight proposals to transfer the national forests to the \\nInterior Department in the years preceding enactment \\nof the Trails Act, and it is highly unlikely that it would \\nhave transferred national forest lands sub silentio .27 \\nSecond , Congress has given significant consideration \\nto the question whether the relevant portions of the George Washington and Jefferson national forests \\ndeserved enhanced protection  from commercial develop-\\nment and has chosen not to do so, thus strongly indicat-ing that Congress would not have done indirectly by \\nimplication what it has de clined to do directly.\\n28 Third , \\n \\n 27 Ross W.

Roosevelt's administration related to potential trans-fer of national forest jurisdiction away from the Agriculture De-partment). \\n \\n28 Congress has considered the question whether the sections \\nof the Trail corridor at issue here merit special protection by the Forest Service. Congress has designated numerous sections of \\nGeorge Washington and Jefferson national forest  lands crossed \\nby the Appalachian Trail as wilderness under the Wilderness Act \\n \\n22 \\n numerous major interstate gas pipelines crossed the \\nlands used for the Trail at the time Congress approved \\nthe Trails Act.29 The interstate pipelines were then, as \\ntoday, subject to federal approval under the provisions of the Natural Gas Act. Had Congress sought to change \\nthe federal approval process for gas pipelines inter-\\nsecting the path of the Trail, it would have said some-thing, especially if the in tended change amounted to a \\nprohibition of federal rights-of-way. \\n \\nII. The Circuit Court's Holding Conflicts With \\nThis Court's Decisions On Harmonizing Potentially Confli cting Statutes. \\n The Fourth Circuit was faced with reconciling the \\nTrails Act with the Weeks Act to determine the ap-\\nplicability of the Mineral Leasing Act. The court mis-characterized the Trails Act in a way that presented an \\napparent conflict with the Weeks Act, which in turn vi-\\ntiated the Mineral Leasing Act. The court made no \\n \\nof 1964, 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1131-1136. See, e.g., Act of Oct. 30, 1984, \\nPub. L. No. 98-586, 98 Stat. 3105 (designating the Thunder Ridge, Mountain Lake, Peters Mountain, Beartown, Little Wilson Creek, \\nLewis Fork, Priest Wi lderness Areas in Virg inia). Congress has \\nnever found that the national forest lands proposed to be used for the Atlantic or MVP below-grade Trail crossings warrant wilder-ness protection. \\n \\n29 A 1968 map prepared by the Federal Power Commission, \\nFERC's predecessor agency charged with implementation of the Natural Gas Act, shows multiple major gas pipelines in the area \\nof the Trail. That map is included as Attachment A. Attachment B shows the approximate route of the Trail superimposed on the map by amicus  Mountain Valley using contemporary geographic \\ninformation system data for the Trail's current route. \\n23 \\n effort to interpret the Weeks Act in concert with the \\nTrails Act. By failing to even try to reconcile and har-\\nmonize the statutes, the Fourth Circuit transformed \\n\\\"from expounder[ ] of what the law is into policy-\\nmaker[ ] choosing what the law should be .\\\" Epic Sys. \\nCorp. v. Lewis , 138 S. Ct. 1612, 1624 (2018). \\n When \\\"confronted with two Acts of Congress alleg-\\nedly touching on the same topic, this Court is not at \\n'liberty to pick and choose among congressional enact-ments' and must instead strive 'to give effect to both.' \\\" \\nId. (quoting Morton v. Mancari , 417 U.S. 535, 551 \\n(1974)). The project challengers below bore a \\\"heavy burden\\\"\\u2014that was never met or even considered by \\nthe circuit court\\u2014to show that Congress implicitly dis-\\nplaced the controlling national forest-administration statutes through the 1968 Trails Act. See id . \\n The circuit court simply presumed  that the entire \\nalmost 2,200-mile long Trail corridor is land in the \\n\\\"National Park System\\\" because the Trail was generi-\\ncally referenced in the record as a \\\" 'unit' of the Na-tional Park System.\\\" Pet. App. 55a (No. 18-1584). But \\na shorthand labeling reference, useful to agency staff \\nresponding to an internal Interior Department delega-tion of responsibility to implement the Trails Act, does \\nnot itself transfer administration of all lands within \\nthe Trail corridor to the Park Service, change the language of the Trails Act, or even modify the Park \\nService's own longstanding administrative interpreta-\\ntion, application, and understanding of the Trails Act as reflected in the agency's management documents \\nand consistent practice. See FCC v. Fox TV Stations , \\n24 \\n 556 U.S. 502, 513-16 (2009); see also  Pet. at 24-25 (No. \\n18-1587); Pet. at 19-21 (No. 18-1584). \\n The circuit court's approach results in an implau-\\nsible reading of the Trails Act. Extending the Fourth \\nCircuit's reasoning to other national scenic trails, such \\nas the Continental Divide Trail, where the Trails Act assigns to the Secretary of Agriculture the trail-admin-\\nistration role, see 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1244(a)(5), would convert \\nnarrow strips of Yellowstone, Glacier, and Rocky Moun-tain national parks into national forests without any \\ncongressional action. The same would hold true for the \\nfive other national scenic or historic trails adminis-tered by the Forest Service, many of which also trav-\\nerse national park system lands.\\n30 Numerous other \\nnational scenic and historic trails are administered by \\nthe Park Service. The circuit court's decision, if applied \\nand followed nationwide, woul d elevate all those trails, \\n42,127 miles in all, to \\\"land in the National Park Sys-tem.\\\"\\n31 \\n--------------------------------- \\uf0a8 ---------------------------------  \\n \\n \\n 30 Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, Florida National Sce-\\nnic Trail, Nez Perce National Historic Trail, Arizona National Scenic Trail, and Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1244(a)(2), (13), (14), (27), (30). \\n \\n31 National Historic Trails , Nat'l Park Serv., https://www.nps. \\ngov/subjects/nationaltrailssystem/n ational-historic-trails.htm (last \\nvisited July 18, 2019).

The National Forest System': '. \\n In 1891, Congress authorized the President to \"set \\napart and reserve . . . public land bearing forests . . . as \\npublic reservations.\" Forest Reserve Act of 1891, ch. \\n561, § 24, 26 Stat. 1103 (codif ied at 16 U.S.C. § 471 \\n(repealed 1976)). In the Organic Administration Act \\nof 1897, Congress provided that \"[n]o national forest \\nshall be established, except to improve and protect the forest within the boundaries, or for the purpose of \\nsecuring favorable conditions of water flows, and to \\nfurnish a continuous supply of timber.\" Organic Ad-ministration Act of 1897, ch. 2, § 1, 30 Stat. 34 (codi-\\nfied at 16 U.S.C. § 475). In 1905, Congress transferred \\njurisdiction over the national forests from the Depart-ment of the Interior to the Department of Agriculture. \\nForest Transfer Act of 1905, ch. 288, § 1, 33 Stat. 628 \\n(codified as amended at 16 U.S.C. § 472). The Forest Transfer Act directs that \"the Department of Agricul-\\nture shall execute . . . all laws affecting public lands \\nheretofore or hereafter reserved\" as forest reserves under the 1891 Act. 16 U.S.C. § 472. These acts, ini-\\ntially focused on public lands in the western United \\n14 \\n States, established the foundation of the current na-\\ntional forest system. See 36 C.F.R. § 200.3(b)(2). \\n The 1911 Weeks Act then authorized the Secretary \\nof Agriculture to acquire pri vate lands to establish na-\\ntional forests in the eastern United States. Act of Mar. \\n1, 1911, ch. 186, § 9, 36 Stat. 962, § 6 (codified at 16 U.S.C. § 515).\\n21 Congress also directed that those lands \\nbe \"permanently reserved, held, and administered as \\nnational forest lands under the provisions of \" the 1891 Act as supplemented. 16 U.S.C. § 521; see also id . \\n§ 521a. Both the George Washington and Jefferson na-\\ntional forests were among th e first national forests es-\\ntablished pursuant to these authorities.\\n22 \\n From the beginning, national forests were to be \\nmanaged for \"multiple use,\" diverse public purposes \\nincluding commercial activi ties such as timber har-\\nvest, mining, grazing, and energy development. See, \\ne.g., United States v. New Mexico , 438 U.S. 696, 706-09 \\n& n.18 (1978); United States v.

The Act delegated re-\\nsponsibility to coordinate administration of the Appa-\\nlachian Trail to the Secretary of the Interior and gave \\nthe Secretary of Agriculture equivalent responsibility for the Pacific Crest Trail. Congress did not change the \\njurisdictional status of the lands over which the trails \\ncross. As Professor Fairfax explained, \"[i]rrespective of which Secretary has overa ll responsibility for a trail \\n[under the Trails Act], the Sec retary of the Interior is \\nin charge when a trail crosses Park or Bureau of Land Management lands and the Secr etary of Agriculture is \\nresponsible for management when a trail crosses For-\\nest Service land.\"\\n25 \\n The Trails Act recognizes that a federal agency \\nother than the agency charged with the overall ad-ministration of a trail may have authority and re-\\nsponsibility for the administration of the lands  over \\nwhich the trail traverses. The latter retains its author-ity to administer those l ands despite the trail\\'s pres-\\nence.

When Congress Transfers Administrative Jurisdiction From The Agriculture Department's Forest Service And The Interior Department's Park Service, It Does So Explicitly\": '. \\n The structure of the Trails  Act consistently reflects \\nCongress\\'s intent that federal agency land manage-\\nment jurisdiction be left undisturbed. The \"Secretary \\ncharged with the administration of a national scenic . . . trail may relocate segments of a national scenic . . . \\ntrail right-of-way,\" but only \" with the concurrence of \\nthe head of the Federal agency having jurisdiction over the lands involved .\" 16 U.S.C. § 1246(b) (emphasis \\nadded). The Secretary \"may issue regulations,\" but \\nonly \" with the concurrence of the heads of any other \\nFederal agencies administering lands through which a \\n. . . national scenic . . . trail passes .\" Id. § 1246(i) (em-\\nphasis added). \\n Congress elsewhere consistently has been explicit \\nwhen it intends to transfe r jurisdiction from one fed-\\neral agency to ano ther. On the same day he signed the \\nTrails Act, President John son signed legislation es-\\ntablishing North Cascades National Park. That con-\\ntemporaneous legislation expressly transferred the \\nadministrative jurisdiction of lands from the national \\nforest system to the National Park System: \\nFederal property within the boundaries of the \\npark and recreation areas is hereby trans-ferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the \\nSecretary [of the Interior] for administration \\nby him as part of the park and recreation \\n19 \\n areas. The national forest land within such \\nboundaries is hereby eliminated from the na-\\ntional forests within which it was heretofore \\nlocated.  \\nAct of Jan. 15, 1968, Pub. L. No. 90-544, 82 Stat. 926 \\n(codified at 16 U.S.C. § 90b(a)) (emphasis added).26 \\n Similarly, when establishing Great Basin National \\nPark some years later, Cong ress specified that \"[l]ands \\nand waters . . . within the boundaries of the park which \\nwere administered by the Forest Service . . . prior to \\n[the date of enactment of this Act] are hereby trans-ferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secre-\\ntary [of the Interior].\" 16 U.S.C. § 410mm-2; see also 16 \\nU.S.C. § 192b-9 (boundary adjustments for Rocky Mountain National Park). \\n Two examples from the Appalachian Trail area \\nfurther demonstrate that when Congress puts land \\ninto a national park system unit, it says so. See 16 \\nU.S.C. § 403k-1 (\"Subject to valid existing rights, all lands within the boundaries of Great Smoky Moun-\\ntains National Park . . . hereafter shall be a part of the \\n \\n 26 In President Johnson\\'s remarks on signing the Trails Act, \\nhe stated that \"[o]ur history of wise management of America\\'s na-tional forests has assisted us in designating the initial elements of the National Trails System. . . . : the Appalachian Trail and the \\nPacific Crest Trail.\" Presidential Remarks Upon Signing Four Bills Relating to Conservation and Outdoor Recreation, 2 Pub. Papers 1000, 1001 (Oct. 2, 1968). H ad the Trails Act involved an \\nextensive jurisdictional transfer of national forest system land to the Park Service for the Appalachian Trail, it would have been unusual for the President to invoke the history of America\\'s na-\\ntional forest  management as an impetus for designating the Trail. \\n20 \\n national park and shall be subject to all laws, rules, \\nand regulations applicable to the national park.\"); 16 \\nU.S.C. § 403-3 (\"Subject to valid existing rights, the \\nlands and interests in lands which comprise section 1-A of the Blue Ridge Parkway . . . are excluded from the \\nparkway, made a part of the Shenandoah National \\nPark, and shall be administer ed in accordance with the \\nAct of August 25, 1916 (39 Stat. 535; 16 U.S.C. 1-4).\"). \\n Such jurisdictional transfer language is conspicu-\\nously absent from the Trails Act. Simply put, had Con-\\ngress intended to convert the Trail corridor lands into \\nlands of the National Park System, it would have said so. Any uncertainty over the significance of the absence \\nof transfer language should have been put to rest by \\nthe fact that the Trails Act lacks any of the other or-ganizational provisions that might reasonably be ex-\\npected to accompany a major change in allocation of \\nexecutive branch responsibilities across eight national forests in a fourteen-state region. The Trails Act makes \\nno mention of budget authority, personnel and prop-\\nerty reassignment, transition  schedule or process, re-\\nassignment of permits or easements. Indeed, the Trails \\nAct does not mention the Park Service except for the \\npurpose of maintaining a Trail map. See Whitman v. \\nAm. Trucking Ass\\'n , 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001) (\"Con-\\ngress . . . does not alter the fundamental details of a \\nregulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provi-sions—it does not, one might say, hide elephants in \\nmouseholes.\"). \\n Three other considerations strongly reinforce the \\nconclusion that the circuit court erred in interpreting \\n21 \\n the Trails Act. First , Congress had rejected at least \\neight proposals to transfer the national forests to the \\nInterior Department in the years preceding enactment \\nof the Trails Act, and it is highly unlikely that it would \\nhave transferred national forest lands sub silentio .27 \\nSecond , Congress has given significant consideration \\nto the question whether the relevant portions of the George Washington and Jefferson national forests \\ndeserved enhanced protection  from commercial develop-\\nment and has chosen not to do so, thus strongly indicat-ing that Congress would not have done indirectly by \\nimplication what it has de clined to do directly.\\n28 Third , \\n \\n 27 Ross W. Gorte, Cong. Research Serv., RL34772, Proposals \\nto Merge the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management: Issues and Approaches  CRS-14 (2008) (\"Proposals to transfer the \\nFS to DOI or the BLM to USDA, or to merge the FS and BLM (or \\nits predecessor), date back to 1911, and have been made under Presidents Taft, Harding, Hoover, Roosevelt, Truman, Eisen-hower, Nixon, Carter, and Clinto n. In an attempt to improve ad-\\nministration of the federal lands, President Reagan proposed a substantial exchange (consolidation) of lands and personnel be-tween the agencies, but even this more limited reorganization was prevented by Cong ress.\"); U.S. Gov\\'t Accountability Off., \\nGAO-09-223, Federal Land Management: Observations on a Pos-\\nsible Move of the Forest Service in to the Department of the Interior  \\n56-61 (2009); see also  T.H.

Roosevelt\\'s administration related to potential trans-fer of national forest jurisdiction away from the Agriculture De-partment). \\n \\n28 Congress has considered the question whether the sections \\nof the Trail corridor at issue here merit special protection by the Forest Service. Congress has designated numerous sections of \\nGeorge Washington and Jefferson national forest  lands crossed \\nby the Appalachian Trail as wilderness under the Wilderness Act \\n \\n22 \\n numerous major interstate gas pipelines crossed the \\nlands used for the Trail at the time Congress approved \\nthe Trails Act.29 The interstate pipelines were then, as \\ntoday, subject to federal approval under the provisions of the Natural Gas Act. Had Congress sought to change \\nthe federal approval process for gas pipelines inter-\\nsecting the path of the Trail, it would have said some-thing, especially if the in tended change amounted to a \\nprohibition of federal rights-of-way.'}\n",

      "{\"II. The Circuit Court's Holding Conflicts With This Court's Decisions On Harmonizing Potentially Conflicting Statutes\": '. \\n The Fourth Circuit was faced with reconciling the \\nTrails Act with the Weeks Act to determine the ap-\\nplicability of the Mineral Leasing Act. The court mis-characterized the Trails Act in a way that presented an \\napparent conflict with the Weeks Act, which in turn vi-\\ntiated the Mineral Leasing Act. The court made no \\n \\nof 1964, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1131-1136. See, e.g., Act of Oct. 30, 1984, \\nPub. L. No. 98-586, 98 Stat. 3105 (designating the Thunder Ridge, Mountain Lake, Peters Mountain, Beartown, Little Wilson Creek, \\nLewis Fork, Priest Wi lderness Areas in Virg inia). Congress has \\nnever found that the national forest lands proposed to be used for the Atlantic or MVP below-grade Trail crossings warrant wilder-ness protection. \\n \\n29 A 1968 map prepared by the Federal Power Commission, \\nFERC\\'s predecessor agency charged with implementation of the Natural Gas Act, shows multiple major gas pipelines in the area \\nof the Trail. That map is included as Attachment A. Attachment B shows the approximate route of the Trail superimposed on the map by amicus  Mountain Valley using contemporary geographic \\ninformation system data for the Trail\\'s current route. \\n23 \\n effort to interpret the Weeks Act in concert with the \\nTrails Act. By failing to even try to reconcile and har-\\nmonize the statutes, the Fourth Circuit transformed \\n\"from expounder[ ] of what the law is into policy-\\nmaker[ ] choosing what the law should be .\" Epic Sys. \\nCorp. v. Lewis , 138 S. Ct. 1612, 1624 (2018). \\n When \"confronted with two Acts of Congress alleg-\\nedly touching on the same topic, this Court is not at \\n\\'liberty to pick and choose among congressional enact-ments\\' and must instead strive \\'to give effect to both.\\' \" \\nId. (quoting Morton v. Mancari , 417 U.S. 535, 551 \\n(1974)). The project challengers below bore a \"heavy burden\"—that was never met or even considered by \\nthe circuit court—to show that Congress implicitly dis-\\nplaced the controlling national forest-administration statutes through the 1968 Trails Act. See id . \\n The circuit court simply presumed  that the entire \\nalmost 2,200-mile long Trail corridor is land in the \\n\"National Park System\" because the Trail was generi-\\ncally referenced in the record as a \" \\'unit\\' of the Na-tional Park System.\" Pet. App. 55a (No. 18-1584). But \\na shorthand labeling reference, useful to agency staff \\nresponding to an internal Interior Department delega-tion of responsibility to implement the Trails Act, does \\nnot itself transfer administration of all lands within \\nthe Trail corridor to the Park Service, change the language of the Trails Act, or even modify the Park \\nService\\'s own longstanding administrative interpreta-\\ntion, application, and understanding of the Trails Act as reflected in the agency\\'s management documents \\nand consistent practice. See FCC v. Fox TV Stations , \\n24 \\n 556 U.S. 502, 513-16 (2009); see also  Pet. at 24-25 (No. \\n18-1587); Pet. at 19-21 (No. 18-1584). \\n The circuit court\\'s approach results in an implau-\\nsible reading of the Trails Act. Extending the Fourth \\nCircuit\\'s reasoning to other national scenic trails, such \\nas the Continental Divide Trail, where the Trails Act assigns to the Secretary of Agriculture the trail-admin-\\nistration role, see 16 U.S.C. § 1244(a)(5), would convert \\nnarrow strips of Yellowstone, Glacier, and Rocky Moun-tain national parks into national forests without any \\ncongressional action. The same would hold true for the \\nfive other national scenic or historic trails adminis-tered by the Forest Service, many of which also trav-\\nerse national park system lands.\\n30 Numerous other \\nnational scenic and historic trails are administered by \\nthe Park Service. The circuit court\\'s decision, if applied \\nand followed nationwide, woul d elevate all those trails, \\n42,127 miles in all, to \"land in the National Park Sys-tem.\"\\n31 \\n--------------------------------- \\uf0a8 ---------------------------------  \\n \\n \\n 30 Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, Florida National Sce-\\nnic Trail, Nez Perce National Historic Trail, Arizona National Scenic Trail, and Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail. 16 U.S.C. § 1244(a)(2), (13), (14), (27), (30). \\n \\n31 National Historic Trails , Nat\\'l Park Serv., https://www.nps. \\ngov/subjects/nationaltrailssystem/n ational-historic-trails.htm (last \\nvisited July 18, 2019).

      "INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY \n",
      "I. The rule of lenity has an important role to  \n",
      "play in the interpretation of mandatory minimum sentencing statutes and shou ld be given special force \n",
      "in cases that involve them.  Mandatory minimum \n",
      "sentencing statutes pose special threats to individual liberty and the separation of powers.  Experience \n",
      "teaches that such statut e s  l e a d  t o  s e v e r e  a n d  \n",
      "disproportionate sentences, reallocate power from \n",
      "legislators and judges to prosecutors, and often \n",
      "ultimately fail to achieve their ostensible goal of \n",
      "sentencing uniformity.  Experience also teaches that \n",
      "such statutes are poorly drafted and difficult to \n",
      "apply.  Because the costs of overreading harsh \n",
      "sentencing statutes are high , lenity counsels in favor \n",
      "of narrower reading. \n",
      " 3 \n",
      "A. The most obvious cost of error in overreading a  \n",
      "mandatory minimum sentencing statute is the lost liberty of individuals who receive a far longer prison term than the legislature actually intended.  Lenity \n",
      "embodies the courts' \"instinctive distaste[] against \n",
      "men languishing in prison unless the lawmaker has \n",
      "clearly said they should.\"  Henry J. Friendly, \"Mr. \n",
      "Justice Frankfurter and the Reading of Statutes,\" in \n",
      "Benchmarks  196, 209 (1967).  A mandatory 15-year \n",
      "sentence based on less-than-certain evidence of \n",
      "legislative intent is indeed distasteful.  Mandatory \n",
      "minimum statutes like the one here also reflect moral condemnation for a special subgroup of criminals – as \n",
      "shown by Congress's decision to pass an \"Armed \n",
      "Career Criminal Act\" (\"ACCA\") – that should follow \n",
      "only from a genuine legislative decision. \n",
      "Mandatory minimum sentencing statutes also \n",
      "impair courts' efforts to achieve the important goals \n",
      "of fairness and proportionate punishment.  Although Congress has the power (within constitutional \n",
      "bounds) to sacrifice fairness and proportionality to a \n",
      "perceived greater good, courts should not conclude \n",
      "that Congress has done so based on guesswork or \n",
      "speculation about the meaning of an unclear statute.  \n",
      "Often, mandatory minimum sentencing statutes fail \n",
      "to achieve the goal of sentencing uniformity because they place great power in the hands of prosecutors, \n",
      "thus inviting inconsistent and arbitrary application.  \n",
      "Applying the rule of lenity rigorously to such statutes \n",
      "lessens those costs to the system and ensures that \n",
      "they are imposed only when Congress has truly \n",
      "found them justified. \n",
      "By contrast, erring on the side of narrow \n",
      "constructions for mandatory minimum statutes is \n",
      "less risky.  Most importantly, judges always retain \n",
      "power to sentence up to the statutory maximum or to \n",
      " 4 \n",
      "run sentences for multiple offenses consecutively.  \n",
      "They do not need mandatory minimums to determine \n",
      "appropriate sentences based on the nature of an \n",
      "offense or the history and characteristics of an \n",
      "offender.  Moreover, the go vernment is well situated \n",
      "to press for new legislation if dissatisfied with the \n",
      "courts' interpretation.  There is no reason to doubt \n",
      "that prosecutors will call for stronger criminal penalties in response to any true threat to public \n",
      "safety or that legislators will fail to answer such calls. \n",
      "B. The risk of error is particularly acute when \n",
      "courts interpret mandatory minimum sentencing statutes.  As this Court knows all too well, Congress \n",
      "often writes such statutes in a confusing way.  The \n",
      "statutory provision here resulted from a rare \n",
      "confession of error by the Solicitor General that, in \n",
      "essence, Congress had left needed language out of a 15-year sentencing statute and so had inflicted a \n",
      "harsher and broader penalty than anyone involved  \n",
      "in the statute's creation (the Justice Department \n",
      "included) had anticipated.  This Court's recent cases \n",
      "have invalidated other parts of § 924 as unconsti-\n",
      "tutionally vague, and over the years the Court has \n",
      "remarked on similar problems with other mandatory minimum sentencing statutes.  When Congress \n",
      "enacts mandatory minimum sentencing statutes  \n",
      "with enormous effects on future defendants, but \n",
      "gives little consideration to statutory details, the rule \n",
      "of lenity provides a much-needed safeguard for \n",
      "individual liberty. \n",
      "II. The rule of lenity confirms that this Court \n",
      "should reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.  \n",
      "Petitioner Wooden correctly argues that 18 U.S.C. \n",
      "§ 924(e) should be read in his favor even without the \n",
      "rule of lenity.  If any doubt remains, lenity should \n",
      "dispose of it.  That conclusion is further supported  \n",
      " 5 \n",
      "by examining judicial experience with cases under \n",
      "§ 924(e)(1).  The standard endorsed by the court of \n",
      "appeals – under which even a moment's separation \n",
      "between two prior offenses qualifies them as \n",
      "occurring on different occasions – has led to \n",
      "inconsistent results, arbitrary distinctions, and \n",
      "repeated judicial observations about confusion and \n",
      "uncertainty in the statutory scheme. \n",
      "A. One recurring type of situation involves \n",
      "burglaries of related or adjacent structures or dwellings.  Examples include the mini-warehouses at \n",
      "issue here; a group of adjacent storage units at the same street address in United States v. Carr , 592 \n",
      "F.3d 636 (4th Cir. 2010); and three businesses in a \n",
      "single strip mall in United States v. Hudspeth , 42 \n",
      "F.3d 1015 (7th Cir. 1994) (en banc), abrogated on \n",
      "other grounds by Shepard v. United States , 544 U.S. \n",
      "13 (2005).  Whether assessed against the constitu-tional right to fair warnin g or the legislature's sole \n",
      "responsibility under the Constitution to define \n",
      "crimes, the statute does no t clearly classify several \n",
      "break-ins in the course of a day or an hour as prior \n",
      "offenses on \"occasions different from one another.\"  \n",
      "Accordingly, the statute should not be construed to \n",
      "mandate 15 years in prison by treating such offenses \n",
      "as separate violent felonies.  \n",
      "B. Another situation that repeatedly arises under \n",
      "§ 924(e) is an offense co mmitted while the defendant \n",
      "evades or resists arrest for another offense.  \n",
      "Examples include pushing a police officer after \n",
      "committing a robbery, United States v. Schieman , \n",
      "894 F.2d 909 (7th Cir. 1990); fleeing a police officer \n",
      "after a traffic stop that interrupted a domestic \n",
      "assault, United States v. Davidson , 527 F.3d 703  \n",
      "(8th Cir. 2008), vacated in part on other grounds ,  \n",
      "551 F.3d 807 (8th Cir. 2008) (per curiam); and \n",
      " 6 \n",
      "committing two assaults in the course of a single \n",
      "high-speed chase, Levering v. United States , 890 F.3d \n",
      "738 (8th Cir. 2018).  The decisions applying § 924(e) to these situations acknowledge confusion and \n",
      "judicial disagreement, with some courts ruling that any separation of time between the onset of two \n",
      "offenses supports a finding that they occurred on different occasions.  No such rule can be clearly \n",
      "derived from the present statute using ordinary rules \n",
      "of statutory construction.  The courts of appeals should instead have followed the tradition of lenity to \n",

While debating the extent to \\nwhich the Constitution should enshrine protections for religious freedom during the First Congress, \\nRepresentative Daniel Carroll of Maryland\\u2014one of \\nthe few Catholics among the Constitution\\u2019s \\nFramers\\u2014remarked \\u201cthe rights of conscience are, in \\ntheir nature, of peculiar delicacy, and will little bear \\nthe gentlest touch of governmental hand.\\u201d 1 Annals \\nof Cong. 757-58 (Joseph Gales ed., 1834) (Aug. 15, 1789). \\nNowhere are the rights of the religious more \\ndelicate than when they intersect with the freedom \\nto put faith into action, belief into words. If the \\nrobust religious freedom protections guaranteed by \\nour Constitution are to have any meaning, they must \\nbe capable of shielding a sincere religious believer from being coerced into speaking against the core \\ntenants of her faith. To hold otherwise would be to \\npermit the heavy hand of government to extinguish \\nreligious practice. This the Constitution will not \\nallow. \\nThe Founders understood that the First \\nAmendment, as drafted, protected all religious sects in their right to speak freely in accordance with their \\nfaith. Indeed, the Founding Generation believed \\nprotections for religious lib erty to be of utmost \\nimport. Since its founding, America has been gripped \\n 3 \\nin debate over religious liberty. Even before the \\ncolonies declared their independence, there were \\nenergetic discussions over the bounds of religious \\ntoleration versus a full freedom to exercise religion \\n(with only limited exceptions). Ultimately, the \\nConstitution\\u2019s drafters settled on James Madison\\u2019s \\nview of an unalienable right to practice one\\u2019s \\nreligious faith. Owed to an understanding that the Governor of the Universe supersedes any earthly \\nauthority, religious convictions were understood to \\ncommand greater deference than mere personal \\nopinions. Where opinion was required to yield to the \\nlaw, tensions between law and religious belief often \\nresulted in exemption for the believer. \\nThe Founding Generation also viewed religious \\nliberty as encompassing more  than mere matters of \\nconscience or decisions on the rightness or wrongness \\nof acts. Instead, the full ex ercise of religion offered a \\nright to act in accordance with one\\u2019s faith and, \\nnecessarily, included protection from government \\ncompelled speech that violated a believer\\u2019s firmly \\nheld religious convictions. This distinction was \\nperhaps most clearly expressed in the early colonies\\u2019 \\nanti-Catholic prejudices. In colonial Georgia, for example, while all worshipers were vested by its \\nCharter with a liberty of conscience, Catholics were \\nexpressly excluded from protections for the more \\nrobust free exercise of religion. McConnell, The \\nOrigins and Historical Understanding of Free \\nExercise of Religion, 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1409, 1489-90 \\n(1989) (hereinafter McConnell, Origins). \\nInformed by the debates and experiences of their \\ntime, the Founders opted to include among the Constitution\\u2019s protections the more extensive free \\n 4 \\nexercise of religion. In so doing, they extended the \\nmaximum protections available to all who professed \\nbelief in a Universal Sovereign. These protections, it \\nwas understood, included a right to act out belief and \\nto speak, or refrain from speaking, freely, in \\naccordance with faith. \\nWith this understanding as background, it is \\nclear the First Amendment provides dual protections for religious expression (or non-expression) in its \\nguarantees of free speech and free religious exercise. \\nThis reality compels the conclusion that religious \\nspeech enjoys the highest constitutional protection. \\nCertainly, this is consistent with the Founders\\u2019 \\nunderstanding of robust religious liberty protections, \\nas revealed in the text, history, and tradition of the First Amendment. \\nThis Court\\u2019s recent religious liberty jurisprudence \\nconcurs with the Founders\\u2019 view of full-throated \\nreligious liberty protection. Religious observers have \\nwelcomed the relief from government oppression. No \\nlonger can religious believers be excluded solely \\nbecause of their religious identity. Free are the religious to express their religious views without fear \\nof government reprisal. This Court\\u2019s precedents have \\nbeen unequivocal: if government can achieve its \\nmeans without burdening religion, the Constitution \\nalmost always requires that it must. \\nAnother truism is derived from this Court\\u2019s \\nprecedents. When religious liberty concerns are coupled with free expression, the Constitution \\ndemands the most exacting scrutiny. That is because \\nthe First Amendment, as understood from the \\nFounding, provides special protection for the \\n 5 \\nreligious, their right to speak freely, and their right \\nto refrain from speaking. Distinct from pure \\ncommercial speech, religious speech demands a \\nhigher constitutional protection. That is why, to \\nAmicus Curiae\\u2019s knowledge, government compelled \\nreligious speech has never been held to survive strict \\nscrutiny. \\nAgainst this backdrop, the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s opinion \\ncannot stand. Although purporting to apply strict scrutiny, the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s analysis is rife with \\nflaws, each one fatal to the court\\u2019s conclusion. From \\nthe outset, the Tenth Circuit failed to recognize the \\npreferred status of Ms. Smith\\u2019s free speech rights, \\ngrounded as they are in her religious beliefs. This \\nfailure is only compounded by the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s lethargic narrow-tailoring analysis. Far from the \\nexacting analysis this Court requires, the Tenth \\nCircuit settles into a now familiar pattern to those of \\nfaith\\u2014ostracizing Ms. Smith from society because of \\nher religious identity. \\nOnce again, this Court must reverse yet another \\nassault on religious freedom by declaring that where, as here, free speech and religion intersect, \\nconstitutional protections are at their greatest. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 6 \\nARGUMENT \\nI. AS ORIGINALLY UNDERSTOOD , THE FIRST \\nAMENDMENT PROTECTED THE RIGHT OF THE \\nRELIGIOUS TO SPEAK AND TO REMAIN SILENT . \\nThe First Amendment is \\u201cunique in form among \\namendments to the Constitution.\\u201d2 It is drafted, not \\nas a grant of privileges or rights to the people, but as \\na disability on Congress\\u2019 ability to act. Report to the Attorney General, supra  note 2, at 15\\u201316. In its \\nentirety, the First Amendment reads: \\nCongress shall make no law respecting \\nan establishment of religion, or \\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; or \\nabridging the freedom of speech, or of \\nthe press; or the right of the people \\npeaceably to assemble, and to petition \\nthe Government for a redress of grievances.  \\nU.S.\\n Const., Amdt. 1. \\nIn barring certain kinds of laws, the First \\nAmendment recognizes a pre-existing \\u201cimmun[ity] from such legislative action.\\u201d Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral, supra note 2, at 16. This reflects an \\nunderstanding by the Founding Generation that these \\u201care pre-existent rights\\u2014inalienable rights\\u2014\\n                                           \\n2 O f f i c e  o f  L e g a l  P o l i c y ,  D e p t  o f  J u s t i c e ,  R e p o r t  t o  t h e  \\nAttorney General: Religious Li berty Under the Free Exercise \\nClause at 15 (1986) (hereinafter Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral). \\n 7 \\nand not mere civil privileges conferred by a \\nbenevolent sovereign.\\u201d Id. \\nTaken together, the text, history, and philosophy \\nof the First Amendment establish the principle that \\n\\u201cthe government has no right to interfere with the \\nfree exercise of religion\\u201d unless the \\u201cgovernment \\naction is necessary to prevent manifest danger to the \\nexistence of the state; to protect public peace, safety, \\nand order; or to secure the religious liberty of \\nothers.\\u201d Id., at v. And, even then, only if the \\ngovernment deploys \\u201cthe least restrictive means \\nnecessary to protect these interests.\\u201d Id. This is true \\nas a matter of the First Amendment\\u2019s Religious Liberty Clauses. And because freedom of religion \\ncannot be divorced from freedom of expression, it is \\neven more true when the government tries to force a \\nbeliever to speak in a way that cannot be reconciled \\nwith her religious convictions. \\nA. Religious liberty was profoundly \\nimportant to the Founding Generation; \\nreligious convictions were understood \\nto receive greater deference than mere \\npersonal opinion. \\n1. The Founding Generation was uniquely \\nattuned to issues regarding the proper relationship \\nbetween religion and government. Indeed, at the time of America\\u2019s founding there was \\u201can intense and \\ncontroversial theoretical debate\\u201d of these issues \\ninvolving \\u201c[m]ost of the great political thinkers of the \\nperiod.\\u201d McConnell, Origins, at 1430. These thinkers \\ninformed the Founders\\u2019 own debates on the issue and \\nundoubtedly \\u201cinfluenced the American solution to \\nthe problem.\\u201d Id.  \\n 8 \\nJohn Locke, perhaps more than any other \\nphilosopher who contributed to the ideas \\nunderpinning America\\u2019s founding, provided the \\n\\u201cmost extensive\\u201d discussion of religion and most \\ndirectly influenced the Framers\\u2019 drafting of the First \\nAmendment. Id. Locke was an early and influential \\ntheoretical thinker and advocate for religious freedom. Id., at 1431. In his view \\u201creligious rivalry \\nand intolerance\\u201d were \\u201camong the most important of political problems,\\u201d and \\u201c[r]eligious intolerance was inconsistent both with public peace and with good \\ngovernment.\\u201d Id. \\nLocke\\u2019s solution, however, was an \\u201cunderstanding \\nof religious toleration,\\u201d that \\u201cexpressly precludes free \\nexercise exemptions.\\u201d Id., at 1435. To Locke, when \\n\\u201cindividual conscience conflicts with the governmental policy, the government will always \\nprevail and the individual will always be forced to \\nsubmit or suffer the punishment.\\u201d Id. Locke\\u2019s \\ninfluence on the drafters of the First Amendment makes it all the more remarkable that his view did \\nnot triumph with America\\u2019s founding. \\nThe American Revolution upended the \\npreexisting relationship between religion and government, especially in states where the Anglican \\nChurch had the most influence. Id., at 1436. \\n\\u201cAmerica was in the wake of a great religious \\nrevival,\\u201d that brought with it a \\u201cdrive for religious \\nfreedom.\\u201d Id., at 1437\\u201338. Along with this drive came \\na push from \\u201creligious supporters of disestablishment and free exercise\\u201d to enshrine \\n\\u201cconstitutional protections\\u201d for religious freedoms \\u201cat the federal level.\\u201d Id., at 1440. \\n 9 \\nThis movement was encapsulated in debate \\nsurrounding the religious liberty clause in Virginia\\u2019s \\n1776 Bill of Rights. When George Mason proposed \\nusing the Lockean phrase \\u201ctoleration of religion,\\u201d \\nJames Madison objected, complaining that the \\nphrase implied an act of legislative grace (which, to \\nLocke, it did). Id. , at 1443. Madison was not alone \\namong the Founding Generation in rejecting this concept. George Washin gton and Thomas Paine \\nsimilarly eschewed \\u201ctoleration,\\u201d decrying its \\nimplication of government \\u201cindulgence\\u201d rather than a \\nfundamental, preexisting right. Id., at 1443\\u201344. \\nMoreover, Madison objected to Mason\\u2019s proposal \\nbecause it excepted from even the \\u201ctoleration\\u201d of \\nreligious freedom any instance where \\u201cunder color of \\nreligion any man disturb the peace, the happiness, or \\nsafety of society.\\u201d See G. Hunt, James Madison and \\nReligious Liberty, 1 Ann. Rep. Am. Hist. A. 163, 166 \\n(1901). It was Madison\\u2019s belief that such phrasing \\n\\u201cmight easily be so twisted as to oppress religious \\nsects under the excuse that they disturbed \\u2018the \\npeace, the happiness, or safety of society.\\u2019\\u201d Id. \\nMadison\\u2019s objections were heard by Virginia\\u2019s \\nassembly. As adopted, Virginia\\u2019s Bill of Rights \\npromised that all \\u201care equally entitled to the free \\nexercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience,\\u201d and reminded only \\u201cthat\\n it is the mutual \\nduty of all to practice Christian forbearance, love, and charity towards each other.\\u201d Report to the \\nAttorney General, supra  note 2, at 102\\u201303. \\n2. This early debate between Madison and Mason \\nbears witness to what this Court has long noted\\u2014\\nthat Madison was \\u201cthe leading architect of the \\n 10\\nreligion clauses of the First Amendment.\\u201d Hosanna-\\nTabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v. \\nEEOC , 565 U.S. 171, 184 (2012) (internal quotation \\nmarks omitted). Madison\\u2019s rejection of religious \\ntolerance in favor of full and free religious expression permeates his Memorial and Remonstrance . \\nExplaining that \\u201c[t]he Religion then of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every \\nman,\\u201d Madison understood that it is not just \\u201cthe \\nright of every man to exercise it as these may \\ndictate,\\u201d but further \\u201cthe duty of every man to render \\nto the Creator such homage, and such only, as he \\nbelieves to be acceptable to him.\\u201d J. Madison, \\nMemorial and Remonstrance \\u00a7 1 (1785), reprinted in \\nEverson v. Bd. of Educ. , 330 U.S. 1, 64 (1947). This \\nright, Madison admonished, \\u201cis in its nature an unalienable right.\\u201d Id. \\nMadison expounded his view that \\u201c[t]his duty is \\nprecedent both in order of time and degree of \\nobligation, to the claims of Civil Society.\\u201d Id. Before \\nanyone is \\u201ca member of Civil Society,\\u201d they are \\u201cconsidered as a subject of the Governor of the \\nUniverse.\\u201d Id. For this reason, \\u201cin matters of \\nReligion, no man\\u2019s right is abridged by the institution of Civil Society.\\u201d Id. But Madison went \\nfurther. \\u201c[I]f religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that \\nof the Legislative Body.\\u201d Id., at \\u00a7 2, reprinted in \\nEverson , 330 U.S., at 65. Legislators who \\n\\u201cencroach[]\\u201d on the rights of the people, Madison \\nsaid, \\u201cexceed the commission from which they derive their authority, and are Tyrants.\\u201d Id. \\nRecognizing that Madison\\u2019s Memorial and \\nRemonstrance is not law, see City of Boerne v. Flores , \\n 11\\n521 U.S. 507, 541 (1997) (Scalia, J., concurring), it \\nnonetheless offers a clear understanding of why the \\nFounding Generation thought it so crucial to \\nmemorialize the inalienable freedom of religion in \\nthe First Amendment. And Madison\\u2019s defense of the \\nAmerican conception of religious liberty merely \\nechoed the prevalent thought at the founding \\u201cof the \\ndifference between religious faith and other forms of human judgment.\\u201d McConnell, Origins, at 1496. \\nAt the Founding, the prevailing view was that the \\n\\u201copinions of individuals\\u201d can not take \\u201cprecedence \\nover the decisions of civil society.\\u201d Id. The same was \\nnot true for religious convictions. \\u201cConflicts arising from religious convictions were conceived not as a \\nclash between the judgment of the individual and of \\nthe state, but as a conflict between earthly and \\nspiritual sovereigns.\\u201d Id. In those instances, the \\nperson holding the religious conviction \\u201cwas not seen as the instigator of the conflict; the believer was simply caught between the inconsistent demands of \\ntwo rightful authorities, through no fault of his own.\\u201d \\nId. This view is essential to understanding the \\nFounders\\u2019 belief that \\u201cfreedom of religion is unalienable because it is a duty to God and not a \\nprivilege of the individual.\\u201d Id., at 1497. \\n3. Bolstering this understanding, the historical \\nrecord surrounding adoption of the Bill of Rights \\nsuggests that the First Amendment\\u2019s use of the term \\u201creligion\\u201d was a deliberate choice. See McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1488. Although \\u201c[t]he recorded debates \\nin\\u201d both chambers of Congress \\u201ccast little light on the \\nmeaning of the free exercise clause,\\u201d looking at \\nsuccessive drafts of the clause from its consideration \\nand debate in the First Congress are especially \\n 12\\nenlightening. Id., at 1481, 1483. While earlier drafts \\nof the First Amendment used the phrase \\u201crights of \\nconscience,\\u201d the final version that emerged enshrined in the First Amendment a protection for the \\u201cfree \\nexercise of religion.\\u201d Id., at 1488. This phrasing lends \\nfurther support to the Founders\\u2019 understanding of religious freedoms. \\nTo the Founders, \\u201c[b]elief in a Supreme Being \\nwas\\u201d essential to \\u201creligion.\\u201d Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral, supra  note 2, at 9. Indeed, \\u201c[t]he historical \\nmaterials uniformly equate \\u2018religion\\u2019 with belief in God or in gods.\\u201d McConnell, Origins, at 1493. These references \\u201ccan be extended without distortion to \\ntranscendent extrapersonal authorities not \\nenvisioned in traditionally theistic terms\\u201d\\u2014for \\nexample, Madison\\u2019s use of \\u201cCreator,\\u201d \\u201cGovernor of \\nthe Universe,\\u201d and \\u201cUniversal Sovereign,\\u201d imply \\u201can attempt at a definition more compendious than the \\nfamiliar Judeo-Christian God, but it retains the distinction between transcendent authority and \\npersonal judgment.\\u201d Id.  \\nReligion, as understood by the Founders and \\nexpressed in the First Amendment, then, is best \\ndefined to encompass \\u201ca system of beliefs, whether \\npersonally or institutionally held, prompted by the \\nacceptance of transcendent realities or \\nacknowledging extratemporal actions.\\u201d Report to the \\nAttorney General, supra note 2, at 26\\u201327. This \\ninterpretation of religion is both accurate to the Founders\\u2019 understanding and consistent with their view that religion encompasses \\u201cduties that were \\nbeyond the jurisdiction of the state either to \\nprescribe or to proscribe.\\u201d Id., at 9. To the Founders, \\nreligion encompassed a subservience to a \\n 13\\n\\u201ctranscendent reality,\\u201d which if abandoned could \\nunleash \\u201cextratemporal consequences.\\u201d Id., at 29. \\nThis explains their motivation to preserve a robust freedom from government \\u201cinterfere[nce] with such \\nbeliefs or duties.\\u201d Id. \\nB. The Founding Generation\\u2019s understanding of religious liberty \\nencompassed protection for believers \\nfrom compelled speech that violates \\nfirmly held religious beliefs. \\n1. The least controversial point about the phrase \\n\\u201cfree exercise\\u201d is that \\u201cby definition, the words denote action or activity.\\u201d Id., at 19. To the Founders, \\nreligious liberty undoubtedly included \\u201creligiously motivated conduct  as well as belief.\\u201d McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1488 (emphasis added). This point bears emphasis because of this Court\\u2019s history rejecting \\nsuch a reading. See  Reynolds v. United States , 98 \\nU.S. 145, 164 (1878); but see Fulton v. City of Phila. , \\n141 S. Ct. 1868, 1913 (2021) (Alito, J., concurring) \\n(noting \\u201c[t]he Court ha[s] repudiated that distinction\\u201d in Reynolds  \\u201cthat the Free Exercise \\nClause protects beliefs, not conduct\\u201d). \\nIn substituting the \\u201crights of conscience\\u201d in favor \\nof a protection for the \\u201cfree exercise of religion,\\u201d the \\nFramer\\u2019s chose a phrase that \\u201cstrongly connoted \\naction,\\u201d in place of one that suggested mere opinion \\nor belief. McConnell, Origins, at 1489. Leading \\ndictionaries of that era defined \\u201cexercise\\u201d to include \\n\\u201c[l]abour of the body,\\u201d \\u201c[t]ask; that which one is \\nappointed to perform,\\u201d \\u201c[a]ct of divine worship, \\nwhether public or private,\\u201d or \\u201c[t]o use or practice.\\u201d See id.  (collecting dictionary definitions). Conscience, \\n 14\\non the other hand, was more likely to imply a \\n\\u201cnatural knowledge, or the faculty that decides on \\nthe right or wrong of actions.\\u201d Id. (quoting N. \\nWebster, A Dictionary of The English Language 301 (New Haven 1807)). \\nParticularly instructive on this distinction is the \\nGeorgia Charter of 1732. The Charter included \\u201ca \\nliberty of conscience allowe d in the worship of God, \\nto all persons,\\u201d but reserved the more exclusive right to \\u201ca free exercise of religion,\\u201d only to \\u201call such persons, except papists.\\u201d Id., at 1489\\u201390. By granting \\nCatholics only a liberty of conscience, but not the free exercise of religion, the Georgia Charter necessarily \\nreserved a fuller right to non-Catholic worshipers. \\nOne scholar has observed that \\u201c[t]he most plausible \\nreading of the provision is that it permitted Catholics \\nto believe what they wished . . . but did not permit \\nthem to put their faith into action.\\u201d Id., at 1490. \\nBy including a full and robust \\u201cfree exercise of \\nreligion\\u201d within the First Amendment, the Founders understood that they were protecting not only the \\nright for the religious to believe what their faith \\ntaught, but to put those beliefs into action. To \\nconclude otherwise would be to \\u201ctrivialize the idea of \\nreligion by separating thought from life, faith from \\nworks.\\u201d Report to the Attorney General, supra note \\n2, at 31. Possessing \\u201ca right to believe something in one\\u2019s mind without the freedom to utter it, advocate it, or even translate it into life,\\u201d is hardly a \\nsubstantive freedom at all. Id., at 31\\u201332. \\n2. Consistent with the Founders\\u2019 understanding \\nof a robust religious liberty protection that included \\nthe right to act out your faith was the axiom that \\n 15\\naction naturally includes expression or the freedom \\nto refrain from expression that conflicts with belief. \\nAlthough early religious liberty controversies were \\nrelatively limited, the historical record includes \\nexamples of protections for religious exercise \\nintertwined with such expressive activity. \\nAn early source of common conflict, for example, \\narose around the issue of oath requirements. Oaths \\nserved as \\u201cthe principal means of ensuring honest \\ntestimony and solemnizing obligations.\\u201d McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1467. But many early religious sects \\nrefused to take an oath, believing it was in conflict \\nwith the teachings of the New Testament.3 Id. \\nBecause oaths were required before court testimony, this refusal often left these sincere religious objectors \\nwithout access to the court system. Id. \\nIn response, many of the early colonies adopted \\nalternatives, allowing relig ious dissenters to take a \\npledge or make an affirmation rather than to swear \\nan oath. Id., at 1467\\u201368 (\\u201cBy 1789, virtually all of the \\nstates had enacted oath exemptions.\\u201d). This simple solution permitted religious sects access to the court \\nsystem, without requiring them to act out of step \\n                                           \\n3 See Matthew 5:33-37 (\\u201cAgain, ye have heard that it hath \\nbeen said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, \\nbut shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: But I say unto you, \\nSwear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: Nor \\nby the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is \\nthe city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy \\nhead, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever \\nis more than these cometh of evil.\\u201d). \\n 16\\nwith their religious beliefs or to make an expression \\nthey found incompatible with their faith. \\nA still more extreme example of laws yielding to \\nexpressive activities of religious sects in the \\nFounding Generation can be found in colonial \\nGeorgia. There, the Trus tees of Georgia granted \\ncertain groups of religious refugees a general exemption from the laws that allowed them \\u201cto organize themselves in accordance with their own \\nfaith.\\u201d Id., at 1471. One historia n described one such \\ngroup from Salzburg\\u2014which formed the town of Ebenezer\\u2014as \\u201ca state within a state, a sort of \\ntheocracy under the direction of their minsters with \\ndaily conferences of the entire congregation in which \\nGod\\u2019s guidance was invoked at the beginning and the \\nend.\\u201d Id. Although these groups where required to \\nobey certain colonial laws pertaining to military service, property, and good governance, they were \\n\\u201cotherwise free to govern themselves.\\u201d Id. at 1471 \\nn.312 \\nAnother founding era example of religious \\nexemptions for expressive action appeared in North \\nCarolina and Maryland. There, laws exempted \\nmembers of certain religious sects from a \\nrequirement to remove their hat in court. Id. The \\nreligious objectors viewed such an action as \\u201ca form of obeisance to secular authority forbidden by their \\nreligion.\\u201d Id., at 1472. Rather than forcing members \\nof these sects to choose be tween access to the courts \\nor expressing themselves in violation of their religious beliefs, states offered an exemption. \\nWhile this example may seem trivial by today\\u2019s \\nstandards, it was very mu ch on the minds of the \\n 17\\nFounding Generation. At the time, \\u201c[o]ne of the most \\nnotorious courtroom cases of religious intolerance in \\nEngland involved William Penn\\u2019s refusal to remove \\nhis hat when he appeared in court\\u201d to face \\nindictment for speaking to  an unlawful assembly. Id. \\nWhen Penn refused to remove a court-furnished hat from his head in respect to the court, he was held in \\ncontempt and imprisoned. Id. This case attracted \\nsignificant attention in America, and undoubtedly influenced the exemptions passed in North Carolina and Maryland. Id. \\nIndeed, the importance of this exemption was \\ndemonstrated in debates over the Bill of Rights in \\nthe First Congress. Id., at 1472, n.320. In ridiculing \\nthe list of freedoms proposed to be protected, Theodore Sedgwick of Mass achusetts remarked \\u201cthey \\nmight have declared that a man should have a right to wear his hat if he pleased . . . but he would ask the \\ngentleman whether he thought it necessary to enter \\nthese trifles in a declaration of rights.\\u201d Id. (citation \\nomitted). With unmistakable reference to the Penn case, John Page of Virginia replied: \\nThe gentleman from \\nMassachusetts . . . objects to the clause, \\nbecause the right is of so trivial a \\nnature. He supposes it no more \\nessential than whether a man has a \\nright to wear his hat or not; but let me \\nobserve to him that such rights have \\nbeen opposed, and a man has been obliged to pull off his hat when he \\nappeared before the face of authority; \\npeople have also been prevented from \\n 18\\nassembling together on their lawful \\noccasions.  \\nId. (citation omitted). Certainly, the Founders were \\nacutely aware of the potential for abuse by \\nauthorities absent a robust religious liberty \\nprotection that clearly extended to actions, including \\nreligiously motivated expression or non-expression. \\n3. Taken together, the Free Exercise Clause and \\nthe Free Speech Clause elevate the freedom not to \\nspeak out of accordance with firmly held religious beliefs to the highest echelon of First Amendment \\nprotection. This conclusion is buttressed by the First \\nAmendment\\u2019s other guarantees\\u2014e.g., freedom of \\nassembly and freedom to petition the government. If \\nthe Free Exercise Clause conferred nothing more \\nthan a \\u201cright to express religious beliefs,\\u201d it would \\n\\u201cadd nothing to the First Amendment, since that right is fully protected by the right to assemble, \\nspeak, and publish.\\u201d Report to the Attorney General, \\nsupra note 2, at 19. Indeed, \\u201cbecause religious \\nexpression is doubly protected by the constitutional \\ntext\\u201d it would make little sense if it were \\u201cless \\nprotected in practice.\\u201d Id. , at 19, n.30. \\nThe examples cited above represent a clear \\nunderstanding by the Founding Generation that civil \\nlaws, even of general applicability, must yield when they conflict with religious expression or the freedom \\nto refrain from expression on the basis of a sincerely \\nheld religious belief. As it seems early legislative \\nbodies believed exemptions in such cases were \\nrequired by the principle of free exercise, it stands to \\nreason that the Framers understood \\u201csimilar \\napplications of the principle\\u201d would guide the courts \\n 19\\nin these cases, once \\u201centrusted with the \\nresponsibility of enforcing\\u201d First Amendment \\nguarantees. McConnell, Origins, at 1473. \\nAlthough there was a dearth of litigation over \\nreligious liberty protections in the early years of the \\nRepublic, what scarce examples exist support this \\nview. Consider, for example, the earliest state court \\nopinion addressing the issue of a religious liberty exemption, People v. Phillips . In that case, the court \\nheld that the New York Constitution protected a Catholic priest from compulsory testimony to \\nmatters learned while administering the Sacrament \\nof Confession. See  id., at 1504. \\nImportant to the Phillips court was the notion \\nthat requiring testimony from the priest to \\u201cwhat he \\nreceives in confession, is to declare that there shall \\nbe no penance; and this important branch of the Roman Catholic religion would be thus annihilated.\\u201d \\nId. (citation omitted). The court did not believe it was \\ncompatible with religious liberty to compel expression that would so eviscerate a core belief of Catholic faith. Rather than establishing a special \\nprivilege for adherents to the Catholic faith, though, \\nthe court viewed its actions as necessary to ensure \\nCatholics received the same  treatment as Protestants \\n(the dominant faith at the time) in the administration of their sacraments. Id., at 1504-05. \\nThe through line to the Founding Generation\\u2019s \\nunderstanding of religious liberty was a belief that \\nsuch freedom was without substantive meaning if it did not encompass expression, and non-expression, \\nrooted in religious belief. Noted Nineteenth Century \\n 20\\nConstitutional commentator, Michigan Supreme \\nCourt Justice Thomas Cooley, explained: \\nAn earnest believer usually regards it as his duty to propagate his opinions, \\nand to bring others to his views. To \\ndeprive him of this right is to take from \\nhim the power to perform what he \\nconsiders a most sacred obligation.  \\nT. Cooley, A Treatise on the Constitutional \\nLimitations 665 (7th ed. 1903). Put another way: \\nreligious freedom, as understood by the Founders, \\nnecessarily encompasses the freedom to put belief \\ninto action, to engage in expression consistent with \\nthe dogmas of your faith, and to refrain from \\nexpression that may engender extratemporal consequences. \\nII. T\\nHIS COURT \\u2019S PRECEDENTS \\u2014ESPECIALLY ITS \\nDEMANDING APPLICATION OF THE LEAST -\\nRESTRICTIVE MEANS TEST \\u2014DEMONSTRATE \\nAGREEMENT WITH THE FOUNDING GENERATION \\u2019S \\nROBUST RELIGIOUS LIBERTY PROTECTIONS . \\nThis Court has a commendable history of \\nrecognizing the principles discussed above. In \\nparticular, the Court\\u2019s recent religious liberty \\njurisprudence has been a welcome reprieve for \\nmembers of all faith communities who have been disheartened by the antagonism of some government \\nactors. See,  e.g., Espinoza v. Mont. Dept of Revenue , \\n140 S. Ct. 2246 (2020); Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. \\nColo. Civil Rights Comm\\u2019n , 138 S. Ct. 1719 (2018); \\nHosanna-Tabor , 565 U.S. 171. \\n 21\\nOf particular note is the Court\\u2019s insistence on a \\nforceful application of the strict scrutiny test to any \\nrestriction that burdens religious liberty. Indeed, \\u201cin \\nthis highly sensitive constitutional area, \\u2018only the \\ngravest abuses, endangering paramount interests, \\ngive occasion for permissible limitation.\\u2019\\u201d Sherbert v. \\nVerner , 374 U.S. 398, 406 (1963) (quoting Thomas v. \\nCollins, 323 U.S. 516, 530 (1945)). \\n1. A few examples illustrate the point. Consider \\nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. , where this \\nCourt considered a government-imposed contraceptive mandate on private employers who \\nbelieved such a requirement to be against their \\nreligious beliefs. 573 U.S. 682, 726 (2014).\\n4 While \\nassuming, without deciding, that the government\\u2019s \\ninterest was compelling, the Court nonetheless found \\nthat the least-restrictive-means standard was not \\nmet. Id., at 728. Identifying alternative solutions to \\nthe rigid mandate imposed by the government, the Court explained, \\u201c[t]he least-restrictive-means \\nstandard is exceptionally demanding.\\u201d Id.  As Justice \\nKennedy explained, religious freedom \\u201cimplicates more than just freedom of belief\\u201d; rather \\u201c[i]t means, too, the right to express those beliefs and to establish \\none\\u2019s religious (or nonreligious) self-definition in the \\npolitical, civic, and econ omic life of our larger \\n                                           \\n4 Hobby Lobby  was decided under the Religious Freedom \\nRestoration Act of 1993 (\\u201cRFRA\\u201d), which requires as an initial \\nmatter finding a substantial government burden on the exercise of religion; if such a burden exists, the Court must determine \\nwhether there is a compelling governmental interest and that \\nthe burden is the least restrictive means of furthering that \\ninterest. Hobby Lobby , 573 U.S., at 694-95. \\n 22\\ncommunity.\\u201d Id., at 736\\u201337 (Kennedy, J., \\nconcurring). \\nIn another instance, this Court found Missouri \\nviolated a church\\u2019s religious  liberty guarantees under \\nthe First Amendment when it categorically denied \\ntheir participation in a grant program for playground \\nsurface materials. Trinity Lutheran Church of \\nColumbia, Inc. v. Comer , 137 S. Ct. 2012, 2017, 2025 \\n(2017). Finding that otherwise eligible grant \\nrecipients were disqualified solely because of their \\nreligious nature, this Court held that such a penalty \\nworked against the free exercise of religion and \\u201ctriggers the most exacting scrutiny.\\u201d Id., at 2021. \\nImportantly, the harm was not the denial of the grant itself but instead was Missouri\\u2019s refusal to \\neven allow the church to compete with secular \\norganizations for grant funds solely on the basis of \\nits religious identity. Id., at 2022. \\nMore recently still, this Court took up the mantle \\nof religious liberties in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia . \\nDespite the Catholic Church\\u2019s over two centuries of dedication to serving the needy children of \\nPhiladelphia, the City in 2018 stopped referring foster children to the Catholic Social Services (\\u201cCSS\\u201d) \\nafter learning the organization would not \\u201cconsider \\nprospective foster parents in same-sex marriages.\\u201d \\nFulton , 141 S. Ct., at 1874\\u201375. Finding that \\u201cit is \\nplain\\u201d the City burdens CSS\\u2019s \\u201creligious exercise by putting it to the choice of  curtailing its mission or \\napproving relationships inconsistent with its beliefs,\\u201d this Court sought a review of whether such burden \\nwas \\u201cconstitutionally permissible.\\u201d Id., at 1876. In \\ndetermining that Philadelphia imposed an unconstitutional burden on CSS\\u2019s religious exercise, \\n 23\\nFulton  admonishes that \\u201cso lo ng as the government \\ncan achieve its interests in a manner that does not \\nburden religion, it must do so.\\u201d Id., at 1881. \\nTaken together, the precedents of this Court \\nestablish that an exacting analysis is required in \\nreligious liberty cases to determine whether the \\ngovernment\\u2019s interest is compelling, and its burden \\nnarrowly tailored to achieve that interest. The \\nexistence of an alternative means for achieving even \\na compelling interest is nearly always fatal to the government\\u2019s argument.  \\n2. When religious liberty and free expression \\nconcerns intertwine, this Court has been even less \\nhesitant to invalidate an infringing law. This \\nskepticism is warranted, as attempts to compel \\nexpression that conflicts with an individual\\u2019s \\nreligious beliefs are nothing more than indirect \\nattempts to regulate religion itself. \\nIn 1943, this Court took issue with a West \\nVirginia law mandating a flag salute and pledge, when its application was challenged by a group of \\nJehovah\\u2019s Witnesses who said such action violated \\ntheir religious beliefs. W. Va. State Bd. Of Educ. V. \\nBarnette , 319 U.S. 624 (1943). Refusing to find that \\n\\u201ca Bill of Rights which guards the individual\\u2019s right \\nto speak his own mind, left it open to public \\nauthorities to compel him to utter what is not on his \\nmind,\\u201d the Barnette  Court blocked the law\\u2019s \\nenforcement. Id. , at 634; see also  id., at 645 (Murphy, \\nJ., concurring) (recognizing \\u201c[t]he right of freedom of thought and of religion as guaranteed by the \\nConstitution against State action includes both the \\nright to speak freely and the right to refrain from \\n 24\\nspeaking at all\\u201d). Underlying the Court\\u2019s opinion was \\nthe belief that \\u201c[i]f there is any fixed star in our \\nconstitutional constellation, it is that no official, high \\nor petty, can prescribe what  shall be orthodox in \\npolitics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act \\ntheir faith therein.\\u201d Id., at 642. \\nExpanding on the holding in Barnette , the Court \\nin Wooley v. Maynard  considered a religious \\nobjection to display of the New Hampshire state motto\\u2014\\u201cLive Free or Die\\u201d\\u2014on the license plate of a \\ncar owned by Jehovah\\u2019s Witness. 430 U.S. 705 (1977). In Wooley , the Court expressly rejected the \\nidea that \\u201cthe State may constitutionally require an individual to participate in the dissemination of an \\nideological message by displaying it on his private \\nproperty.\\u201d Id., at 713. \\nFoundational to its decision was the Court\\u2019s \\nholding that the freedoms contained within the First \\nAmendment \\u201cincludes both the right to speak freely \\nand the right to refrain from speaking at all.\\u201d Id., at \\n714. It matters not whether most agree with the message the State seeks to force a person to convey; the First Amendment unquestionably \\u201cprotects the \\nright of individuals to hold a point of view different \\nfrom the majority and to refu se to foster . . . an idea \\nthey find morally objectionable.\\u201d Id. , at 715. Finding \\nthe existence of a governmental burden, the Court \\nwas left to question whether a substantial \\ngovernmental interest existed and, if so, whether the \\nburden was narrowly tailored to advance that \\ninterest. Even assuming a legitimate and substantial interest, the Court concluded \\u201cthat purpose cannot \\nbe pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental \\n 25\\npersonal liberties when the end can be more \\nnarrowly achieved.\\u201d Id., at 716. New Hampshire \\nfailed that test. \\nIn still another line of cases, this Court found \\nthat it violated Constitutional protections to subject religious observants, who went door to door \\ndistributing religious materials and soliciting for the \\npurchase of religious books, to a government \\nsolicitation registration requirement. Murdock v. \\nPennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105 (1943); see also Follett v. \\nTown of McCormick , 321 U.S. 573 (1944). \\nAcknowledging that the practice was derived from the believer\\u2019s understanding that he was \\u201cobeying a \\ncommandment of God,\\u201d the Court found that the First Amendment prohibited the imposition of a \\ngenerally applicable registration requirement to \\nengage in such conduct. Murdock , 319 U.S., at 108, \\n117. Indeed, the Court went out of its way to describe the literature being distributed as \\u201cprovocative, \\nabusive, and ill-mannered.\\u201d Id., at 115\\u201316. \\nNevertheless, \\u201c[p]lainly  a community may not \\nsuppress . . . the dissemination of views because they \\nare unpopular, annoying or distasteful.\\u201d Id.,  at 116 \\nTo allow otherwise would \\u201cbe a complete repudiation of the philosophy of the Bill of Rights.\\u201d Id. \\nThe Court went further still , establishing that the \\nmere fact the religious materials were being \\u201csold\\u201d was not enough to transform \\u201cevangelism into a \\ncommercial enterprise.\\u201d Id., at 111. As such, the \\nCourt acknowledged heightened constitutional protections for \\u201cthose spreading their religious \\nbeliefs through the spoken and printed word.\\u201d Id. As \\ncompared to purely commercial activity, \\u201c[f]reedom of \\n 26\\npress, freedom of speech, fr eedom of religion are in a \\npreferred position.\\u201d Id., at 115. \\nEven Employment Division v. Smith , often \\ncriticized as having watered down constitutional \\nreligious liberty protections, recognized the Court\\u2019s \\nunique hostility toward burdens that implicate both \\nthe free exercise of religion and the freedom of \\nspeech. The \\u201cFirst Amendment bars application of a \\nneutral, generally applicable law to religiously \\nmotivated action\\u201d when that action \\u201cinvolve[s] not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but the Free \\nExercise Clause in conjunction with other \\nconstitutional protections, such as freedom of \\nspeech.\\u201d Empl. Div. v. Smith , 494 U.S. 872, 881\\u201382 \\n(1990). Even some preceden ts, decided on free speech \\ngrounds alone, were undoubtedly reinforced by \\ntouches of freedom-of-religion concerns. Id. \\n3. This much is clear: the arc of this Court\\u2019s \\nprecedent bends in one incontrovertible direction. \\nScrutiny of any government burden is at its zenith \\nwhen the burden effects an individual\\u2019s exercise of their religious beliefs in a manner that implicates \\nfree speech protections. This conclusion, rooted in the \\nhistory and tradition of religious exercise as \\nunderstood by the Founders and enshrined in the \\nFirst Amendment, demands that any such burden be \\nsubjected to the most rigorous application of strict \\nscrutiny analysis. \\nIt is precisely for this reason that, to the best of \\nAmicus Curiae\\u2019s knowledge, the Court has never \\nissued an opinion finding that governmentally \\ncompelled religious speech satisfies strict scrutiny. \\nSee 303 Creative Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Elenis , 6 F.4th \\n 27\\n1160, 1191 (U.S. 10th Cir. 2021) (Tymkovich, C.J., \\ndissenting) (\\u201c[T]he majority takes the remarkable\\u2014\\nand novel\\u2014stance that the government may force \\nMs. Smith to produce messages that violate her \\nconscience. . . . No case has ever gone so far.\\u201d). \\nThis case should not be the first. \\nIII. THE TENTH CIRCUIT \\u2019S OPINION CANNOT BE \\nSQUARED EITHER WITH THE FIRST \\nAMENDMENT \\u2019S RICH HISTORY OR THIS COURT \\u2019S \\nPROTECTION OF BELIEVERS \\u2019 FREE SPEECH \\nRIGHTS . \\nIn its permissive application of strict scrutiny, the \\nTenth Circuit bastardized this Court\\u2019s protection of free speech rights, especially as applied to religious \\nexpression. If allowed to stand, its precedent will give license to courts across this Country to \\nhumiliate members of all religious sects by \\ncompelling them to speak in contravention of their \\nsincerely held religious beliefs. By purporting to \\napply strict scrutiny, the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s opinion \\ncheapened the First Amendment rights of Catholics, \\nProtestants, Muslims, Jews, and all other believers alike. \\nLuckily, this precedent d oes not need to stand. \\nThis Court, once again, has an opportunity to \\nadmonish that the free speech protections of \\nbelievers are no less than non-believers and, in fact, \\nare heightened when faced with government \\nregulation that would compel speech antithetical to the tenants of a believer\\u2019s faith. The First \\nAmendment commands such a result. \\n 28\\nAlthough the Tenth Circuit rightly concluded that \\nMs. Smith\\u2019s website designs are \\u201cpure speech,\\u201d 303 \\nCreative LLC, 6 F.4th, at 1176, the Tenth Circuit \\nwrongly concludes that the commercial nature of Ms. \\nSmith\\u2019s speech gives Colorado a regulatory hook to \\nlatch onto. Id., at 1179. By failing to acknowledge the \\nreligious nature of her objection to the would-be compelled speech, the Tenth Circuit did not afford \\nher First Amendment rights the \\u201cpreferred\\u201d status \\nthey deserve.\\n5 Cf., Murdock , 319 U.S., at 115. What \\nis remarkable is that the religious nature of Ms. Smith\\u2019s objection is not disputed. See 303 \\nCreative, 6 F. 4th, at 1172 (Ms. Smith is \\u201cwilling to create custom graphics and websites for gay, lesbian, \\nor bisexual clients . . . so long as the custom graphics \\nand websites do not violate [her] religious beliefs, as is true for all customers.\\u201d (internal quotation marks \\nomitted)); id., at 1192 (Tymkovich, C.J., dissenting) \\n(\\u201cIn short, Colorado appear s to agree that Ms. Smith \\ndoes not distinguish between customers based on \\nprotected-class status and thus advances the aims of \\nCADA. But when any customer asks Ms. Smith to \\ncreate expressive content that violates her sincerely \\nheld beliefs, she will decline the request.\\u201d). \\n                                           \\n5 Remarkably, the Tenth Circuit  suggests that its sweeping \\nholding may not apply to \\u201call artists\\u201d if they were not engaged \\nin \\u201ccommercial activity,\\u201d but rather \\u201ccommissioning a mural for some charitable purpose.\\u201d 303 Creative , 6 F.4th, at 1182, n.6. To \\nsuggest that a local artist wh o refuses to paint a Christian \\nmural for a church may enjoy more constitutional protections \\nthan a woman called to live out her sincerely held religious \\nbeliefs by creating custom wedding websites is, thankfully, not supported by the history or tradition of the First Amendment \\nand the muscular protections it affords religious believers. \\n 29\\nThis failure is compounded by the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s \\nfallacy of a marketplace of one for Ms. Smith\\u2019s \\nspeech. Id. at 1180. Such convenient analysis \\nallowed the court to conclude \\u201cthere are no less intrusive means of providing equal access to those  \\ntypes of services.\\u201d Id. (emphasis added). But this \\nclever reasoning flips this Court\\u2019s precedent on its \\nhead. Rather than prioritize the religious speaker\\u2019s \\nobjection in search of a less restrictive means, the \\ncourt below merely concluded that she is the only one and therefore no other means will suffice. But, \\nwhere, as here, the government can achieve its interests without burdening religion, the \\nConstitution requires it to do so. Fulton , 141 S. Ct., \\nat 1881. The analysis is also anomalous in the free speech context because it cannot be that the more \\nunique and distinctive the speech, the less  First \\nAmendment protection it deserves. But that is the staggering breadth of the Tenth Circuit majority\\u2019s \\nconclusion. See 303 Creative , 6 F.4th, at 1204-05 \\n(Tymkovich, C.J., dissenting).  \\nMoreover, by categorizing Ms. Smith as nothing \\nmore than a \\u201cpublic accommodation,\\u201d the Tenth \\nCircuit minimized her right to participate in the \\nmarketplace, even as a woman of faith. See 303 \\nCreative, 6 F.4th, at 1181 (\\u201c[W]hether an exception limits market access depends upon the uniqueness of \\nthe public accommodation\\u2019s goods and services\\u2014not \\nthe sincerity of the public accommodation\\u2019s beliefs.\\u201d). \\nTo deny a benefit to those \\u201cwho engage in certain \\nforms of speech is in effect to penalize them for such \\nspeech,\\u201d and constitutionally, no different than \\nconditioning a benefit on a person\\u2019s \\u201cwillingness to \\nviolate a cardinal principle of her religious faith;\\u201d the \\n 30\\nresult is the same: to \\u201cdeter[] or discourage[] the \\nexercise of First Amendment rights of expression.\\u201d \\nSherbert , 374 U.S., at 405-06 (citing Speiser v. \\nRandall, 357 U.S. 513, 518 (1958)). Here too, Colorado seeks to impose the same constitutional \\nharm: speak in violation of your core religious faith \\nor lose the benefit of marketplace participation. Put \\nsimply, Colorado seeks to punish Ms. Smith for her \\nsincerely held religious beliefs. See also Trinity \\nLutheran Church , 137 S. Ct., at 2021\\u201322 (finding a \\nconstitutional violation where a burden puts \\nreligious believers \\u201cto a choice: [] participate in an \\notherwise available benefit\\u201d or maintain your \\nreligious identity). \\nThe same fundamental principle must apply to \\nfree speech and religious practices when they act in concert: \\u201cIn an open, pluralistic, self-governing \\nsociety, the expression of an idea cannot be \\nsuppressed simply because some find it offensive, \\ninsulting, or even wounding.\\u201d Fulton , 141 S. Ct., at \\n1924-25 (Alito, J., concurring). To lose this principle is to lose the \\u201cpreservation of religious freedom.\\u201d Id., \\nat 1925. That is because \\u201c[s]uppressing speech\\u2014or \\nreligious practice\\u2014simply because it expresses an idea that some find hurtful is a zero-sum game.\\u201d Id. \\nThis Court\\u2019s jurisprudence confirms this link \\nbetween religious exercise and free speech because \\nthis Court\\u2019s opinions \\u201cmake it perfectly clear that \\ndiscrimination against religious, as opposed to \\nsecular, expression is viewpoint discrimination.\\u201d \\nNurre v. Whitehead , 559 U.S. 1025, 1028 (2010) \\n(Alito, J., dissenting). And because viewpoint discrimination is \\u201can egregious form of content \\ndiscrimination,\\u201d Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of \\n 31\\nthe Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995), it brings \\nwith it heightened constitutional skepticism. \\nAlthough some may find Ms. Smith\\u2019s religious \\nbeliefs objectionable, \\u201creligions, and those who \\nadhere to religious doctrines, may continue to \\nadvocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by \\ndivine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be \\ncondoned.\\u201d Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U.S. 644, 679 \\n(2015). \\u201cAn open society can keep that promise while still respecting the \\u2018dignity,\\u2019 \\u2018worth,\\u2019 and fundamental equality of all members of the \\ncommunity.\\u201d Fulton , 141 S. Ct., at 1925 (Alito, J., \\nconcurring) (quoting Masterpiece Cakeshop , 138 S. \\nCt., at 1727). Ms. Smith should be free to practice all \\naspects of her faith, without fear of government-\\ncompelled expression against her sincerely held \\nreligious beliefs. The Constitution demands no less. \\nCONCLUSION \\n \\n\\u201c[T]here is before us the right of freedom to \\nbelieve, freedom to worship one\\u2019s Maker according to the dictates of one\\u2019s conscience, a right which the \\nConstitution specifically shelters.\\u201d Barnette , 319 \\nU.S., at 645 (Murphy, J., concurring). For this Court, there is \\u201cno loftier duty or responsibility than to \\nuphold that spiritual freedom to its farthest \\nreaches.\\u201d Id. \\nTo exclude Ms. Smith from offering her services\\u2014\\nsolely on the basis of her religious identity\\u2014would be \\n\\u201codious to our Constitution.\\u201d Trinity Lutheran \\nChurch , 137 S. Ct., at 2025. \\n 32\\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should \\nreverse the opinion of the Tenth Circuit.  \\nJune 2, 2022   Respectfully submitted,  \\n \\nJonathan P.

As part of that project, EPA has obtained emails and handwritten and typewritten notes under public records requests, which records on their face confess to the driving factor behind this liti-gation and similar litigation and inform the inquiry into federal versus state jurisdiction in this booming class of \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation filed in state courts. These records EPA obtained prompted it to file its first amicus  brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for \\nthe First Circuit, where removal of another among the growing number of \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d lawsuits filed \\nby governmental entities seeking billions of dollars \\nfrom private parties is pending.\\n2 That brief revealed \\ntwo sets of notes each purporting, independently, to record the assertion by an official with the governmen-tal plaintiff in that case, the State of Rhode Island, that the litigation seeks to obtain a \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d to underwrite that State\\u2019s spending ambitions, \\n \\n 1 Pursuant to Rule 37.6, counsel for Amicus  certifies that no \\ncounsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in part and that no person or entity other than Amici  or their counsel made a \\nmonetary contribution intended to fund the brief \\u2019s preparation or submission. All parties\\u2019 counsel of record received notice regarding \\nthe filing of this brief on April 27,  2020. This brief is filed by con-\\nsent of all parties. Petitioners fil ed a blanket consent for all such \\nbriefs on April 13, 2020. Respondent provided its written consent via email on April 29, 2020. \\n \\n2 See State of Rhode Island v. Shell Oil Products Co., LLC, et \\nal., Case No. 19-1818 (1st Cir.). Leave for EPA to file as amicus \\ncuriae  granted on March 26, 2020 \\n2 \\n after the State\\u2019s legislature declined to provide the de-\\nsired funds. Rhode Island\\u2019s confession was made at a meeting attended by \\u201ccabinet\\u201d-level representatives of numerous state governments from across the nation, including a representative from Maryland, and empha-sized the desire to pr oceed in state courts.\\n3 In that First \\nCircuit litigation, numerous  parties rely upon the \\nFourth Circuit\\u2019s decision in  the instant matter, and par-\\nties to the First Circuit litigation ad dressed the Fourth \\nCircuit\\u2019s opinion below in let ters of supplemental au-\\nthority pursuant to Fed. R. Ap p. Pro. 28(j). Because EPA \\nhas obtained records confe ssing the rationale behind \\nthe veritable tsunami of state-court \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d lawsuits such as the one now before this Court, and af-firming the plaintiffs\\u2019 emp hasis among peers and other \\npotential governmental plaint iff-recruits on using state \\ncourts for these actions with  national p olicy implica-\\ntions and avoiding the federal court system, EPA is keenly interested in this case and asks this Court to \\ngrant certiorari to address th e proper relationship be-\\ntween the state and federal court systems. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\n As important as climate policy is to both state and \\nfederal governments, equally and arguably more im-portant is the principle that the courts\\u2019 role is not to \\nmake policy judgments. This Court held in American \\nElectric Power v. Connecticut , 131 S. Ct. 2527, 2539, \\n \\n 3 A full list of attendees prepared by the organizers and ob-\\ntained under Colorado law is ava ilable at https://govoversight.org/ \\nwp-content/uploads/2020/01/Fulsome-list-of-participants.png. \\n3 \\n 564 U.S. 410, 426 (2011) that \\u201cthe federal courts would \\nhave no warrant to employ the federal common law of nuisance to upset\\u201d federal primacy in climate regula-tory policy. But rather than heed the American Electric \\nPower  opinion\\u2019s warnings that federal policy decisions \\nare to be made by Congress or by federal agencies ex-ercising properly delegated authority, certain litigants have instead attempted to end run that holding by seeking to create policy in state, rather than federal, courts. While federal courts ar e courts of limited juris-\\ndiction, in this matter the de cision below is based upon \\na series of cases that have eviscerated the jurisdiction of federal courts, even when important federal inter-ests are at stake. This is in conflict with the decisions of other Circuits, congressional action taken since these \\nFourth Circuit precedents were  adopted, and this Court\\u2019s \\nown rulings. Allowing the opin ion below to stand will \\ncause mischief in state courts across the nation. Re-cently obtained public records provide strong impetus to acknowledge, as a formal matter, that this \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation campaign is an impermissible use of the state courts, just as this Court previously held it \\nwas an impermissible use of the federal courts. This Court should prevent litigants from seeking the most favorable forum to obtain p olitical and policy ends by \\njudicial means. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\n  \\n4 \\n ARGUMENT \\nI. THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\\u2019S DECISION CON-\\nTRADICTS RECENT JURISPRUDENCE \\nAND LEGISLATION. THIS COURT SHOULD \\nGRANT CERTIORARI TO ENFORCE ITS OWN PRECEDENTS AND CONGRESSIONAL INTENT \\n The decision below, designated for publication and \\nwith the potential to shape or confuse the law for years \\nto come, is based on a series of precedents unique to the Fourth Circuit, many of which contradict more re-\\ncent holdings of this Court and even statutory changes \\nenacted by Congress. The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s reliance on its own, idiosyncratic precedents led to a result that is \\nin conflict with the holdings  of numerous other courts \\nand which will, if allowed to stand, result in mischief across the nation. \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision below, while pub-\\nlished only this year, has its foundations in a holding \\nfrom the 1970s that has been  adrift in changing legal \\nseas since then, and was implicitly swamped by a hold-ing of this Court twenty years ago. That Fourth Circuit \\nopinion, Noel v. McCain , 538 F.2d 633 (4th Cir. 1976), \\nheld that remand orders are essentially unreviewable unless they raise very narrow statutory grounds. Stare \\ndecisis  is an important legal principle, but in this case \\nthe Fourth Circuit\\u2019s adherence to its own precedents rather than those of this Court was misplaced. \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision below acknowledges \\nthat this Court subsequently interpreted the same \\n5 \\n statutory language differently in Yamaha Motor Corp., \\nU.S.A. v. Calhoun , 516 U.S. 199 (1996). More recently, \\nthe Seventh Circuit reached a contrary conclusion \\nabout the reviewability of di strict court orders to re-\\nmand in Lu Junhong v. Boeing Co. , 792 F.3d 805, 810\\u2013\\n13 (7th Cir. 2015). Even assuming, arguendo , that the \\nFourth Circuit properly decided the Noel  case in 1976, \\ncontinued reliance on Noel  is no longer appropriate. \\n It isn\\u2019t just precedent t hat has changed since the \\nFourth Circuit issued its opinion in Noel . Relevant \\nstatutory law has also changed: the Removal Clarifica-\\ntion Act of 2011, Pub. L. No. 112-51, 125 Stat. 545, clar-ified Congressional intent for federal courts to \\u201cclarify \\nand improve certain provisions relating to the removal \\nof litigation against Federal officers or agencies to Fed-\\neral courts.\\u201d \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision below (hereinafter \\n\\u201cBaltimore \\u201d), is based on foundations that Congress, \\nother federal courts, and this Court have steadily \\neroded since the Fourth Circu it issued the authority on \\nwhich Baltimore  rests. This Court, the Seventh Circuit, \\nand Congress itself have all spoken more recently. The \\ninnovative legal theories brought by the Plaintiffs in this case further highlight the need to decide the mat-\\nter based on current law. This Court should take the \\nopportunity to apply the Removal Clarification Act and resolve the split in the circuits that the Baltimore  opin-\\nion below aggravates. \\n \\n6 \\n II. IF THE DECISION BELOW STANDS, FED-\\nERAL COURTS WILL BE UNABLE TO PRE-\\nVENT FEDERAL POLICIES FROM BEING UNDERMINED AT THE STATE LEVEL \\n This suit is but one of many similar suits being \\nfiled all over the country. More than a dozen U.S. cit-\\nies, states and counties including the State of Rhode Island, City and County of Boulder (CO), City and \\nCounty of Honolulu (HI), City of New York (NY), \\nMarin, San Mateo and Santa Cruz Counties (CA), the cities of Imperial Beach, Oakland, Richmond, San \\nFrancisco, San Mateo, and Santa Cruz (CA), and King \\nCounty (WA), among others have filed similar claims against similar and generally the same defendants al-\\nleging similar causes of action which allegedly arise \\nunder state law. As at least one court has previously noted, multi-front litigation raises important concerns \\nabout the motivations of litigants. Chevron Corp. v. \\nDonziger , 974 F.Supp.2d 362, 475 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (\\u201cThe \\npoint of the multi-front strategy thus was to leverage \\nthe expense, risks, and bu rden to [defendant] of de-\\nfending itself in multiple jurisdictions to achieve a swift recovery, most likely by precipitating a settle-\\nment.\\u201d), later upheld at Chevron Corp. v. Donziger , 833 \\nF.3d 74 (2d Cir. 2016), cert. denied  at 137 S. Ct. 2268 \\n(2017). \\n This explosion in such cases filed in state court \\nseeks many hundreds of billions of dollars from private \\nparties, and seeks to enlist the defendants as advo-\\ncates in pressing for the plai ntiffs\\u2019 and their partners\\u2019 \\ndesired federal policies. Records obtained by Amicus  \\n7 \\n also show the attempt to us e the litigation to obtain \\ngovernmental revenues after that failed through the \\nappropriate, political process (see, infra ). Affirming the \\nimpropriety of this use of the courts as well as the ar-dent campaign by state and municipal plaintiffs to \\nkeep the matters away from the federal court and ex-\\nclusively before state courts, EPA has obtained emails and handwritten and typewritten notes under public \\nrecords requests, further discussed below, that illus-\\ntrate the danger of allowing st ate courts to interfere in \\nthis way in lawful interstate commerce conducted un-\\nder the auspices of the federal government. Key among \\nthese public records are two sets of notes each purport-ing, independently, to record the assertion by a senior \\nState of Rhode Island official that the objective of its \\nlitigation was to obtain a \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d for the State\\u2019s spending ambitions, in the face of a leg-\\nislature that does not share the executive\\u2019s priorities. \\n Both sets of notes record that official as emphasiz-\\ning the use of state courts to  obtain this funding denied \\nthem by the legislature. Other records, also noted, in-\\nfra, record the plaintiff \\u2019s legal counsel\\u2019s team, at least \\nsome of whom also represent the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore in this litigation,\\n4 lobbying gov-\\nernmental officials to join the campaign emphasizing the strategy of advancing this cause in the \\u201cmore ad-vantageous venue for these cases,\\u201d which plaintiffs confess is to be had in state courts. \\n \\n 4 The California law firm Sher Edling LLP represents both \\nthe State of Rhode Island in the First Circuit and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore in the Fourth Circuit. \\n8 \\n  These public records obtained through state open \\nrecords laws by Amicus  EPA represent a Rhode Island \\n\\u201ccabinet\\u201d-level official confiding to peers that the \\nState\\u2019s elected representatives are insufficiently moved by the plaintiff \\u2019s requests to enact laws raising \\nthe revenues the State\\u2019s executive desires; and that it \\nis thus \\u201clooking for [a] sustainable funding stream,\\u201d having been reduced to \\u201csuing big oil\\u201d for its \\u201cPriority \\n\\u2013 sustainable funding stream .\\u201d Notably, both sets of \\nnotes capture the State of Rhode Island as having em-phasized the \\u201cstate court\\u201d aspect of its plan. \\n These records, representing a similarly-situated \\nplaintiff \\u2019s confession, as recorded identically by two by \\nothers in the comfort of a presumably candid and off-\\nthe-record private meeting with peers and funders of \\u201cclimate\\u201d activism, leave little doubt that this growing \\nwave of state court \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation seeks \\nat least two impermissible objectives. First, this type of litigation seeks to use (state) courts to effectively \\ncreate federal energy and environmental policy. Sec-\\nond, in addition to using litigation as a stand-in for \\nthe political process that has denied state and munic-\\nipal plaintiffs their desired policies, it seeks to use lit-\\nigation to raise revenues having be en denied them \\nwhere revenues would properly be raised, which \\nagain is by the po litical process. \\n These public records provide strong impetus to \\nacknowledge, as a formal matter, that this \\u201cclimate \\nnuisance\\u201d litigation campaign is an impermissible use of the courts, seeking the most favorable forum to ob-\\ntain political ends by judicial means; that when filed \\n9 \\n they must remain in federal court; and that they \\nshould be dismissed for the same reasons. \\n \\nIII. PUBLIC RECORDS OBTAINED BY PRO-\\nPOSED AMICUS CURIAE  AFFIRM THIS \\nCASE BELONGS IN FEDERAL COURT \\n Amicus  EPA has obtained public records from Col-\\norado State University\\u2019s Center for a New Energy Economy (\\u201cCNEE\\u201d) under the Colorado Open Records \\nAct (\\u201cCORA\\u201d). Those records have now been brought to \\nthe attention of the First Circuit in related litigation, and are proper subject for judic ial notice by this Court. \\nSee Fed. Rule Evid. 201(b)(2). The records pertain to a \\ntwo-day meeting in July 2019 hosted by the Rockefel-ler Brothers Fund (\\u201cRBF\\u201d) at the Rockefeller family \\nmansion at Pocantico, NY. They include numerous \\nemails, agendas and other materials. Most pertinent, they also include a set of handwritten notes and a sec-\\nond, corroborating set of typewritten notes. According \\nto the public records themselves, the former was pre-pared by attendee Carla Frisch of the Rocky Mountain \\nInstitute (\\u201cRMI\\u201d), and the latter by attendee Katie \\nMcCormack of the Energy Foundation.\\n5 \\n \\n 5 These are available, respectively, at https://climatelitigationwatch. \\norg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Carla-Frisch-handwritten-notes- EPA_CORA1505.pdf and https:// climatelitigationwatch.org/ \\nwp-content/uploads/2020/03/EF-Katie-McCormack-typed-notes-EPA_CORA1542.pdf. These documents are identified in an August \\n20, 2019 email from CNEE\\u2019s Patric k Cummins transmitting them \\nto RBF\\u2019s Michael Northrop, Subject: meeting highlights, available at https://climatelitigationwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ \\n \\n10 \\n  This was a private event, styled \\u201cAccelerating \\nState Action on Climate Change,\\u201d if hosted as a forum \\nfor policy activists and a major funder to coordinate \\nwith senior public employees, e.g., a governor\\u2019s chief of staff and department secretaries and their cabinet \\nequivalents from fifteen states. These states included \\nFirst Circuit Plaintiff the State of Rhode Island, repre-sented by its Director of the Department of Environ-\\nmental Management, Janet Coit.\\n6 \\n These notes purport to contemporaneously record \\nthe comments of Director Coit discussing Rhode Is-\\nland\\u2019s entry in this litigation campaign, among peers. One passage in each set of no tes, attributed to Director \\nCoit and replicated almost verbatim in both, is partic-\\nularly striking and relevant, affirming two points that have become obvious and which should inform key de-\\ncisions confronting the judiciary in this \\u201cclimate nui-\\nsance\\u201d litigation campaign. \\n The records show RMI\\u2019s Frisch recorded Director \\nCoit speaking to this litigation as shown in the below \\n \\nEdited-notes-transmittal-email-CSU-suggests-Snail-mail-probably- \\ncovered-EPA_CORA1481_Redacted.pdf. \\u201cRBF CNEE climate pol-icy notes Jul 17 18.docx\\u201d are Katie McCormack\\u2019s notes (Energy Foundation); these appear to be produced as document EPA_ CORA1542.pdf, derived from Ms. McCormick\\u2019s transmittal email \\nbeing 1541, in which she describes her notes as long, and 1542 consists of 18 pages of notes;  \\u201cXerox Scan_07222019155622.pdf \\u201d \\nare Carla Frisch\\u2019s handwritten notes (this was produced as docu-ment EPA_CORA1505.pdf ). \\n \\n6 The participant list is availabl e at https://climatelitigation-\\nwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/List-of-Attendees-EPA_ CORA1037.pdf. \\n11 \\n excerpted image (Ms. Frisch\\u2019s notes are available in \\nfull at https://climatelitigationwatch.org/wp-content/ \\nuploads/2020/03/Carla-Frisch-handwritten-notes-EPA_ \\nCORA1505.pdf ). Ms. Frisch recorded Director Coit as saying, about this suit: \\nRI \\u2013 Gen Assembly D but doesn\\u2019t care on env/climate \\nlooking for sustainable funding stream \\nsuing big oil for RI damages in state court \\n \\n The first line-item attributes to Director Coit the \\nposition that the Rhode Island legislature is not per-suaded of the claims set fort h by the State in its litiga-\\ntion. This reluctance to politically impose the revenue-\\nraising measures (taxes) necessary for such funding streams is inherently shared among all \\u201cclimate nui-\\nsance\\u201d plaintiffs. The excerp t appears to also reflect \\nDirector Coit\\u2019s view of why the Rhode Island legisla-ture has thereby declined to obtain from the taxpayer, \\n\\n12 \\n and then appropriate to the State, the revenue streams \\nthat governmental Plaintiff Rhode Island desires. \\n This entry on its face represents a senior official \\nconfessing that Rhode Island\\u2019s climate litigation, es-\\nsentially identical to that in the Baltimore case below, \\nis in fact a product of Rhode Island\\u2019s elected represent-atives lacking enthusiasm for politically enacting cer-\\ntain policies, including reve nue measures, thus leaving \\nthe state \\u201clooking for [a] sustainable funding stream,\\u201d and so \\u201csuing big oil.\\u201d This characterizes all such gov-\\nernmental plaintiffs and su its including the matter \\nin the Fourth Circuit case which is the subject of the \\nPetition in this matter. \\n Fortunately, we can be confident that Ms. Frisch \\ndid not mishear Director Coit. The Energy Foundation\\u2019s \\nKatie McCormack provided RBF with a typewritten \\nset of her own notes transcribing the proceedings. To this Court\\u2019s further benefit, Ms. McCormack\\u2019s type-\\nwritten transcription of Director Coit\\u2019s commentary \\nreads almost verbatim as Ms. Frisch\\u2019s. \\n Ms. McCormack recorded Di rector Coit as saying: \\n* Assembly very conservative leadership \\u2013 don\\u2019t \\ncare about env\\u2019t \\n* If care, put it in the budget \\n* Priority \\u2013 sustainable funding stream * State court against oil/gas \\n13 \\n  \\n These notes on their face both affirm two realities \\nthat have become inescapable in recent years about this epidemic of \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation, all chan-neled into state courts (aft er the first generation of \\nsuits floundered in federal co urt, and ultimately were \\nterminated by this Court in American Electric Power v. \\nConnecticut , 131 S. Ct. 2527, 2539, 564 U.S. 410, 426 \\n(2011)).\\n7 That is that these suits seek to use the courts \\nto stand in for policymakers on two fronts. First, these suits ask the courts to substitute their authority for that of the political branches of government on matters of policy. Second, these suits seek billions of dollars in revenues, again the province of the political branches, for distribution toward political uses and constituen-cies. \\n O n  t h a t  fi r s t  c o u n t  o f  policymaking through the \\ncourts, the RBF meeting notes ratify a comment made to The Nation magazine by the plaintiffs\\u2019 tort lawyer credited with inventing this wave of litigation, Matt \\n \\n 7 See, e.g., Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp ., \\n663 F.Supp.2d 863 (N.D. Cal. 2009), upheld at  696 F.3d 849 (9th \\nCir. 2012). \\n\\n14 \\n Pawa. The magazine wrote, \\u201cAt the end of his speech, \\nSenator [Sheldon] Whitehouse [of Rhode Island] re-minded his colleagues of their \\u2018legislative responsibil-ity to address climate change.\\u2019 But it\\u2019s clear that too many lawmakers have abdicated, thus the pressure to tackle the climate issue thro ugh existing regulations \\nlike the Clean Air Act, and through the courts. \\u2018I\\u2019ve been hearing for twelve years or more that legislation is right around the corner that\\u2019s going to solve the global-warming problem, and that litigation is too long, difficult, and arduous a path,\\u2019 said Matthew Pawa, a climate attorney. \\u2018Legislation is going nowhere, so liti-gation could potentially play an important role.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n8 \\n Such use of the courts is of course improper but \\nalso informs a conclusion that these cases, when \\nbrought, belong in federal cour t, as well as that they \\nshould be dismissed for reasons including the inher-\\nently obvious, and now repeatedly confessed, purpose. \\n The second conclusion affirmed by these twice-\\nsourced assertions by the First Circuit plaintiffs is that \\nthis type of litigation is a grab for revenues, which again must properly be purs ued through the political \\nprocess. This is related to the first, in that, like policy, \\nsuch revenue-raising measures must be enacted by the voters\\u2019 elected representatives or approved directly by \\nvoters. Instead, with the desire for more \\u201cfunding \\nstreams\\u201d being yet another way the political process \\n \\n 8 Zoe Carpenter, The Government May Already Have the \\nLaw It Needs to Beat Big Oil , The Nation (July 15, 2015), \\nhttps://www.thenation.com/article/the-government-may-already-have-the-law-it-needs-to-beat-big-oil/. \\n15 \\n has failed such plaintiffs, we see them circumventing \\nthat process through this litigation campaign. \\n That the desire for more governmental revenue, \\nwithout adopting the necessa ry direct taxes for which \\nthere can be a political price to pay, was behind such \\nlitigation was suggested by the U.S. Chamber of Com-merce in a 2019 report enti tled \\u201cMitigating Munici-\\npality Litigation: Scope and Solutions,\\u201d published by \\nthe Chamber\\u2019s Institute fo r Legal Reform. That re-\\nport highlighted: \\n* \\u201cFor instance, local government leaders may \\neye the prospect of significant recoveries as a \\nmeans of making up for budget shortfalls.\\u201d \\n* \\u201cLarge settlements like those produced in the \\ntobacco litigation are alluring to municipali-\\nties facing budget constraints.\\u201d \\n* \\u201cSevere, persistent municipal budget con-\\nstraints have coincided with the rise of munic-ipal litigation agains t opioid manufacturers \\nas local governments are promised large re-\\ncoveries with no risk to municipal budgets by contingency fee trial lawyers.\\u201d \\n* \\u201cConclusion  A convergence of factors is propelling munici-\\npalities to file affirmative lawsuits against corporate entities. \\n There is the \\u2018push\\u2019 factor: municipalities face \\nhistoric budgetary cons traints and a public \\ninundated with news reports on the opioid cri-\\nsis, rising sea levels, and data breaches. And \\n16 \\n there is the \\u2018pull\\u2019 of potential multimillion-\\ndollar settlements and low-cost, contingency \\nfee trial lawyers. As a consequence, munici-\\npalities are pivoting to the courts by the thou-\\nsands.\\u201d9 \\n The National Association of Manufacturers\\u2019 Cen-\\nter for Legal Action has similarly argued that, \\u201cThe \\ntowns and lawyers have said that this litigation is \\nsolely about money. The towns want funding for local projects, and their lawyers are working on a contin-\\ngency fee basis, which means they aren\\u2019t paid if they \\ndon\\u2019t win.\\u201d\\n10 \\n The records EPA has obtained now provide docu-\\nmentary evidence to support these concerns that the courts are being exploited to balance municipal/state \\nbudgets and make policy decisions that legislators \\nhave declined to make. \\n \\n  \\n \\n 9 United States Chamber of Co mmerce, \\u201cMitigating Munici-\\npality Litigation: Scope and Solutions,\\u201d U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, March 2019, h ttps://www.instituteforlegalre-\\nform.com/uploads/sites/1/Mitigating-Municipality-Litigation-2019- Research.pdf, at p. 1, 6, 7 and 18, respectively. \\n \\n10 Manufacturers\\u2019 Accountability Project, \\u201cBeyond the Court-\\nroom: Climate Liability Litigation in the United States,\\u201d p. 2, https://mfgaccountabilityproject.or g/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ \\nMAP-Beyond-the-Courtroom-Chapter-One.pdf \\n17 \\n IV. HISTORIC CONCERNS ABOUT STATE \\nCOURT BIAS ARE AMPLIFIED IN CASES \\nOF THIS TYPE, SUCH THAT FEDERAL \\nCOURTS SHOULD STEP IN TO PROTECT \\nFEDERAL INTERESTS \\n A \\u201chistoric concern about state court bias\\u201d is the \\nunderlying basis allowing for federal officer removal. \\nSavoie v. Huntington Ingalls, Inc. , 817 F.3d 457, 461 \\n(5th Cir. 2016). The Supreme Court also recognizes bias as a concern justifying removal to federal court. \\n\\u201cState-court proceedings may reflect \\u2018local prejudice\\u2019 \\nagainst unpopular federal laws or federal officials.\\u201d Watson v. Philip Morris Cos. , 551 U.S. 142, 150 (2007). \\nBias exists, as these opinions acknowledge, and there \\nis no rational basis for declaring that such bias extends only to parties who are unpopular government offi-\\ncials. Indeed, this Court has  cautioned against \\u201cnarrow, \\ngrudging interpretation\\u201d of federal officer removal. Willingham v. Morgan , 395 U.S. 402, 407 (1969). \\nSimply put, \\u201c[t]he removal statute is an incident of fed-\\neral supremacy.\\u201d Murray v. Murray , 621 F.2d 103, 106 \\n(5th Cir. 1980). \\n States and municipalities are engaged in a cam-\\npaign through the courts to overturn \\u201cunpopular fed-\\neral laws.\\u201d Rather than recognizing the Constitution \\nand federal laws as supreme, governmental \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d plaintiffs are applying \\u201cnarrow, grudging\\u201d \\ninterpretation of the removal statute to seek to over-\\nturn federal law through imposing ostensible tort lia-bility in state courts. \\n18 \\n  It is hard to imagine a more striking case where \\nfear of state court bias could be a concern than is pre-\\nsented in the instant matter and similar cases unfold-\\ning across the nation. Stated otherwise and even more affirmatively, the hope  for state court bias is demon-\\nstrably at play in these case s, as shown in other records \\nobtained by Amicus  EPA through public records laws. \\n As documented, supra , by its own admission the \\nState of Rhode Island is pursuing its litigation to ob-tain a \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d for its officials\\u2019 \\nspending ambitions, having failed to convince the vot-\\ners\\u2019 elected representatives to provide one. Rhode Is-land\\u2019s circumstance in this respect differs not at all \\nfrom all such plaintiffs including in Baltimore . Both \\nsets of notes discussed, supra , specify Director Coit\\u2019s \\nemphasis on seeking this \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d \\nin \\u201cstate court.\\u201d All such plaintiffs are now moving \\nHeaven and earth to keep these matters out of the clutches of federal jurisdiction. \\n This objective of suing to make federal policy in \\nstate courts is a thematic cousin of the drive to use the \\ncourts when legislatures fail to enact plaintiffs\\u2019 desired \\npolicies, and is well-understood among the instant plaintiffs, Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, and by \\nthe legal teams for most similarly-situated govern-\\nment plaintiffs. That Rhode Island and the City of Bal-timore share not only claims and legal strategies but \\nlegal counsel, whose recruit ing team has emphasized \\nto targeted governmental entities the desire to keep these matters in state court as the \\u201cmore advantageous \\nvenue for these cases,\\u201d given this Court\\u2019s ruling in \\n19 \\n American Electric Power , raises concerns that the cli-\\nmate nuisance plaintiffs also  share the hope for state \\ncourt biases in the campaign to eliminate budgetary \\nshortfalls and otherwise make policy through tort liti-gation. \\n For example, and again turning to documents ob-\\ntained through open records laws, we see that, after \\nU.S. District Judge William Alsup dismissed the City \\nof Oakland\\u2019s \\u201cclimate nuisanc e\\u201d suit against many of \\nthe same defendants in June 2018,\\n11 a lobbyist hired to \\nassist with recruiting more governmental plaintiffs for \\nSher Edling12 passed along a note of encouragement to \\n \\n 11 City of Oakland, et al. v.

G. Seth \\nPlatt is one of the network\\u2019s cons ultants, engaged to help lobby \\nFlorida municipalities to file suit similar to the State\\u2019s. At the time of the correspondence cited herein, Platt was a registered lobbyist for the Institute for Gove rnance & Sustainable Development \\n(\\u201cIGSD\\u201d) (www.igsd.org) (see search able index of lobbying regis-\\ntrations at ftlweb01app.azurewebsites.us/Ethicstrac/Lobbyists.aspx). Platt worked with IGSD and others  pitching municipalities to file \\n\\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation against energy interests, with First Circuit and Fourth Circuit plaintiffs\\u2019 counsel Sher Edling. \\n On July 27, 2018 Fort Lauderdale Interim City Attorney \\nAlain Boileau wrote Mayor Dean Trantalis, copying other aides, in pertinent part: \\n\\u201cMayor . . .

While recruiting Fort Lauderdale to file a climate nuisance action similar to the instant matter, Platt of-\\nfered \\u201ccontext for Dean and Alain\\u2019s consideration\\u201d in an email to Mayor Dean Trantalis, City Atto rney Boileau, and Mayor\\u2019s Chief \\nof Staff Scott Wyman. This was specifically in response to U.S. District Judge Alsup\\u2019s June 2018 opinion dismissing certain mu-\\nnicipalities\\u2019 \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation on the grounds that the courts were not the proper place to deal with such global issues.  \\n In another email, City Attorney Alan Boileau writes to \\nMayor Trantalis, \\u201cThe governmental plaintiffs are essentially pursuing liability through common law claims at a local level for a global (and not exclusively do mestic) problem upon which the \\njudiciary is taking the position that the issue has been and should be relegated to the exec utive and legislative branches. \\nhttps://climatelitigationwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ CLK_789_2018-Em ails-2nd-FTL-Production.pdf. \\n \\n15 Matt Dempsey, \\u201cUCLA Professor\\u2019 s Role In Climate Litiga-\\ntion Raises Transparency Questions,\\u201d Western Wire, November 27, 2018, https://westernwire.net/u cla-professors-role-in-climate-\\nlitigation-raises-transparency-questions/. \\n \\n16 \\u201c \\u2018[U.S. District Judge William Alsup\\u2019s] decision is irrele-\\nvant from a legal perspective,\\u2019 Carlson said, as long as these cases stay in state courts.

(\\u201cLDF\\u201d) has strived to secure \\nthe constitutional promise of equality for all people. Petitioner asks the Court to reconsider an important question about the Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s reach, which, more than any other constitutional provision, \\nembodies our Nation\\u2019s commitment to equal justice \\nunder the law.  \\nLDF has been at the forefront of efforts to enforce \\nthe Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s promise of equality. See, e.g. , Cooper v. Aaron , 358 U.S. 1 (1958);\\n Brown v. \\nBd. of Educ. of Topeka , 347 U.S. 483 (1954) . LDF has \\nalso led the fight of eradicating discrimination from jury verdicts. See, e.g. , Ham v. South Carolina , 409 \\nU.S. 524 (1973)\\n; Alexander v. Louisiana , 405 U.S. 625 \\n(1972) ; Swain v. Alabama , 380 U.S. 202 (1965). \\nLDF submits this brief to aid the Court in \\ndeciding whether the Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s Due Process Clause incorporates the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement against the States.\\n1  \\n  \\n                                                \\n1 Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.6, counsel for amicus \\ncuriae state that no counsel for a party authored this brief in \\nwhole or in part and that no person other than amicus curiae , its \\nmembers, or its counsel made a monetary contribution to the preparation or submission of this brief. All parties have consented to the filing of this brief. \\n2 \\n \\n SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \\nAfter the Civil War, Congress passed the \\nFourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of \\n1875 to protect the rights of newly freed African \\nAmericans. One of the rights protected by those provisions was the right to  serve on a jury. Indeed, \\nthis Court affirmed the centrality of jury service to the citizenship of African Americans 140 years ago. See \\nStrauder v. West Virginia , 100 U.S. 303 (1879). \\nThen, in 1898, white Louisianans convened a \\nconstitutional convention. Their goal was to craft a constitution that would \\u201cestablish the supremacy of \\nthe white race . . . to the extent to which it could be \\nlegally and constitutionally done . . . .\\u201d Louisiana \\nratified its non-unanimous jury provision at this convention to help achieve its goal of cementing white supremacy. While federal law made it illegal to exclude Black people from jury service, the delegates \\npassed the non-unanimous jury provision to nullify \\nthe votes of Black jurors and allow white jurors to more easily convict Black defendants. \\nLouisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury provision \\nworked exactly as intended. Up until 2018, when \\nLouisianans voted to remove the non-unanimous jury \\nprovision from their constitution, Black defendants were more likely to be convicted by non-unanimous juries than white defendants, and Black jurors were more likely than white jurors to be in the dissent. \\nThus, despite jury service being a hallmark of \\nAmerican citizenship, for ov er a century, Louisiana\\u2019s \\n3 \\n \\n non-unanimous jury provision effectively undermined \\nBlack participation on juries. \\nLouisiana has been permitted to thwart the \\nintent of the Reconstruction Congress in this manner because of this Court\\u2019s decision in Apodaca v. Oregon , \\n406 U.S. 404 (1972), in which Justice Powell\\u2019s idiosyncratic view that the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement does not apply to the States \\nwas the controlling opinion. Th is is the rare case in \\nwhich stare decisis should not control, and this Court \\nshould hold that the Sixth Amendment requires state juries\\u2014like federal juries\\u2014to be unanimous. \\nARGUMENT \\nI. THE HISTORY OF THE FOURTEENTH \\nAMENDMENT COMPELS THE INCORPORATION OF THE SIXTH AMENDMENT UNANIMOUS JURY TRIAL \\nRIGHT.  \\nThis Court recently reiterated that \\u201c[a] Bill of \\nRights protection is inco rporated . . . if it is \\n\\u2018fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty,\\u2019 or \\n\\u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\\u2019s history and tradition.\\u2019\\u201d  \\nTimbs v. Indiana , 139 S. Ct. 682, 687 (2019) (quoting \\nMcDonald v. Chicago , 561 U.S. 742, 767 (2010)). \\nAccordingly, when determining whether a provision of the Bill of Rights is \\u201cfundamental\\u201d or \\u201cdeeply rooted,\\u201d the Court reckons with the historical context \\nof the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e.g. , McDonald , \\n561 U.S. at 770-78 (explicating the position of \\u201cthe \\n4 \\n \\n Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth \\nAmendment\\u201d); id. at 776 (relying on \\u201c[e]vidence from \\nthe period immediately following the ratification of \\nthe Fourteenth Amendment\\u201d); Timbs , 139 S. Ct. at \\n688 (same). An examination of this history compels the incorporation of the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement. \\nIn the aftermath of the Civil War, Southern \\nwhites were neither prepared nor willing to accept the \\n\\u201cfundamentally altered . . . racial status quo in the \\nSouth.\\u201d\\n2 The Thirteenth Amendment\\u2019s ratification \\nabolished slavery in 1865.3 Nevertheless, recalcitrant \\nSouthern states persisted in \\u201csubjugat[ing] newly \\nfreed slaves and maintain[ing] the prewar racial \\nhierarchy.\\u201d Timbs , 139 S. Ct. at 688. Between  1865 \\nand 1866, Southern legislatures accomplished this by passing discriminatory statutes, known as Black \\nCodes, which \\u201creduce[d] blacks to a status somewhere \\nbetween that of slaves (which they no longer were) \\nand full free people (which most white southerners opposed).\\u201d\\n4 And Black Codes governed a wide range of \\naspects of everyday life, including the extent of African American access to the courtroom.\\n5 For \\n                                                \\n2 Paul Finkelman, John Bingham and the Background to the \\nFourteenth Amendment , 36 Akron L.

Pol. & Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 389, 402-03 \\n5 \\n \\n example, under the Alabama Black Code, while Black \\npeople were allowed to testify in court, they were limited to testifying \\u201conly in cases in which freedmen, \\nfree negroes and mulattoes are parties.\\u201d\\n6  Other \\nstates passed similar Black Codes, all of which had the same effect: Black people could not testify in civil \\ncases between white people or in criminal cases in \\nwhich a white person harmed another white person.\\n7  \\n\\u201c[T]he law in effect declared that blacks were not \\n\\u2018equal\\u2019 to whites and that their testimony was not as \\u2018good\\u2019 as that of whites.\\u201d\\n8 \\nIt was against this backdrop of state-legislated \\nrefusal \\u201cto accept that the freed people were entitled \\nto liberty, equality, or even fundamental legal \\nrights,\\u201d9 that the need for Congress to create legal \\nprotections for formerly enslaved African Americans \\nbecame clear. In December 1865, Congress created \\nthe Joint Committee on Reconstruction, and \\nauthorized the Committee \\u201cto investigate conditions \\nin the South.\\u201d10  \\nThis investigation showed that with respect to \\nformerly enslaved Black people, \\u201cit was impossible to abandon them, without securing them their rights as \\n                                                \\n(2004).

As this Court said in Duncan v. Louisiana , \\u201c[t]he \\nguarantees of jury trial . . . reflect a profound \\njudgment about the way in which law should be enforced and justice administered.\\u201d 391 U.S. 145, 155 (1968).

Because of its long-\\nunderstood importance,\\n26 the right to jury trial was \\n                                                \\n23 Albert W. Alschuler & Andrew G.

The story of two Black Louisianans who recently served as jurors\\u2014Willie Newton and Bobbie Howard\\u2014compellingly illustrates this point.\\n64 \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard were both born and \\nraised in the small town of Houma, in Terrebonne Parish; the same town where Evangelisto Ramos \\nworked. Mr. Newton, who is 72 years old, runs a \\nfamily business selling burial vaults.

Everything quoted is from their interviews with counsel unless attributed otherwise. \\n19 \\n \\n year-old Mr. Howard has his own accounting practice. \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard both attended segregated schools growing up. In fact, they went to \\nthe same high school, as there was only one in the \\nParish that educated Black children. \\nIn 2014, two years before Mr. Ramos faced trial \\nfor second-degree murder, Mr. Newton and Mr. Howard were selected to serve on the jury for the trial \\nof Matthew Allen, a 20-year-old Black man also \\naccused of second-degree murder. The prosecution\\u2019s \\ntheory was that Mr. Allen intentionally shot and killed the victim; Mr. Allen\\u2019 s defense to the charge \\nwas that he acted in self-defense.\\n65 Mr. Newton and \\nMr. Howard were the only Black jurors. The other ten \\njurors on Mr. Allen\\u2019s jury were white.  \\nMr. Newton vividly recalled  his feelings when he \\nsaw the jury\\u2019s composition: \\u201cBobby and I saw from the beginning that our vote wasn\\u2019t going to matter. We \\nwere outnumbered.\\u201d \\u201cI could have just stayed home.\\u201d \\n\\u201cAin\\u2019t no difference we can make.\\u201d Mr. Newton felt \\ndoubly distraught when he saw that Mr. Allen had a \\u201cbad judge\\u201d who had been reprimanded for wearing blackface.\\n66 Mr. Newton thought to himself, \\u201cBuddy, \\nyou\\u2019re doomed.\\u201d \\n                                                \\n65 See State v. Allen , 2015-0675, 2015 WL 6951570, at *2 (La. Ct. \\nApp. 2015).  \\n66 In 2004, Judge Timothy Ellender was suspended for wearing \\nblackface, handcuffs, and a jail jumpsuit to a Halloween party.  \\nSee Seth Fox, Houma Judge Suspended for Wearing Blackface \\nHalloween Costume , Houma Today (Dec. 13, 2014), \\n20 \\n \\n Reflecting back, Mr. Newton and Mr. Howard \\nthought Mr. Allen\\u2019s race worked against him with the white jurors. \\u201cThey see a Black defendant in a drug \\ndeal and maybe think \\u2018he\\u2019s hustling corner to corner, \\nlet\\u2019s teach him a lesson,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Howard speculated. Mr. Newton echoed this sentiment: \\u201cI think they saw him \\nas a potential threat to the community.\\u201d  \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard looked at Mr. Allen \\ndifferently. They saw a young man who may have \\nmade a mistake, but who still had a life ahead of him. \\nMr. Howard thought these differing perspectives could be due to the fact \\u201ctheir life experiences were different.\\u201d  \\nAfter listening intently to the evidence, both Mr. \\nHoward and Newton favored finding Mr. Allen guilty of manslaughter. \\u201cI thought about his age. I thought he deserved a second chance,\\u201d Mr. Howard said quietly. Mr. Newton confirmed that he \\u201cnever thought \\nit was second-degree murder\\u201d and proposed to his \\nfellow jurors that Mr. Allen should be convicted of \\nmanslaughter, not murder.  \\nDeliberations gave both men hope that at least \\nsome of the white jurors would see the evidence their \\nway and would find Mr. Allen guilty of manslaughter, \\nnot murder. Mr. Howard recalled that one juror, a white woman, seemed to be leaning in favor of manslaughter going into lunch. Mr. Newton remembered there being two or three white jurors \\n                                                \\nhttps://www.houmatoday.com/article/DA/20041213/News/60809\\n9465/HC/.   \\n21 \\n \\n who seemed to think manslaughter was the just \\nconviction. \\nThings took a turn after lunch, however. Mr. \\nHoward recounted that he and Mr. Newton had lunch together, while the white jurors ate together. When they returned from lunch, all ten white jurors wanted to vote for second-degree murder; there was no convincing them otherwise, \\u201ceveryone was set in their \\nways.\\u201d  \\nMr. Newton\\u2019s prediction that his vote wouldn\\u2019t \\nmatter proved prescient. Th e jury convicted Mr. Allen \\nof second-degree murder by a vote of 10-2. All ten \\nwhite jurors voted for guilt. Mr. Newton and Mr. \\nHoward voted not guilty. \\nWhat took place troubled Mr. Howard and Mr. \\nNewton. Mr. Howard recalled: \\u201cI pretty much felt sorry for the young man, to tell you the truth.\\u201d Mr. \\nNewton was more shaken: \\u201cIt hurt me real bad when \\nI looked at that young man, and I looked at his mother and father, and I knew they weren\\u2019t going to see him again, not unless they go up to Angola.\\u201d\\n67 Indeed, Mr. \\nNewton felt the effects of the trial long after it was \\nover: \\u201cWhen I left that jury, it took me a couple of \\nweeks to get myself together. Serving on that jury \\ntook something out of me.\\u201d Mr. Allen, who entered prison for a crime he a when he was only 20, continues to serve a life sentence in Angola Prison.   \\n                                                \\n67 Adelson et al., supra note 57. \\n22 \\n \\n Mr. Newton realized that what happened in Mr. \\nAllen\\u2019s trial probably happened in many others, causing him to wonder, \\u201cHow many others had passed \\nthis way . . . and got the same treatment this boy got.\\u201d \\nThe trial, Mr. Newton explained, made him feel like his \\u201cvoice didn\\u2019t matter,\\u201d \\u201ca second-class citizen.\\u201d  \\nThis experience confirmed for Mr. Newton that \\nLouisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury system was unfair to \\nBlack defendants and Black jurors. In his opinion, the \\nprosecutors \\u201cfound a way to get around the system\\u201d \\nby limiting the number of Black people on Mr. Allen\\u2019s jury to two, knowing they only needed ten votes for a conviction. The trial shook Mr. Newton\\u2019s confidence in \\nthe fairness of Louisiana\\u2019s justice system: \\u201cI know I \\ncouldn\\u2019t sit there and think I\\u2019d get a fair trial.\\u201d  \\nMr. Newton took solace in the fact Louisiana \\nvoters repealed the non-unanimous jury provision last year.\\n68 He expressed that while he does think that \\n\\u201cjustice was served\\u201d during Mr. Allen\\u2019s trial, he felt \\n\\u201cencouraged\\u201d and \\u201cempowered\\u201d to serve on a jury now that his vote was guaranteed to matter. Mr. Howard \\nsaid that he, too, is ready to perform his \\u201ccivic duty\\u201d \\nand serve on a jury under Louisiana\\u2019s new unanimous jury scheme.  \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard\\u2019s experience is a \\nstark example of the indign ities inflicted upon Black \\npeople by Louisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury provision. It is a reminder that, until last year, Louisiana\\u2019s non-\\nunanimous jury system worked the way its racist \\n                                                \\n68 Oregon is now the only state with a non-unanimous jury \\nprovision. \\n23 \\n \\n proponents intended\\u2014to more easily convict Black \\ndefendants and to silence Black jurors.

While debating the extent to \\nwhich the Constitution should enshrine protections for religious freedom during the First Congress, \\nRepresentative Daniel Carroll of Maryland\\u2014one of \\nthe few Catholics among the Constitution\\u2019s \\nFramers\\u2014remarked \\u201cthe rights of conscience are, in \\ntheir nature, of peculiar delicacy, and will little bear \\nthe gentlest touch of governmental hand.\\u201d 1 Annals \\nof Cong. 757-58 (Joseph Gales ed., 1834) (Aug. 15, 1789). \\nNowhere are the rights of the religious more \\ndelicate than when they intersect with the freedom \\nto put faith into action, belief into words. If the \\nrobust religious freedom protections guaranteed by \\nour Constitution are to have any meaning, they must \\nbe capable of shielding a sincere religious believer from being coerced into speaking against the core \\ntenants of her faith. To hold otherwise would be to \\npermit the heavy hand of government to extinguish \\nreligious practice. This the Constitution will not \\nallow. \\nThe Founders understood that the First \\nAmendment, as drafted, protected all religious sects in their right to speak freely in accordance with their \\nfaith. Indeed, the Founding Generation believed \\nprotections for religious lib erty to be of utmost \\nimport. Since its founding, America has been gripped \\n 3 \\nin debate over religious liberty. Even before the \\ncolonies declared their independence, there were \\nenergetic discussions over the bounds of religious \\ntoleration versus a full freedom to exercise religion \\n(with only limited exceptions). Ultimately, the \\nConstitution\\u2019s drafters settled on James Madison\\u2019s \\nview of an unalienable right to practice one\\u2019s \\nreligious faith. Owed to an understanding that the Governor of the Universe supersedes any earthly \\nauthority, religious convictions were understood to \\ncommand greater deference than mere personal \\nopinions. Where opinion was required to yield to the \\nlaw, tensions between law and religious belief often \\nresulted in exemption for the believer. \\nThe Founding Generation also viewed religious \\nliberty as encompassing more  than mere matters of \\nconscience or decisions on the rightness or wrongness \\nof acts. Instead, the full ex ercise of religion offered a \\nright to act in accordance with one\\u2019s faith and, \\nnecessarily, included protection from government \\ncompelled speech that violated a believer\\u2019s firmly \\nheld religious convictions. This distinction was \\nperhaps most clearly expressed in the early colonies\\u2019 \\nanti-Catholic prejudices. In colonial Georgia, for example, while all worshipers were vested by its \\nCharter with a liberty of conscience, Catholics were \\nexpressly excluded from protections for the more \\nrobust free exercise of religion. McConnell, The \\nOrigins and Historical Understanding of Free \\nExercise of Religion, 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1409, 1489-90 \\n(1989) (hereinafter McConnell, Origins). \\nInformed by the debates and experiences of their \\ntime, the Founders opted to include among the Constitution\\u2019s protections the more extensive free \\n 4 \\nexercise of religion. In so doing, they extended the \\nmaximum protections available to all who professed \\nbelief in a Universal Sovereign. These protections, it \\nwas understood, included a right to act out belief and \\nto speak, or refrain from speaking, freely, in \\naccordance with faith. \\nWith this understanding as background, it is \\nclear the First Amendment provides dual protections for religious expression (or non-expression) in its \\nguarantees of free speech and free religious exercise. \\nThis reality compels the \",\n          \" \\n No. 19-1189 \\n================================================================================================================ \\nIn The \\nSupreme Court of the United States \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 --------------------------------- \\nBP P.L.C., et al., \\nPetitioners,        \\nv. \\nMAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE, \\nRespondent.        \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 --------------------------------- \\nOn Petition For Writ Of Certiorari \\nTo The United States Court Of Appeals \\nFor The Fourth Circuit  \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 --------------------------------- \\nBRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE  \\nENERGY POLICY ADVOCATES \\nIN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS \\nFILED BY CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 --------------------------------- \\nMATTHEW  D.

Religious observers have \\nwelcomed the relief from government oppression. No \\nlonger can religious believers be excluded solely \\nbecause of their religious identity. Free are the religious to express their religious views without fear \\nof government reprisal. This Court\\u2019s precedents have \\nbeen unequivocal: if government can achieve its \\nmeans without burdening religion, the Constitution \\nalmost always requires that it must. \\nAnother truism is derived from this Court\\u2019s \\nprecedents. When religious liberty concerns are coupled with free expression, the Constitution \\ndemands the most exacting scrutiny. That is because \\nthe First Amendment, as understood from the \\nFounding, provides special protection for the \\n 5 \\nreligious, their right to speak freely, and their right \\nto refrain from speaking. Distinct from pure \\ncommercial speech, religious speech demands a \\nhigher constitutional protection. That is why, to \\nAmicus Curiae\\u2019s knowledge, government compelled \\nreligious speech has never been held to survive strict \\nscrutiny. \\nAgainst this backdrop, the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s opinion \\ncannot stand. Although purporting to apply strict scrutiny, the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s analysis is rife with \\nflaws, each one fatal to the court\\u2019s conclusion. From \\nthe outset, the Tenth Circuit failed to recognize the \\npreferred status of Ms. Smith\\u2019s free speech rights, \\ngrounded as they are in her religious beliefs. This \\nfailure is only compounded by the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s lethargic narrow-tailoring analysis. Far from the \\nexacting analysis this Court requires, the Tenth \\nCircuit settles into a now familiar pattern to those of \\nfaith\\u2014ostracizing Ms. Smith from society because of \\nher religious identity. \\nOnce again, this Court must reverse yet another \\nassault on religious freedom by declaring that where, as here, free speech and religion intersect, \\nconstitutional protections are at their greatest. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 6 \\nARGUMENT \\nI. AS ORIGINALLY UNDERSTOOD , THE FIRST \\nAMENDMENT PROTECTED THE RIGHT OF THE \\nRELIGIOUS TO SPEAK AND TO REMAIN SILENT . \\nThe First Amendment is \\u201cunique in form among \\namendments to the Constitution.\\u201d2 It is drafted, not \\nas a grant of privileges or rights to the people, but as \\na disability on Congress\\u2019 ability to act. Report to the Attorney General, supra  note 2, at 15\\u201316. In its \\nentirety, the First Amendment reads: \\nCongress shall make no law respecting \\nan establishment of religion, or \\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; or \\nabridging the freedom of speech, or of \\nthe press; or the right of the people \\npeaceably to assemble, and to petition \\nthe Government for a redress of grievances.  \\nU.S.\\n Const., Amdt. 1. \\nIn barring certain kinds of laws, the First \\nAmendment recognizes a pre-existing \\u201cimmun[ity] from such legislative action.\\u201d Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral, supra note 2, at 16. This reflects an \\nunderstanding by the Founding Generation that these \\u201care pre-existent rights\\u2014inalienable rights\\u2014\\n                                           \\n2 O f f i c e  o f  L e g a l  P o l i c y ,  D e p t  o f  J u s t i c e ,  R e p o r t  t o  t h e  \\nAttorney General: Religious Li berty Under the Free Exercise \\nClause at 15 (1986) (hereinafter Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral). \\n 7 \\nand not mere civil privileges conferred by a \\nbenevolent sovereign.\\u201d Id. \\nTaken together, the text, history, and philosophy \\nof the First Amendment establish the principle that \\n\\u201cthe government has no right to interfere with the \\nfree exercise of religion\\u201d unless the \\u201cgovernment \\naction is necessary to prevent manifest danger to the \\nexistence of the state; to protect public peace, safety, \\nand order; or to secure the religious liberty of \\nothers.\\u201d Id., at v. And, even then, only if the \\ngovernment deploys \\u201cthe least restrictive means \\nnecessary to protect these interests.\\u201d Id. This is true \\nas a matter of the First Amendment\\u2019s Religious Liberty Clauses. And because freedom of religion \\ncannot be divorced from freedom of expression, it is \\neven more true when the government tries to force a \\nbeliever to speak in a way that cannot be reconciled \\nwith her religious convictions. \\nA. Religious liberty was profoundly \\nimportant to the Founding Generation; \\nreligious convictions were understood \\nto receive greater deference than mere \\npersonal opinion. \\n1. The Founding Generation was uniquely \\nattuned to issues regarding the proper relationship \\nbetween religion and government. Indeed, at the time of America\\u2019s founding there was \\u201can intense and \\ncontroversial theoretical debate\\u201d of these issues \\ninvolving \\u201c[m]ost of the great political thinkers of the \\nperiod.\\u201d McConnell, Origins, at 1430. These thinkers \\ninformed the Founders\\u2019 own debates on the issue and \\nundoubtedly \\u201cinfluenced the American solution to \\nthe problem.\\u201d Id.  \\n 8 \\nJohn Locke, perhaps more than any other \\nphilosopher who contributed to the ideas \\nunderpinning America\\u2019s founding, provided the \\n\\u201cmost extensive\\u201d discussion of religion and most \\ndirectly influenced the Framers\\u2019 drafting of the First \\nAmendment. Id. Locke was an early and influential \\ntheoretical thinker and advocate for religious freedom. Id., at 1431. In his view \\u201creligious rivalry \\nand intolerance\\u201d were \\u201camong the most important of political problems,\\u201d and \\u201c[r]eligious intolerance was inconsistent both with public peace and with good \\ngovernment.\\u201d Id. \\nLocke\\u2019s solution, however, was an \\u201cunderstanding \\nof religious toleration,\\u201d that \\u201cexpressly precludes free \\nexercise exemptions.\\u201d Id., at 1435. To Locke, when \\n\\u201cindividual conscience conflicts with the governmental policy, the government will always \\nprevail and the individual will always be forced to \\nsubmit or suffer the punishment.\\u201d Id. Locke\\u2019s \\ninfluence on the drafters of the First Amendment makes it all the more remarkable that his view did \\nnot triumph with America\\u2019s founding. \\nThe American Revolution upended the \\npreexisting relationship between religion and government, especially in states where the Anglican \\nChurch had the most influence. Id., at 1436. \\n\\u201cAmerica was in the wake of a great religious \\nrevival,\\u201d that brought with it a \\u201cdrive for religious \\nfreedom.\\u201d Id., at 1437\\u201338. Along with this drive came \\na push from \\u201creligious supporters of disestablishment and free exercise\\u201d to enshrine \\n\\u201cconstitutional protections\\u201d for religious freedoms \\u201cat the federal level.\\u201d Id., at 1440. \\n 9 \\nThis movement was encapsulated in debate \\nsurrounding the religious liberty clause in Virginia\\u2019s \\n1776 Bill of Rights. When George Mason proposed \\nusing the Lockean phrase \\u201ctoleration of religion,\\u201d \\nJames Madison objected, complaining that the \\nphrase implied an act of legislative grace (which, to \\nLocke, it did). Id. , at 1443. Madison was not alone \\namong the Founding Generation in rejecting this concept. George Washin gton and Thomas Paine \\nsimilarly eschewed \\u201ctoleration,\\u201d decrying its \\nimplication of government \\u201cindulgence\\u201d rather than a \\nfundamental, preexisting right. Id., at 1443\\u201344. \\nMoreover, Madison objected to Mason\\u2019s proposal \\nbecause it excepted from even the \\u201ctoleration\\u201d of \\nreligious freedom any instance where \\u201cunder color of \\nreligion any man disturb the peace, the happiness, or \\nsafety of society.\\u201d See G. Hunt, James Madison and \\nReligious Liberty, 1 Ann. Rep. Am. Hist. A. 163, 166 \\n(1901). It was Madison\\u2019s belief that such phrasing \\n\\u201cmight easily be so twisted as to oppress religious \\nsects under the excuse that they disturbed \\u2018the \\npeace, the happiness, or safety of society.\\u2019\\u201d Id. \\nMadison\\u2019s objections were heard by Virginia\\u2019s \\nassembly. As adopted, Virginia\\u2019s Bill of Rights \\npromised that all \\u201care equally entitled to the free \\nexercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience,\\u201d and reminded only \\u201cthat\\n it is the mutual \\nduty of all to practice Christian forbearance, love, and charity towards each other.\\u201d Report to the \\nAttorney General, supra  note 2, at 102\\u201303. \\n2. This early debate between Madison and Mason \\nbears witness to what this Court has long noted\\u2014\\nthat Madison was \\u201cthe leading architect of the \\n 10\\nreligion clauses of the First Amendment.\\u201d Hosanna-\\nTabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v. \\nEEOC , 565 U.S. 171, 184 (2012) (internal quotation \\nmarks omitted). Madison\\u2019s rejection of religious \\ntolerance in favor of full and free religious expression permeates his Memorial and Remonstrance . \\nExplaining that \\u201c[t]he Religion then of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every \\nman,\\u201d Madison understood that it is not just \\u201cthe \\nright of every man to exercise it as these may \\ndictate,\\u201d but further \\u201cthe duty of every man to render \\nto the Creator such homage, and such only, as he \\nbelieves to be acceptable to him.\\u201d J. Madison, \\nMemorial and Remonstrance \\u00a7 1 (1785), reprinted in \\nEverson v. Bd. of Educ. , 330 U.S. 1, 64 (1947). This \\nright, Madison admonished, \\u201cis in its nature an unalienable right.\\u201d Id. \\nMadison expounded his view that \\u201c[t]his duty is \\nprecedent both in order of time and degree of \\nobligation, to the claims of Civil Society.\\u201d Id. Before \\nanyone is \\u201ca member of Civil Society,\\u201d they are \\u201cconsidered as a subject of the Governor of the \\nUniverse.\\u201d Id. For this reason, \\u201cin matters of \\nReligion, no man\\u2019s right is abridged by the institution of Civil Society.\\u201d Id. But Madison went \\nfurther. \\u201c[I]f religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that \\nof the Legislative Body.\\u201d Id., at \\u00a7 2, reprinted in \\nEverson , 330 U.S., at 65. Legislators who \\n\\u201cencroach[]\\u201d on the rights of the people, Madison \\nsaid, \\u201cexceed the commission from which they derive their authority, and are Tyrants.\\u201d Id. \\nRecognizing that Madison\\u2019s Memorial and \\nRemonstrance is not law, see City of Boerne v. Flores , \\n 11\\n521 U.S. 507, 541 (1997) (Scalia, J., concurring), it \\nnonetheless offers a clear understanding of why the \\nFounding Generation thought it so crucial to \\nmemorialize the inalienable freedom of religion in \\nthe First Amendment. And Madison\\u2019s defense of the \\nAmerican conception of religious liberty merely \\nechoed the prevalent thought at the founding \\u201cof the \\ndifference between religious faith and other forms of human judgment.\\u201d McConnell, Origins, at 1496. \\nAt the Founding, the prevailing view was that the \\n\\u201copinions of individuals\\u201d can not take \\u201cprecedence \\nover the decisions of civil society.\\u201d Id. The same was \\nnot true for religious convictions. \\u201cConflicts arising from religious convictions were conceived not as a \\nclash between the judgment of the individual and of \\nthe state, but as a conflict between earthly and \\nspiritual sovereigns.\\u201d Id. In those instances, the \\nperson holding the religious conviction \\u201cwas not seen as the instigator of the conflict; the believer was simply caught between the inconsistent demands of \\ntwo rightful authorities, through no fault of his own.\\u201d \\nId. This view is essential to understanding the \\nFounders\\u2019 belief that \\u201cfreedom of religion is unalienable because it is a duty to God and not a \\nprivilege of the individual.\\u201d Id., at 1497. \\n3. Bolstering this understanding, the historical \\nrecord surrounding adoption of the Bill of Rights \\nsuggests that the First Amendment\\u2019s use of the term \\u201creligion\\u201d was a deliberate choice. See McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1488. Although \\u201c[t]he recorded debates \\nin\\u201d both chambers of Congress \\u201ccast little light on the \\nmeaning of the free exercise clause,\\u201d looking at \\nsuccessive drafts of the clause from its consideration \\nand debate in the First Congress are especially \\n 12\\nenlightening. Id., at 1481, 1483. While earlier drafts \\nof the First Amendment used the phrase \\u201crights of \\nconscience,\\u201d the final version that emerged enshrined in the First Amendment a protection for the \\u201cfree \\nexercise of religion.\\u201d Id., at 1488. This phrasing lends \\nfurther support to the Founders\\u2019 understanding of religious freedoms. \\nTo the Founders, \\u201c[b]elief in a Supreme Being \\nwas\\u201d essential to \\u201creligion.\\u201d Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral, supra  note 2, at 9. Indeed, \\u201c[t]he historical \\nmaterials uniformly equate \\u2018religion\\u2019 with belief in God or in gods.\\u201d McConnell, Origins, at 1493. These references \\u201ccan be extended without distortion to \\ntranscendent extrapersonal authorities not \\nenvisioned in traditionally theistic terms\\u201d\\u2014for \\nexample, Madison\\u2019s use of \\u201cCreator,\\u201d \\u201cGovernor of \\nthe Universe,\\u201d and \\u201cUniversal Sovereign,\\u201d imply \\u201can attempt at a definition more compendious than the \\nfamiliar Judeo-Christian God, but it retains the distinction between transcendent authority and \\npersonal judgment.\\u201d Id.  \\nReligion, as understood by the Founders and \\nexpressed in the First Amendment, then, is best \\ndefined to encompass \\u201ca system of beliefs, whether \\npersonally or institutionally held, prompted by the \\nacceptance of transcendent realities or \\nacknowledging extratemporal actions.\\u201d Report to the \\nAttorney General, supra note 2, at 26\\u201327. This \\ninterpretation of religion is both accurate to the Founders\\u2019 understanding and consistent with their view that religion encompasses \\u201cduties that were \\nbeyond the jurisdiction of the state either to \\nprescribe or to proscribe.\\u201d Id., at 9. To the Founders, \\nreligion encompassed a subservience to a \\n 13\\n\\u201ctranscendent reality,\\u201d which if abandoned could \\nunleash \\u201cextratemporal consequences.\\u201d Id., at 29. \\nThis explains their motivation to preserve a robust freedom from government \\u201cinterfere[nce] with such \\nbeliefs or duties.\\u201d Id. \\nB. The Founding Generation\\u2019s understanding of religious liberty \\nencompassed protection for believers \\nfrom compelled speech that violates \\nfirmly held religious beliefs. \\n1. The least controversial point about the phrase \\n\\u201cfree exercise\\u201d is that \\u201cby definition, the words denote action or activity.\\u201d Id., at 19. To the Founders, \\nreligious liberty undoubtedly included \\u201creligiously motivated conduct  as well as belief.\\u201d McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1488 (emphasis added). This point bears emphasis because of this Court\\u2019s history rejecting \\nsuch a reading. See  Reynolds v. United States , 98 \\nU.S. 145, 164 (1878); but see Fulton v. City of Phila. , \\n141 S. Ct. 1868, 1913 (2021) (Alito, J., concurring) \\n(noting \\u201c[t]he Court ha[s] repudiated that distinction\\u201d in Reynolds  \\u201cthat the Free Exercise \\nClause protects beliefs, not conduct\\u201d). \\nIn substituting the \\u201crights of conscience\\u201d in favor \\nof a protection for the \\u201cfree exercise of religion,\\u201d the \\nFramer\\u2019s chose a phrase that \\u201cstrongly connoted \\naction,\\u201d in place of one that suggested mere opinion \\nor belief. McConnell, Origins, at 1489. Leading \\ndictionaries of that era defined \\u201cexercise\\u201d to include \\n\\u201c[l]abour of the body,\\u201d \\u201c[t]ask; that which one is \\nappointed to perform,\\u201d \\u201c[a]ct of divine worship, \\nwhether public or private,\\u201d or \\u201c[t]o use or practice.\\u201d See id.  (collecting dictionary definitions). Conscience, \\n 14\\non the other hand, was more likely to imply a \\n\\u201cnatural knowledge, or the faculty that decides on \\nthe right or wrong of actions.\\u201d Id. (quoting N. \\nWebster, A Dictionary of The English Language 301 (New Haven 1807)). \\nParticularly instructive on this distinction is the \\nGeorgia Charter of 1732. The Charter included \\u201ca \\nliberty of conscience allowe d in the worship of God, \\nto all persons,\\u201d but reserved the more exclusive right to \\u201ca free exercise of religion,\\u201d only to \\u201call such persons, except papists.\\u201d Id., at 1489\\u201390. By granting \\nCatholics only a liberty of conscience, but not the free exercise of religion, the Georgia Charter necessarily \\nreserved a fuller right to non-Catholic worshipers. \\nOne scholar has observed that \\u201c[t]he most plausible \\nreading of the provision is that it permitted Catholics \\nto believe what they wished . . . but did not permit \\nthem to put their faith into action.\\u201d Id., at 1490. \\nBy including a full and robust \\u201cfree exercise of \\nreligion\\u201d within the First Amendment, the Founders understood that they were protecting not only the \\nright for the religious to believe what their faith \\ntaught, but to put those beliefs into action. To \\nconclude otherwise would be to \\u201ctrivialize the idea of \\nreligion by separating thought from life, faith from \\nworks.\\u201d Report to the Attorney General, supra note \\n2, at 31. Possessing \\u201ca right to believe something in one\\u2019s mind without the freedom to utter it, advocate it, or even translate it into life,\\u201d is hardly a \\nsubstantive freedom at all. Id., at 31\\u201332. \\n2. Consistent with the Founders\\u2019 understanding \\nof a robust religious liberty protection that included \\nthe right to act out your faith was the axiom that \\n 15\\naction naturally includes expression or the freedom \\nto refrain from expression that conflicts with belief. \\nAlthough early religious liberty controversies were \\nrelatively limited, the historical record includes \\nexamples of protections for religious exercise \\nintertwined with such expressive activity. \\nAn early source of common conflict, for example, \\narose around the issue of oath requirements. Oaths \\nserved as \\u201cthe principal means of ensuring honest \\ntestimony and solemnizing obligations.\\u201d McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1467. But many early religious sects \\nrefused to take an oath, believing it was in conflict \\nwith the teachings of the New Testament.3 Id. \\nBecause oaths were required before court testimony, this refusal often left these sincere religious objectors \\nwithout access to the court system. Id. \\nIn response, many of the early colonies adopted \\nalternatives, allowing relig ious dissenters to take a \\npledge or make an affirmation rather than to swear \\nan oath. Id., at 1467\\u201368 (\\u201cBy 1789, virtually all of the \\nstates had enacted oath exemptions.\\u201d). This simple solution permitted religious sects access to the court \\nsystem, without requiring them to act out of step \\n                                           \\n3 See Matthew 5:33-37 (\\u201cAgain, ye have heard that it hath \\nbeen said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, \\nbut shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: But I say unto you, \\nSwear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: Nor \\nby the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is \\nthe city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy \\nhead, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever \\nis more than these cometh of evil.\\u201d). \\n 16\\nwith their religious beliefs or to make an expression \\nthey found incompatible with their faith. \\nA still more extreme example of laws yielding to \\nexpressive activities of religious sects in the \\nFounding Generation can be found in colonial \\nGeorgia. There, the Trus tees of Georgia granted \\ncertain groups of religious refugees a general exemption from the laws that allowed them \\u201cto organize themselves in accordance with their own \\nfaith.\\u201d Id., at 1471. One historia n described one such \\ngroup from Salzburg\\u2014which formed the town of Ebenezer\\u2014as \\u201ca state within a state, a sort of \\ntheocracy under the direction of their minsters with \\ndaily conferences of the entire congregation in which \\nGod\\u2019s guidance was invoked at the beginning and the \\nend.\\u201d Id. Although these groups where required to \\nobey certain colonial laws pertaining to military service, property, and good governance, they were \\n\\u201cotherwise free to govern themselves.\\u201d Id. at 1471 \\nn.312 \\nAnother founding era example of religious \\nexemptions for expressive action appeared in North \\nCarolina and Maryland. There, laws exempted \\nmembers of certain religious sects from a \\nrequirement to remove their hat in court. Id. The \\nreligious objectors viewed such an action as \\u201ca form of obeisance to secular authority forbidden by their \\nreligion.\\u201d Id., at 1472. Rather than forcing members \\nof these sects to choose be tween access to the courts \\nor expressing themselves in violation of their religious beliefs, states offered an exemption. \\nWhile this example may seem trivial by today\\u2019s \\nstandards, it was very mu ch on the minds of the \\n 17\\nFounding Generation. At the time, \\u201c[o]ne of the most \\nnotorious courtroom cases of religious intolerance in \\nEngland involved William Penn\\u2019s refusal to remove \\nhis hat when he appeared in court\\u201d to face \\nindictment for speaking to  an unlawful assembly. Id. \\nWhen Penn refused to remove a court-furnished hat from his head in respect to the court, he was held in \\ncontempt and imprisoned. Id. This case attracted \\nsignificant attention in America, and undoubtedly influenced the exemptions passed in North Carolina and Maryland. Id. \\nIndeed, the importance of this exemption was \\ndemonstrated in debates over the Bill of Rights in \\nthe First Congress. Id., at 1472, n.320. In ridiculing \\nthe list of freedoms proposed to be protected, Theodore Sedgwick of Mass achusetts remarked \\u201cthey \\nmight have declared that a man should have a right to wear his hat if he pleased . . . but he would ask the \\ngentleman whether he thought it necessary to enter \\nthese trifles in a declaration of rights.\\u201d Id. (citation \\nomitted). With unmistakable reference to the Penn case, John Page of Virginia replied: \\nThe gentleman from \\nMassachusetts . . . objects to the clause, \\nbecause the right is of so trivial a \\nnature. He supposes it no more \\nessential than whether a man has a \\nright to wear his hat or not; but let me \\nobserve to him that such rights have \\nbeen opposed, and a man has been obliged to pull off his hat when he \\nappeared before the face of authority; \\npeople have also been prevented from \\n 18\\nassembling together on their lawful \\noccasions.  \\nId. (citation omitted). Certainly, the Founders were \\nacutely aware of the potential for abuse by \\nauthorities absent a robust religious liberty \\nprotection that clearly extended to actions, including \\nreligiously motivated expression or non-expression. \\n3. Taken together, the Free Exercise Clause and \\nthe Free Speech Clause elevate the freedom not to \\nspeak out of accordance with firmly held religious beliefs to the highest echelon of First Amendment \\nprotection. This conclusion is buttressed by the First \\nAmendment\\u2019s other guarantees\\u2014e.g., freedom of \\nassembly and freedom to petition the government. If \\nthe Free Exercise Clause conferred nothing more \\nthan a \\u201cright to express religious beliefs,\\u201d it would \\n\\u201cadd nothing to the First Amendment, since that right is fully protected by the right to assemble, \\nspeak, and publish.\\u201d Report to the Attorney General, \\nsupra note 2, at 19. Indeed, \\u201cbecause religious \\nexpression is doubly protected by the constitutional \\ntext\\u201d it would make little sense if it were \\u201cless \\nprotected in practice.\\u201d Id. , at 19, n.30. \\nThe examples cited above represent a clear \\nunderstanding by the Founding Generation that civil \\nlaws, even of general applicability, must yield when they conflict with religious expression or the freedom \\nto refrain from expression on the basis of a sincerely \\nheld religious belief. As it seems early legislative \\nbodies believed exemptions in such cases were \\nrequired by the principle of free exercise, it stands to \\nreason that the Framers understood \\u201csimilar \\napplications of the principle\\u201d would guide the courts \\n 19\\nin these cases, once \\u201centrusted with the \\nresponsibility of enforcing\\u201d First Amendment \\nguarantees. McConnell, Origins, at 1473. \\nAlthough there was a dearth of litigation over \\nreligious liberty protections in the early years of the \\nRepublic, what scarce examples exist support this \\nview. Consider, for example, the earliest state court \\nopinion addressing the issue of a religious liberty exemption, People v. Phillips . In that case, the court \\nheld that the New York Constitution protected a Catholic priest from compulsory testimony to \\nmatters learned while administering the Sacrament \\nof Confession. See  id., at 1504. \\nImportant to the Phillips court was the notion \\nthat requiring testimony from the priest to \\u201cwhat he \\nreceives in confession, is to declare that there shall \\nbe no penance; and this important branch of the Roman Catholic religion would be thus annihilated.\\u201d \\nId. (citation omitted). The court did not believe it was \\ncompatible with religious liberty to compel expression that would so eviscerate a core belief of Catholic faith. Rather than establishing a special \\nprivilege for adherents to the Catholic faith, though, \\nthe court viewed its actions as necessary to ensure \\nCatholics received the same  treatment as Protestants \\n(the dominant faith at the time) in the administration of their sacraments. Id., at 1504-05. \\nThe through line to the Founding Generation\\u2019s \\nunderstanding of religious liberty was a belief that \\nsuch freedom was without substantive meaning if it did not encompass expression, and non-expression, \\nrooted in religious belief. Noted Nineteenth Century \\n 20\\nConstitutional commentator, Michigan Supreme \\nCourt Justice Thomas Cooley, explained: \\nAn earnest believer usually regards it as his duty to propagate his opinions, \\nand to bring others to his views. To \\ndeprive him of this right is to take from \\nhim the power to perform what he \\nconsiders a most sacred obligation.  \\nT. Cooley, A Treatise on the Constitutional \\nLimitations 665 (7th ed. 1903). Put another way: \\nreligious freedom, as understood by the Founders, \\nnecessarily encompasses the freedom to put belief \\ninto action, to engage in expression consistent with \\nthe dogmas of your faith, and to refrain from \\nexpression that may engender extratemporal consequences. \\nII. T\\nHIS COURT \\u2019S PRECEDENTS \\u2014ESPECIALLY ITS \\nDEMANDING APPLICATION OF THE LEAST -\\nRESTRICTIVE MEANS TEST \\u2014DEMONSTRATE \\nAGREEMENT WITH THE FOUNDING GENERATION \\u2019S \\nROBUST RELIGIOUS LIBERTY PROTECTIONS . \\nThis Court has a commendable history of \\nrecognizing the principles discussed above. In \\nparticular, the Court\\u2019s recent religious liberty \\njurisprudence has been a welcome reprieve for \\nmembers of all faith communities who have been disheartened by the antagonism of some government \\nactors. See,  e.g., Espinoza v. Mont. Dept of Revenue , \\n140 S. Ct. 2246 (2020); Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. \\nColo. Civil Rights Comm\\u2019n , 138 S. Ct. 1719 (2018); \\nHosanna-Tabor , 565 U.S. 171. \\n 21\\nOf particular note is the Court\\u2019s insistence on a \\nforceful application of the strict scrutiny test to any \\nrestriction that burdens religious liberty. Indeed, \\u201cin \\nthis highly sensitive constitutional area, \\u2018only the \\ngravest abuses, endangering paramount interests, \\ngive occasion for permissible limitation.\\u2019\\u201d Sherbert v. \\nVerner , 374 U.S. 398, 406 (1963) (quoting Thomas v. \\nCollins, 323 U.S. 516, 530 (1945)). \\n1. A few examples illustrate the point. Consider \\nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. , where this \\nCourt considered a government-imposed contraceptive mandate on private employers who \\nbelieved such a requirement to be against their \\nreligious beliefs. 573 U.S. 682, 726 (2014).\\n4 While \\nassuming, without deciding, that the government\\u2019s \\ninterest was compelling, the Court nonetheless found \\nthat the least-restrictive-means standard was not \\nmet. Id., at 728. Identifying alternative solutions to \\nthe rigid mandate imposed by the government, the Court explained, \\u201c[t]he least-restrictive-means \\nstandard is exceptionally demanding.\\u201d Id.  As Justice \\nKennedy explained, religious freedom \\u201cimplicates more than just freedom of belief\\u201d; rather \\u201c[i]t means, too, the right to express those beliefs and to establish \\none\\u2019s religious (or nonreligious) self-definition in the \\npolitical, civic, and econ omic life of our larger \\n                                           \\n4 Hobby Lobby  was decided under the Religious Freedom \\nRestoration Act of 1993 (\\u201cRFRA\\u201d), which requires as an initial \\nmatter finding a substantial government burden on the exercise of religion; if such a burden exists, the Court must determine \\nwhether there is a compelling governmental interest and that \\nthe burden is the least restrictive means of furthering that \\ninterest. Hobby Lobby , 573 U.S., at 694-95. \\n 22\\ncommunity.\\u201d Id., at 736\\u201337 (Kennedy, J., \\nconcurring). \\nIn another instance, this Court found Missouri \\nviolated a church\\u2019s religious  liberty guarantees under \\nthe First Amendment when it categorically denied \\ntheir participation in a grant program for playground \\nsurface materials. Trinity Lutheran Church of \\nColumbia, Inc. v. Comer , 137 S. Ct. 2012, 2017, 2025 \\n(2017). Finding that otherwise eligible grant \\nrecipients were disqualified solely because of their \\nreligious nature, this Court held that such a penalty \\nworked against the free exercise of religion and \\u201ctriggers the most exacting scrutiny.\\u201d Id., at 2021. \\nImportantly, the harm was not the denial of the grant itself but instead was Missouri\\u2019s refusal to \\neven allow the church to compete with secular \\norganizations for grant funds solely on the basis of \\nits religious identity. Id., at 2022. \\nMore recently still, this Court took up the mantle \\nof religious liberties in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia . \\nDespite the Catholic Church\\u2019s over two centuries of dedication to serving the needy children of \\nPhiladelphia, the City in 2018 stopped referring foster children to the Catholic Social Services (\\u201cCSS\\u201d) \\nafter learning the organization would not \\u201cconsider \\nprospective foster parents in same-sex marriages.\\u201d \\nFulton , 141 S. Ct., at 1874\\u201375. Finding that \\u201cit is \\nplain\\u201d the City burdens CSS\\u2019s \\u201creligious exercise by putting it to the choice of  curtailing its mission or \\napproving relationships inconsistent with its beliefs,\\u201d this Court sought a review of whether such burden \\nwas \\u201cconstitutionally permissible.\\u201d Id., at 1876. In \\ndetermining that Philadelphia imposed an unconstitutional burden on CSS\\u2019s religious exercise, \\n 23\\nFulton  admonishes that \\u201cso lo ng as the government \\ncan achieve its interests in a manner that does not \\nburden religion, it must do so.\\u201d Id., at 1881. \\nTaken together, the precedents of this Court \\nestablish that an exacting analysis is required in \\nreligious liberty cases to determine whether the \\ngovernment\\u2019s interest is compelling, and its burden \\nnarrowly tailored to achieve that interest. The \\nexistence of an alternative means for achieving even \\na compelling interest is nearly always fatal to the government\\u2019s argument.  \\n2. When religious liberty and free expression \\nconcerns intertwine, this Court has been even less \\nhesitant to invalidate an infringing law. This \\nskepticism is warranted, as attempts to compel \\nexpression that conflicts with an individual\\u2019s \\nreligious beliefs are nothing more than indirect \\nattempts to regulate religion itself. \\nIn 1943, this Court took issue with a West \\nVirginia law mandating a flag salute and pledge, when its application was challenged by a group of \\nJehovah\\u2019s Witnesses who said such action violated \\ntheir religious beliefs. W. Va. State Bd. Of Educ. V. \\nBarnette , 319 U.S. 624 (1943). Refusing to find that \\n\\u201ca Bill of Rights which guards the individual\\u2019s right \\nto speak his own mind, left it open to public \\nauthorities to compel him to utter what is not on his \\nmind,\\u201d the Barnette  Court blocked the law\\u2019s \\nenforcement. Id. , at 634; see also  id., at 645 (Murphy, \\nJ., concurring) (recognizing \\u201c[t]he right of freedom of thought and of religion as guaranteed by the \\nConstitution against State action includes both the \\nright to speak freely and the right to refrain from \\n 24\\nspeaking at all\\u201d). Underlying the Court\\u2019s opinion was \\nthe belief that \\u201c[i]f there is any fixed star in our \\nconstitutional constellation, it is that no official, high \\nor petty, can prescribe what  shall be orthodox in \\npolitics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act \\ntheir faith therein.\\u201d Id., at 642. \\nExpanding on the holding in Barnette , the Court \\nin Wooley v. Maynard  considered a religious \\nobjection to display of the New Hampshire state motto\\u2014\\u201cLive Free or Die\\u201d\\u2014on the license plate of a \\ncar owned by Jehovah\\u2019s Witness. 430 U.S. 705 (1977). In Wooley , the Court expressly rejected the \\nidea that \\u201cthe State may constitutionally require an individual to participate in the dissemination of an \\nideological message by displaying it on his private \\nproperty.\\u201d Id., at 713. \\nFoundational to its decision was the Court\\u2019s \\nholding that the freedoms contained within the First \\nAmendment \\u201cincludes both the right to speak freely \\nand the right to refrain from speaking at all.\\u201d Id., at \\n714. It matters not whether most agree with the message the State seeks to force a person to convey; the First Amendment unquestionably \\u201cprotects the \\nright of individuals to hold a point of view different \\nfrom the majority and to refu se to foster . . . an idea \\nthey find morally objectionable.\\u201d Id. , at 715. Finding \\nthe existence of a governmental burden, the Court \\nwas left to question whether a substantial \\ngovernmental interest existed and, if so, whether the \\nburden was narrowly tailored to advance that \\ninterest. Even assuming a legitimate and substantial interest, the Court concluded \\u201cthat purpose cannot \\nbe pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental \\n 25\\npersonal liberties when the end can be more \\nnarrowly achieved.\\u201d Id., at 716. New Hampshire \\nfailed that test. \\nIn still another line of cases, this Court found \\nthat it violated Constitutional protections to subject religious observants, who went door to door \\ndistributing religious materials and soliciting for the \\npurchase of religious books, to a government \\nsolicitation registration requirement. Murdock v. \\nPennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105 (1943); see also Follett v. \\nTown of McCormick , 321 U.S. 573 (1944). \\nAcknowledging that the practice was derived from the believer\\u2019s understanding that he was \\u201cobeying a \\ncommandment of God,\\u201d the Court found that the First Amendment prohibited the imposition of a \\ngenerally applicable registration requirement to \\nengage in such conduct. Murdock , 319 U.S., at 108, \\n117. Indeed, the Court went out of its way to describe the literature being distributed as \\u201cprovocative, \\nabusive, and ill-mannered.\\u201d Id., at 115\\u201316. \\nNevertheless, \\u201c[p]lainly  a community may not \\nsuppress . . . the dissemination of views because they \\nare unpopular, annoying or distasteful.\\u201d Id.,  at 116 \\nTo allow otherwise would \\u201cbe a complete repudiation of the philosophy of the Bill of Rights.\\u201d Id. \\nThe Court went further still , establishing that the \\nmere fact the religious materials were being \\u201csold\\u201d was not enough to transform \\u201cevangelism into a \\ncommercial enterprise.\\u201d Id., at 111. As such, the \\nCourt acknowledged heightened constitutional protections for \\u201cthose spreading their religious \\nbeliefs through the spoken and printed word.\\u201d Id. As \\ncompared to purely commercial activity, \\u201c[f]reedom of \\n 26\\npress, freedom of speech, fr eedom of religion are in a \\npreferred position.\\u201d Id., at 115. \\nEven Employment Division v. Smith , often \\ncriticized as having watered down constitutional \\nreligious liberty protections, recognized the Court\\u2019s \\nunique hostility toward burdens that implicate both \\nthe free exercise of religion and the freedom of \\nspeech. The \\u201cFirst Amendment bars application of a \\nneutral, generally applicable law to religiously \\nmotivated action\\u201d when that action \\u201cinvolve[s] not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but the Free \\nExercise Clause in conjunction with other \\nconstitutional protections, such as freedom of \\nspeech.\\u201d Empl. Div. v. Smith , 494 U.S. 872, 881\\u201382 \\n(1990). Even some preceden ts, decided on free speech \\ngrounds alone, were undoubtedly reinforced by \\ntouches of freedom-of-religion concerns. Id. \\n3. This much is clear: the arc of this Court\\u2019s \\nprecedent bends in one incontrovertible direction. \\nScrutiny of any government burden is at its zenith \\nwhen the burden effects an individual\\u2019s exercise of their religious beliefs in a manner that implicates \\nfree speech protections. This conclusion, rooted in the \\nhistory and tradition of religious exercise as \\nunderstood by the Founders and enshrined in the \\nFirst Amendment, demands that any such burden be \\nsubjected to the most rigorous application of strict \\nscrutiny analysis. \\nIt is precisely for this reason that, to the best of \\nAmicus Curiae\\u2019s knowledge, the Court has never \\nissued an opinion finding that governmentally \\ncompelled religious speech satisfies strict scrutiny. \\nSee 303 Creative Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Elenis , 6 F.4th \\n 27\\n1160, 1191 (U.S. 10th Cir. 2021) (Tymkovich, C.J., \\ndissenting) (\\u201c[T]he majority takes the remarkable\\u2014\\nand novel\\u2014stance that the government may force \\nMs. Smith to produce messages that violate her \\nconscience. . . . No case has ever gone so far.\\u201d). \\nThis case should not be the first. \\nIII. THE TENTH CIRCUIT \\u2019S OPINION CANNOT BE \\nSQUARED EITHER WITH THE FIRST \\nAMENDMENT \\u2019S RICH HISTORY OR THIS COURT \\u2019S \\nPROTECTION OF BELIEVERS \\u2019 FREE SPEECH \\nRIGHTS . \\nIn its permissive application of strict scrutiny, the \\nTenth Circuit bastardized this Court\\u2019s protection of free speech rights, especially as applied to religious \\nexpression. If allowed to stand, its precedent will give license to courts across this Country to \\nhumiliate members of all religious sects by \\ncompelling them to speak in contravention of their \\nsincerely held religious beliefs. By purporting to \\napply strict scrutiny, the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s opinion \\ncheapened the First Amendment rights of Catholics, \\nProtestants, Muslims, Jews, and all other believers alike. \\nLuckily, this precedent d oes not need to stand. \\nThis Court, once again, has an opportunity to \\nadmonish that the free speech protections of \\nbelievers are no less than non-believers and, in fact, \\nare heightened when faced with government \\nregulation that would compel speech antithetical to the tenants of a believer\\u2019s faith. The First \\nAmendment commands such a result. \\n 28\\nAlthough the Tenth Circuit rightly concluded that \\nMs. Smith\\u2019s website designs are \\u201cpure speech,\\u201d 303 \\nCreative LLC, 6 F.4th, at 1176, the Tenth Circuit \\nwrongly concludes that the commercial nature of Ms. \\nSmith\\u2019s speech gives Colorado a regulatory hook to \\nlatch onto. Id., at 1179. By failing to acknowledge the \\nreligious nature of her objection to the would-be compelled speech, the Tenth Circuit did not afford \\nher First Amendment rights the \\u201cpreferred\\u201d status \\nthey deserve.\\n5 Cf., Murdock , 319 U.S., at 115. What \\nis remarkable is that the religious nature of Ms. Smith\\u2019s objection is not disputed. See 303 \\nCreative, 6 F. 4th, at 1172 (Ms. Smith is \\u201cwilling to create custom graphics and websites for gay, lesbian, \\nor bisexual clients . . . so long as the custom graphics \\nand websites do not violate [her] religious beliefs, as is true for all customers.\\u201d (internal quotation marks \\nomitted)); id., at 1192 (Tymkovich, C.J., dissenting) \\n(\\u201cIn short, Colorado appear s to agree that Ms. Smith \\ndoes not distinguish between customers based on \\nprotected-class status and thus advances the aims of \\nCADA. But when any customer asks Ms. Smith to \\ncreate expressive content that violates her sincerely \\nheld beliefs, she will decline the request.\\u201d). \\n                                           \\n5 Remarkably, the Tenth Circuit  suggests that its sweeping \\nholding may not apply to \\u201call artists\\u201d if they were not engaged \\nin \\u201ccommercial activity,\\u201d but rather \\u201ccommissioning a mural for some charitable purpose.\\u201d 303 Creative , 6 F.4th, at 1182, n.6. To \\nsuggest that a local artist wh o refuses to paint a Christian \\nmural for a church may enjoy more constitutional protections \\nthan a woman called to live out her sincerely held religious \\nbeliefs by creating custom wedding websites is, thankfully, not supported by the history or tradition of the First Amendment \\nand the muscular protections it affords religious believers. \\n 29\\nThis failure is compounded by the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s \\nfallacy of a marketplace of one for Ms. Smith\\u2019s \\nspeech. Id. at 1180. Such convenient analysis \\nallowed the court to conclude \\u201cthere are no less intrusive means of providing equal access to those  \\ntypes of services.\\u201d Id. (emphasis added). But this \\nclever reasoning flips this Court\\u2019s precedent on its \\nhead. Rather than prioritize the religious speaker\\u2019s \\nobjection in search of a less restrictive means, the \\ncourt below merely concluded that she is the only one and therefore no other means will suffice. But, \\nwhere, as here, the government can achieve its interests without burdening religion, the \\nConstitution requires it to do so. Fulton , 141 S. Ct., \\nat 1881. The analysis is also anomalous in the free speech context because it cannot be that the more \\nunique and distinctive the speech, the less  First \\nAmendment protection it deserves. But that is the staggering breadth of the Tenth Circuit majority\\u2019s \\nconclusion. See 303 Creative , 6 F.4th, at 1204-05 \\n(Tymkovich, C.J., dissenting).  \\nMoreover, by categorizing Ms. Smith as nothing \\nmore than a \\u201cpublic accommodation,\\u201d the Tenth \\nCircuit minimized her right to participate in the \\nmarketplace, even as a woman of faith. See 303 \\nCreative, 6 F.4th, at 1181 (\\u201c[W]hether an exception limits market access depends upon the uniqueness of \\nthe public accommodation\\u2019s goods and services\\u2014not \\nthe sincerity of the public accommodation\\u2019s beliefs.\\u201d). \\nTo deny a benefit to those \\u201cwho engage in certain \\nforms of speech is in effect to penalize them for such \\nspeech,\\u201d and constitutionally, no different than \\nconditioning a benefit on a person\\u2019s \\u201cwillingness to \\nviolate a cardinal principle of her religious faith;\\u201d the \\n 30\\nresult is the same: to \\u201cdeter[] or discourage[] the \\nexercise of First Amendment rights of expression.\\u201d \\nSherbert , 374 U.S., at 405-06 (citing Speiser v. \\nRandall, 357 U.S. 513, 518 (1958)). Here too, Colorado seeks to impose the same constitutional \\nharm: speak in violation of your core religious faith \\nor lose the benefit of marketplace participation. Put \\nsimply, Colorado seeks to punish Ms. Smith for her \\nsincerely held religious beliefs. See also Trinity \\nLutheran Church , 137 S. Ct., at 2021\\u201322 (finding a \\nconstitutional violation where a burden puts \\nreligious believers \\u201cto a choice: [] participate in an \\notherwise available benefit\\u201d or maintain your \\nreligious identity). \\nThe same fundamental principle must apply to \\nfree speech and religious practices when they act in concert: \\u201cIn an open, pluralistic, self-governing \\nsociety, the expression of an idea cannot be \\nsuppressed simply because some find it offensive, \\ninsulting, or even wounding.\\u201d Fulton , 141 S. Ct., at \\n1924-25 (Alito, J., concurring). To lose this principle is to lose the \\u201cpreservation of religious freedom.\\u201d Id., \\nat 1925. That is because \\u201c[s]uppressing speech\\u2014or \\nreligious practice\\u2014simply because it expresses an idea that some find hurtful is a zero-sum game.\\u201d Id. \\nThis Court\\u2019s jurisprudence confirms this link \\nbetween religious exercise and free speech because \\nthis Court\\u2019s opinions \\u201cmake it perfectly clear that \\ndiscrimination against religious, as opposed to \\nsecular, expression is viewpoint discrimination.\\u201d \\nNurre v. Whitehead , 559 U.S. 1025, 1028 (2010) \\n(Alito, J., dissenting). And because viewpoint discrimination is \\u201can egregious form of content \\ndiscrimination,\\u201d Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of \\n 31\\nthe Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995), it brings \\nwith it heightened constitutional skepticism. \\nAlthough some may find Ms. Smith\\u2019s religious \\nbeliefs objectionable, \\u201creligions, and those who \\nadhere to religious doctrines, may continue to \\nadvocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by \\ndivine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be \\ncondoned.\\u201d Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U.S. 644, 679 \\n(2015). \\u201cAn open society can keep that promise while still respecting the \\u2018dignity,\\u2019 \\u2018worth,\\u2019 and fundamental equality of all members of the \\ncommunity.\\u201d Fulton , 141 S. Ct., at 1925 (Alito, J., \\nconcurring) (quoting Masterpiece Cakeshop , 138 S. \\nCt., at 1727). Ms. Smith should be free to practice all \\naspects of her faith, without fear of government-\\ncompelled expression against her sincerely held \\nreligious beliefs. The Constitution demands no less. \\nCONCLUSION \\n \\n\\u201c[T]here is before us the right of freedom to \\nbelieve, freedom to worship one\\u2019s Maker according to the dictates of one\\u2019s conscience, a right which the \\nConstitution specifically shelters.\\u201d Barnette , 319 \\nU.S., at 645 (Murphy, J., concurring). For this Court, there is \\u201cno loftier duty or responsibility than to \\nuphold that spiritual freedom to its farthest \\nreaches.\\u201d Id. \\nTo exclude Ms. Smith from offering her services\\u2014\\nsolely on the basis of her religious identity\\u2014would be \\n\\u201codious to our Constitution.\\u201d Trinity Lutheran \\nChurch , 137 S.

As part of that project, EPA has obtained emails and handwritten and typewritten notes under public records requests, which records on their face confess to the driving factor behind this liti-gation and similar litigation and inform the inquiry into federal versus state jurisdiction in this booming class of \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation filed in state courts. These records EPA obtained prompted it to file its first amicus  brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for \\nthe First Circuit, where removal of another among the growing number of \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d lawsuits filed \\nby governmental entities seeking billions of dollars \\nfrom private parties is pending.\\n2 That brief revealed \\ntwo sets of notes each purporting, independently, to record the assertion by an official with the governmen-tal plaintiff in that case, the State of Rhode Island, that the litigation seeks to obtain a \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d to underwrite that State\\u2019s spending ambitions, \\n \\n 1 Pursuant to Rule 37.6, counsel for Amicus  certifies that no \\ncounsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in part and that no person or entity other than Amici  or their counsel made a \\nmonetary contribution intended to fund the brief \\u2019s preparation or submission.

Leave for EPA to file as amicus \\ncuriae  granted on March 26, 2020 \\n2 \\n after the State\\u2019s legislature declined to provide the de-\\nsired funds. Rhode Island\\u2019s confession was made at a meeting attended by \\u201ccabinet\\u201d-level representatives of numerous state governments from across the nation, including a representative from Maryland, and empha-sized the desire to pr oceed in state courts.\\n3 In that First \\nCircuit litigation, numerous  parties rely upon the \\nFourth Circuit\\u2019s decision in  the instant matter, and par-\\nties to the First Circuit litigation ad dressed the Fourth \\nCircuit\\u2019s opinion below in let ters of supplemental au-\\nthority pursuant to Fed. R. Ap p. Pro. 28(j). Because EPA \\nhas obtained records confe ssing the rationale behind \\nthe veritable tsunami of state-court \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d lawsuits such as the one now before this Court, and af-firming the plaintiffs\\u2019 emp hasis among peers and other \\npotential governmental plaint iff-recruits on using state \\ncourts for these actions with  national p olicy implica-\\ntions and avoiding the federal court system, EPA is keenly interested in this case and asks this Court to \\ngrant certiorari to address th e proper relationship be-\\ntween the state and federal court systems. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\n As important as climate policy is to both state and \\nfederal governments, equally and arguably more im-portant is the principle that the courts\\u2019 role is not to \\nmake policy judgments. This Court held in American \\nElectric Power v. Connecticut , 131 S. Ct. 2527, 2539, \\n \\n 3 A full list of attendees prepared by the organizers and ob-\\ntained under Colorado law is ava ilable at https://govoversight.org/ \\nwp-content/uploads/2020/01/Fulsome-list-of-participants.png. \\n3 \\n 564 U.S. 410, 426 (2011) that \\u201cthe federal courts would \\nhave no warrant to employ the federal common law of nuisance to upset\\u201d federal primacy in climate regula-tory policy. But rather than heed the American Electric \\nPower  opinion\\u2019s warnings that federal policy decisions \\nare to be made by Congress or by federal agencies ex-ercising properly delegated authority, certain litigants have instead attempted to end run that holding by seeking to create policy in state, rather than federal, courts. While federal courts ar e courts of limited juris-\\ndiction, in this matter the de cision below is based upon \\na series of cases that have eviscerated the jurisdiction of federal courts, even when important federal inter-ests are at stake. This is in conflict with the decisions of other Circuits, congressional action taken since these \\nFourth Circuit precedents were  adopted, and this Court\\u2019s \\nown rulings. Allowing the opin ion below to stand will \\ncause mischief in state courts across the nation. Re-cently obtained public records provide strong impetus to acknowledge, as a formal matter, that this \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation campaign is an impermissible use of the state courts, just as this Court previously held it \\nwas an impermissible use of the federal courts. This Court should prevent litigants from seeking the most favorable forum to obtain p olitical and policy ends by \\njudicial means. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\n  \\n4 \\n ARGUMENT \\nI. THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\\u2019S DECISION CON-\\nTRADICTS RECENT JURISPRUDENCE \\nAND LEGISLATION. THIS COURT SHOULD \\nGRANT CERTIORARI TO ENFORCE ITS OWN PRECEDENTS AND CONGRESSIONAL INTENT \\n The decision below, designated for publication and \\nwith the potential to shape or confuse the law for years \\nto come, is based on a series of precedents unique to the Fourth Circuit, many of which contradict more re-\\ncent holdings of this Court and even statutory changes \\nenacted by Congress. The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s reliance on its own, idiosyncratic precedents led to a result that is \\nin conflict with the holdings  of numerous other courts \\nand which will, if allowed to stand, result in mischief across the nation. \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision below, while pub-\\nlished only this year, has its foundations in a holding \\nfrom the 1970s that has been  adrift in changing legal \\nseas since then, and was implicitly swamped by a hold-ing of this Court twenty years ago. That Fourth Circuit \\nopinion, Noel v. McCain , 538 F.2d 633 (4th Cir. 1976), \\nheld that remand orders are essentially unreviewable unless they raise very narrow statutory grounds. Stare \\ndecisis  is an important legal principle, but in this case \\nthe Fourth Circuit\\u2019s adherence to its own precedents rather than those of this Court was misplaced. \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision below acknowledges \\nthat this Court subsequently interpreted the same \\n5 \\n statutory language differently in Yamaha Motor Corp., \\nU.S.A. v. Calhoun , 516 U.S. 199 (1996). More recently, \\nthe Seventh Circuit reached a contrary conclusion \\nabout the reviewability of di strict court orders to re-\\nmand in Lu Junhong v. Boeing Co. , 792 F.3d 805, 810\\u2013\\n13 (7th Cir. 2015). Even assuming, arguendo , that the \\nFourth Circuit properly decided the Noel  case in 1976, \\ncontinued reliance on Noel  is no longer appropriate. \\n It isn\\u2019t just precedent t hat has changed since the \\nFourth Circuit issued its opinion in Noel . Relevant \\nstatutory law has also changed: the Removal Clarifica-\\ntion Act of 2011, Pub. L. No. 112-51, 125 Stat. 545, clar-ified Congressional intent for federal courts to \\u201cclarify \\nand improve certain provisions relating to the removal \\nof litigation against Federal officers or agencies to Fed-\\neral courts.\\u201d \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision below (hereinafter \\n\\u201cBaltimore \\u201d), is based on foundations that Congress, \\nother federal courts, and this Court have steadily \\neroded since the Fourth Circu it issued the authority on \\nwhich Baltimore  rests. This Court, the Seventh Circuit, \\nand Congress itself have all spoken more recently. The \\ninnovative legal theories brought by the Plaintiffs in this case further highlight the need to decide the mat-\\nter based on current law. This Court should take the \\nopportunity to apply the Removal Clarification Act and resolve the split in the circuits that the Baltimore  opin-\\nion below aggravates. \\n \\n6 \\n II. IF THE DECISION BELOW STANDS, FED-\\nERAL COURTS WILL BE UNABLE TO PRE-\\nVENT FEDERAL POLICIES FROM BEING UNDERMINED AT THE STATE LEVEL \\n This suit is but one of many similar suits being \\nfiled all over the country. More than a dozen U.S. cit-\\nies, states and counties including the State of Rhode Island, City and County of Boulder (CO), City and \\nCounty of Honolulu (HI), City of New York (NY), \\nMarin, San Mateo and Santa Cruz Counties (CA), the cities of Imperial Beach, Oakland, Richmond, San \\nFrancisco, San Mateo, and Santa Cruz (CA), and King \\nCounty (WA), among others have filed similar claims against similar and generally the same defendants al-\\nleging similar causes of action which allegedly arise \\nunder state law. As at least one court has previously noted, multi-front litigation raises important concerns \\nabout the motivations of litigants. Chevron Corp. v. \\nDonziger , 974 F.Supp.2d 362, 475 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (\\u201cThe \\npoint of the multi-front strategy thus was to leverage \\nthe expense, risks, and bu rden to [defendant] of de-\\nfending itself in multiple jurisdictions to achieve a swift recovery, most likely by precipitating a settle-\\nment.\\u201d), later upheld at Chevron Corp. v. Donziger , 833 \\nF.3d 74 (2d Cir. 2016), cert. denied  at 137 S. Ct. 2268 \\n(2017). \\n This explosion in such cases filed in state court \\nseeks many hundreds of billions of dollars from private \\nparties, and seeks to enlist the defendants as advo-\\ncates in pressing for the plai ntiffs\\u2019 and their partners\\u2019 \\ndesired federal policies. Records obtained by Amicus  \\n7 \\n also show the attempt to us e the litigation to obtain \\ngovernmental revenues after that failed through the \\nappropriate, political process (see, infra ). Affirming the \\nimpropriety of this use of the courts as well as the ar-dent campaign by state and municipal plaintiffs to \\nkeep the matters away from the federal court and ex-\\nclusively before state courts, EPA has obtained emails and handwritten and typewritten notes under public \\nrecords requests, further discussed below, that illus-\\ntrate the danger of allowing st ate courts to interfere in \\nthis way in lawful interstate commerce conducted un-\\nder the auspices of the federal government. Key among \\nthese public records are two sets of notes each purport-ing, independently, to record the assertion by a senior \\nState of Rhode Island official that the objective of its \\nlitigation was to obtain a \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d for the State\\u2019s spending ambitions, in the face of a leg-\\nislature that does not share the executive\\u2019s priorities. \\n Both sets of notes record that official as emphasiz-\\ning the use of state courts to  obtain this funding denied \\nthem by the legislature. Other records, also noted, in-\\nfra, record the plaintiff \\u2019s legal counsel\\u2019s team, at least \\nsome of whom also represent the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore in this litigation,\\n4 lobbying gov-\\nernmental officials to join the campaign emphasizing the strategy of advancing this cause in the \\u201cmore ad-vantageous venue for these cases,\\u201d which plaintiffs confess is to be had in state courts. \\n \\n 4 The California law firm Sher Edling LLP represents both \\nthe State of Rhode Island in the First Circuit and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore in the Fourth Circuit. \\n8 \\n  These public records obtained through state open \\nrecords laws by Amicus  EPA represent a Rhode Island \\n\\u201ccabinet\\u201d-level official confiding to peers that the \\nState\\u2019s elected representatives are insufficiently moved by the plaintiff \\u2019s requests to enact laws raising \\nthe revenues the State\\u2019s executive desires; and that it \\nis thus \\u201clooking for [a] sustainable funding stream,\\u201d having been reduced to \\u201csuing big oil\\u201d for its \\u201cPriority \\n\\u2013 sustainable funding stream .\\u201d Notably, both sets of \\nnotes capture the State of Rhode Island as having em-phasized the \\u201cstate court\\u201d aspect of its plan. \\n These records, representing a similarly-situated \\nplaintiff \\u2019s confession, as recorded identically by two by \\nothers in the comfort of a presumably candid and off-\\nthe-record private meeting with peers and funders of \\u201cclimate\\u201d activism, leave little doubt that this growing \\nwave of state court \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation seeks \\nat least two impermissible objectives. First, this type of litigation seeks to use (state) courts to effectively \\ncreate federal energy and environmental policy. Sec-\\nond, in addition to using litigation as a stand-in for \\nthe political process that has denied state and munic-\\nipal plaintiffs their desired policies, it seeks to use lit-\\nigation to raise revenues having be en denied them \\nwhere revenues would properly be raised, which \\nagain is by the po litical process. \\n These public records provide strong impetus to \\nacknowledge, as a formal matter, that this \\u201cclimate \\nnuisance\\u201d litigation campaign is an impermissible use of the courts, seeking the most favorable forum to ob-\\ntain political ends by judicial means; that when filed \\n9 \\n they must remain in federal court; and that they \\nshould be dismissed for the same reasons. \\n \\nIII. PUBLIC RECORDS OBTAINED BY PRO-\\nPOSED AMICUS CURIAE  AFFIRM THIS \\nCASE BELONGS IN FEDERAL COURT \\n Amicus  EPA has obtained public records from Col-\\norado State University\\u2019s Center for a New Energy Economy (\\u201cCNEE\\u201d) under the Colorado Open Records \\nAct (\\u201cCORA\\u201d). Those records have now been brought to \\nthe attention of the First Circuit in related litigation, and are proper subject for judic ial notice by this Court. \\nSee Fed. Rule Evid. 201(b)(2). The records pertain to a \\ntwo-day meeting in July 2019 hosted by the Rockefel-ler Brothers Fund (\\u201cRBF\\u201d) at the Rockefeller family \\nmansion at Pocantico, NY. They include numerous \\nemails, agendas and other materials. Most pertinent, they also include a set of handwritten notes and a sec-\\nond, corroborating set of typewritten notes. According \\nto the public records themselves, the former was pre-pared by attendee Carla Frisch of the Rocky Mountain \\nInstitute (\\u201cRMI\\u201d), and the latter by attendee Katie \\nMcCormack of the Energy Foundation.\\n5 \\n \\n 5 These are available, respectively, at https://climatelitigationwatch. \\norg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Carla-Frisch-handwritten-notes- EPA_CORA1505.pdf and https:// climatelitigationwatch.org/ \\nwp-content/uploads/2020/03/EF-Katie-McCormack-typed-notes-EPA_CORA1542.pdf. These documents are identified in an August \\n20, 2019 email from CNEE\\u2019s Patric k Cummins transmitting them \\nto RBF\\u2019s Michael Northrop, Subject: meeting highlights, available at https://climatelitigationwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ \\n \\n10 \\n  This was a private event, styled \\u201cAccelerating \\nState Action on Climate Change,\\u201d if hosted as a forum \\nfor policy activists and a major funder to coordinate \\nwith senior public employees, e.g., a governor\\u2019s chief of staff and department secretaries and their cabinet \\nequivalents from fifteen states. These states included \\nFirst Circuit Plaintiff the State of Rhode Island, repre-sented by its Director of the Department of Environ-\\nmental Management, Janet Coit.\\n6 \\n These notes purport to contemporaneously record \\nthe comments of Director Coit discussing Rhode Is-\\nland\\u2019s entry in this litigation campaign, among peers. One passage in each set of no tes, attributed to Director \\nCoit and replicated almost verbatim in both, is partic-\\nularly striking and relevant, affirming two points that have become obvious and which should inform key de-\\ncisions confronting the judiciary in this \\u201cclimate nui-\\nsance\\u201d litigation campaign. \\n The records show RMI\\u2019s Frisch recorded Director \\nCoit speaking to this litigation as shown in the below \\n \\nEdited-notes-transmittal-email-CSU-suggests-Snail-mail-probably- \\ncovered-EPA_CORA1481_Redacted.pdf. \\u201cRBF CNEE climate pol-icy notes Jul 17 18.docx\\u201d are Katie McCormack\\u2019s notes (Energy Foundation); these appear to be produced as document EPA_ CORA1542.pdf, derived from Ms. McCormick\\u2019s transmittal email \\nbeing 1541, in which she describes her notes as long, and 1542 consists of 18 pages of notes;  \\u201cXerox Scan_07222019155622.pdf \\u201d \\nare Carla Frisch\\u2019s handwritten notes (this was produced as docu-ment EPA_CORA1505.pdf ). \\n \\n6 The participant list is availabl e at https://climatelitigation-\\nwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/List-of-Attendees-EPA_ CORA1037.pdf. \\n11 \\n excerpted image (Ms. Frisch\\u2019s notes are available in \\nfull at https://climatelitigationwatch.org/wp-content/ \\nuploads/2020/03/Carla-Frisch-handwritten-notes-EPA_ \\nCORA1505.pdf ). Ms. Frisch recorded Director Coit as saying, about this suit: \\nRI \\u2013 Gen Assembly D but doesn\\u2019t care on env/climate \\nlooking for sustainable funding stream \\nsuing big oil for RI damages in state court \\n \\n The first line-item attributes to Director Coit the \\nposition that the Rhode Island legislature is not per-suaded of the claims set fort h by the State in its litiga-\\ntion. This reluctance to politically impose the revenue-\\nraising measures (taxes) necessary for such funding streams is inherently shared among all \\u201cclimate nui-\\nsance\\u201d plaintiffs. The excerp t appears to also reflect \\nDirector Coit\\u2019s view of why the Rhode Island legisla-ture has thereby declined to obtain from the taxpayer, \\n\\n12 \\n and then appropriate to the State, the revenue streams \\nthat governmental Plaintiff Rhode Island desires. \\n This entry on its face represents a senior official \\nconfessing that Rhode Island\\u2019s climate litigation, es-\\nsentially identical to that in the Baltimore case below, \\nis in fact a product of Rhode Island\\u2019s elected represent-atives lacking enthusiasm for politically enacting cer-\\ntain policies, including reve nue measures, thus leaving \\nthe state \\u201clooking for [a] sustainable funding stream,\\u201d and so \\u201csuing big oil.\\u201d This characterizes all such gov-\\nernmental plaintiffs and su its including the matter \\nin the Fourth Circuit case which is the subject of the \\nPetition in this matter. \\n Fortunately, we can be confident that Ms. Frisch \\ndid not mishear Director Coit. The Energy Foundation\\u2019s \\nKatie McCormack provided RBF with a typewritten \\nset of her own notes transcribing the proceedings. To this Court\\u2019s further benefit, Ms. McCormack\\u2019s type-\\nwritten transcription of Director Coit\\u2019s commentary \\nreads almost verbatim as Ms. Frisch\\u2019s. \\n Ms. McCormack recorded Di rector Coit as saying: \\n* Assembly very conservative leadership \\u2013 don\\u2019t \\ncare about env\\u2019t \\n* If care, put it in the budget \\n* Priority \\u2013 sustainable funding stream * State court against oil/gas \\n13 \\n  \\n These notes on their face both affirm two realities \\nthat have become inescapable in recent years about this epidemic of \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation, all chan-neled into state courts (aft er the first generation of \\nsuits floundered in federal co urt, and ultimately were \\nterminated by this Court in American Electric Power v. \\nConnecticut , 131 S. Ct. 2527, 2539, 564 U.S. 410, 426 \\n(2011)).\\n7 That is that these suits seek to use the courts \\nto stand in for policymakers on two fronts. First, these suits ask the courts to substitute their authority for that of the political branches of government on matters of policy. Second, these suits seek billions of dollars in revenues, again the province of the political branches, for distribution toward political uses and constituen-cies. \\n O n  t h a t  fi r s t  c o u n t  o f  policymaking through the \\ncourts, the RBF meeting notes ratify a comment made to The Nation magazine by the plaintiffs\\u2019 tort lawyer credited with inventing this wave of litigation, Matt \\n \\n 7 See, e.g., Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp ., \\n663 F.Supp.2d 863 (N.D. Cal. 2009), upheld at  696 F.3d 849 (9th \\nCir. 2012). \\n\\n14 \\n Pawa. The magazine wrote, \\u201cAt the end of his speech, \\nSenator [Sheldon] Whitehouse [of Rhode Island] re-minded his colleagues of their \\u2018legislative responsibil-ity to address climate change.\\u2019 But it\\u2019s clear that too many lawmakers have abdicated, thus the pressure to tackle the climate issue thro ugh existing regulations \\nlike the Clean Air Act, and through the courts. \\u2018I\\u2019ve been hearing for twelve years or more that legislation is right around the corner that\\u2019s going to solve the global-warming problem, and that litigation is too long, difficult, and arduous a path,\\u2019 said Matthew Pawa, a climate attorney. \\u2018Legislation is going nowhere, so liti-gation could potentially play an important role.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n8 \\n Such use of the courts is of course improper but \\nalso informs a conclusion that these cases, when \\nbrought, belong in federal cour t, as well as that they \\nshould be dismissed for reasons including the inher-\\nently obvious, and now repeatedly confessed, purpose. \\n The second conclusion affirmed by these twice-\\nsourced assertions by the First Circuit plaintiffs is that \\nthis type of litigation is a grab for revenues, which again must properly be purs ued through the political \\nprocess. This is related to the first, in that, like policy, \\nsuch revenue-raising measures must be enacted by the voters\\u2019 elected representatives or approved directly by \\nvoters. Instead, with the desire for more \\u201cfunding \\nstreams\\u201d being yet another way the political process \\n \\n 8 Zoe Carpenter, The Government May Already Have the \\nLaw It Needs to Beat Big Oil , The Nation (July 15, 2015), \\nhttps://www.thenation.com/article/the-government-may-already-have-the-law-it-needs-to-beat-big-oil/. \\n15 \\n has failed such plaintiffs, we see them circumventing \\nthat process through this litigation campaign. \\n That the desire for more governmental revenue, \\nwithout adopting the necessa ry direct taxes for which \\nthere can be a political price to pay, was behind such \\nlitigation was suggested by the U.S. Chamber of Com-merce in a 2019 report enti tled \\u201cMitigating Munici-\\npality Litigation: Scope and Solutions,\\u201d published by \\nthe Chamber\\u2019s Institute fo r Legal Reform. That re-\\nport highlighted: \\n* \\u201cFor instance, local government leaders may \\neye the prospect of significant recoveries as a \\nmeans of making up for budget shortfalls.\\u201d \\n* \\u201cLarge settlements like those produced in the \\ntobacco litigation are alluring to municipali-\\nties facing budget constraints.\\u201d \\n* \\u201cSevere, persistent municipal budget con-\\nstraints have coincided with the rise of munic-ipal litigation agains t opioid manufacturers \\nas local governments are promised large re-\\ncoveries with no risk to municipal budgets by contingency fee trial lawyers.\\u201d \\n* \\u201cConclusion  A convergence of factors is propelling munici-\\npalities to file affirmative lawsuits against corporate entities. \\n There is the \\u2018push\\u2019 factor: municipalities face \\nhistoric budgetary cons traints and a public \\ninundated with news reports on the opioid cri-\\nsis, rising sea levels, and data breaches. And \\n16 \\n there is the \\u2018pull\\u2019 of potential multimillion-\\ndollar settlements and low-cost, contingency \\nfee trial lawyers. As a consequence, munici-\\npalities are pivoting to the courts by the thou-\\nsands.\\u201d9 \\n The National Association of Manufacturers\\u2019 Cen-\\nter for Legal Action has similarly argued that, \\u201cThe \\ntowns and lawyers have said that this litigation is \\nsolely about money. The towns want funding for local projects, and their lawyers are working on a contin-\\ngency fee basis, which means they aren\\u2019t paid if they \\ndon\\u2019t win.\\u201d\\n10 \\n The records EPA has obtained now provide docu-\\nmentary evidence to support these concerns that the courts are being exploited to balance municipal/state \\nbudgets and make policy decisions that legislators \\nhave declined to make. \\n \\n  \\n \\n 9 United States Chamber of Co mmerce, \\u201cMitigating Munici-\\npality Litigation: Scope and Solutions,\\u201d U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, March 2019, h ttps://www.instituteforlegalre-\\nform.com/uploads/sites/1/Mitigating-Municipality-Litigation-2019- Research.pdf, at p. 1, 6, 7 and 18, respectively. \\n \\n10 Manufacturers\\u2019 Accountability Project, \\u201cBeyond the Court-\\nroom: Climate Liability Litigation in the United States,\\u201d p. 2, https://mfgaccountabilityproject.or g/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ \\nMAP-Beyond-the-Courtroom-Chapter-One.pdf \\n17 \\n IV. HISTORIC CONCERNS ABOUT STATE \\nCOURT BIAS ARE AMPLIFIED IN CASES \\nOF THIS TYPE, SUCH THAT FEDERAL \\nCOURTS SHOULD STEP IN TO PROTECT \\nFEDERAL INTERESTS \\n A \\u201chistoric concern about state court bias\\u201d is the \\nunderlying basis allowing for federal officer removal. \\nSavoie v. Huntington Ingalls, Inc. , 817 F.3d 457, 461 \\n(5th Cir. 2016). The Supreme Court also recognizes bias as a concern justifying removal to federal court. \\n\\u201cState-court proceedings may reflect \\u2018local prejudice\\u2019 \\nagainst unpopular federal laws or federal officials.\\u201d Watson v. Philip Morris Cos. , 551 U.S. 142, 150 (2007). \\nBias exists, as these opinions acknowledge, and there \\nis no rational basis for declaring that such bias extends only to parties who are unpopular government offi-\\ncials. Indeed, this Court has  cautioned against \\u201cnarrow, \\ngrudging interpretation\\u201d of federal officer removal. Willingham v. Morgan , 395 U.S. 402, 407 (1969). \\nSimply put, \\u201c[t]he removal statute is an incident of fed-\\neral supremacy.\\u201d Murray v. Murray , 621 F.2d 103, 106 \\n(5th Cir. 1980). \\n States and municipalities are engaged in a cam-\\npaign through the courts to overturn \\u201cunpopular fed-\\neral laws.\\u201d Rather than recognizing the Constitution \\nand federal laws as supreme, governmental \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d plaintiffs are applying \\u201cnarrow, grudging\\u201d \\ninterpretation of the removal statute to seek to over-\\nturn federal law through imposing ostensible tort lia-bility in state courts. \\n18 \\n  It is hard to imagine a more striking case where \\nfear of state court bias could be a concern than is pre-\\nsented in the instant matter and similar cases unfold-\\ning across the nation. Stated otherwise and even more affirmatively, the hope  for state court bias is demon-\\nstrably at play in these case s, as shown in other records \\nobtained by Amicus  EPA through public records laws. \\n As documented, supra , by its own admission the \\nState of Rhode Island is pursuing its litigation to ob-tain a \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d for its officials\\u2019 \\nspending ambitions, having failed to convince the vot-\\ners\\u2019 elected representatives to provide one. Rhode Is-land\\u2019s circumstance in this respect differs not at all \\nfrom all such plaintiffs including in Baltimore . Both \\nsets of notes discussed, supra , specify Director Coit\\u2019s \\nemphasis on seeking this \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d \\nin \\u201cstate court.\\u201d All such plaintiffs are now moving \\nHeaven and earth to keep these matters out of the clutches of federal jurisdiction. \\n This objective of suing to make federal policy in \\nstate courts is a thematic cousin of the drive to use the \\ncourts when legislatures fail to enact plaintiffs\\u2019 desired \\npolicies, and is well-understood among the instant plaintiffs, Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, and by \\nthe legal teams for most similarly-situated govern-\\nment plaintiffs. That Rhode Island and the City of Bal-timore share not only claims and legal strategies but \\nlegal counsel, whose recruit ing team has emphasized \\nto targeted governmental entities the desire to keep these matters in state court as the \\u201cmore advantageous \\nvenue for these cases,\\u201d given this Court\\u2019s ruling in \\n19 \\n American Electric Power , raises concerns that the cli-\\nmate nuisance plaintiffs also  share the hope for state \\ncourt biases in the campaign to eliminate budgetary \\nshortfalls and otherwise make policy through tort liti-gation. \\n For example, and again turning to documents ob-\\ntained through open records laws, we see that, after \\nU.S. District Judge William Alsup dismissed the City \\nof Oakland\\u2019s \\u201cclimate nuisanc e\\u201d suit against many of \\nthe same defendants in June 2018,\\n11 a lobbyist hired to \\nassist with recruiting more governmental plaintiffs for \\nSher Edling12 passed along a note of encouragement to \\n \\n 11 City of Oakland, et al. v. BP P.L.C., et al ., N.D. Cal., Order \\nGranting Motion to Dismiss Amen ded Complaints, Alsup, J., June \\n25, 2018, http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/climate-change-litigation/ wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2018/20180625_docket- 317-cv-06011_order-1.pdf. \\n \\n12 The legal/recruiting team is somewhat involved. G. Seth \\nPlatt is one of the network\\u2019s cons ultants, engaged to help lobby \\nFlorida municipalities to file suit similar to the State\\u2019s. At the time of the correspondence cited herein, Platt was a registered lobbyist for the Institute for Gove rnance & Sustainable Development \\n(\\u201cIGSD\\u201d) (www.igsd.org) (see search able index of lobbying regis-\\ntrations at ftlweb01app.azurewebsites.us/Ethicstrac/Lobbyists.aspx). Platt worked with IGSD and others  pitching municipalities to file \\n\\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation against energy interests, with First Circuit and Fourth Circuit plaintiffs\\u2019 counsel Sher Edling. \\n On July 27, 2018 Fort Lauderdale Interim City Attorney \\nAlain Boileau wrote Mayor Dean Trantalis, copying other aides, in pertinent part: \\n\\u201cMayor . . .

Seth Platt flatly stated (or forwarded) the \\nteam\\u2019s position that state courts are the \\u201cmore advan-\\ntageous venue for these cases.\\u201d14 \\n Mr. Platt then quotes UCLA Law professor and \\nalso consultant to plaintiff \\u2019s counsel Sher Edling,15 \\nAnn Carlson, linking in his email to an article quoting \\nProf. Carlson further on this belief that, for whatever \\nreasons, plaintiffs\\u2019 chances for recovery are much bet-\\nter in state fora.16 And in February a Los Angeles Times  \\n \\n 14 https://climatelitigationwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/ \\n03/GSPlatt-explains-seeks-to-encourage-Fort-Lauderdale-post-Judge-Alsop-Opinion.pdf. While recruiting Fort Lauderdale to file a climate nuisance action similar to the instant matter, Platt of-\\nfered \\u201ccontext for Dean and Alain\\u2019s consideration\\u201d in an email to Mayor Dean Trantalis, City Atto rney Boileau, and Mayor\\u2019s Chief \\nof Staff Scott Wyman. This was specifically in response to U.S. District Judge Alsup\\u2019s June 2018 opinion dismissing certain mu-\\nnicipalities\\u2019 \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation on the grounds that the courts were not the proper place to deal with such global issues.  \\n In another email, City Attorney Alan Boileau writes to \\nMayor Trantalis, \\u201cThe governmental plaintiffs are essentially pursuing liability through common law claims at a local level for a global (and not exclusively do mestic) problem upon which the \\njudiciary is taking the position that the issue has been and should be relegated to the exec utive and legislative branches. \\nhttps://climatelitigationwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ CLK_789_2018-Em ails-2nd-FTL-Production.pdf. \\n \\n15 Matt Dempsey, \\u201cUCLA Professor\\u2019 s Role In Climate Litiga-\\ntion Raises Transparency Questions,\\u201d Western Wire, November 27, 2018, https://westernwire.net/u cla-professors-role-in-climate-\\nlitigation-raises-transparency-questions/. \\n \\n16 \\u201c \\u2018[U.S. District Judge William Alsup\\u2019s] decision is irrele-\\nvant from a legal perspective,\\u2019 Carlson said, as long as these cases stay in state courts.

(\\u201cLDF\\u201d) has strived to secure \\nthe constitutional promise of equality for all people. Petitioner asks the Court to reconsider an important question about the Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s reach, which, more than any other constitutional provision, \\nembodies our Nation\\u2019s commitment to equal justice \\nunder the law.  \\nLDF has been at the forefront of efforts to enforce \\nthe Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s promise of equality. See, e.g. , Cooper v. Aaron , 358 U.S. 1 (1958);\\n Brown v. \\nBd. of Educ. of Topeka , 347 U.S. 483 (1954) . LDF has \\nalso led the fight of eradicating discrimination from jury verdicts. See, e.g. , Ham v. South Carolina , 409 \\nU.S. 524 (1973)\\n; Alexander v. Louisiana , 405 U.S. 625 \\n(1972) ; Swain v. Alabama , 380 U.S. 202 (1965). \\nLDF submits this brief to aid the Court in \\ndeciding whether the Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s Due Process Clause incorporates the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement against the States.\\n1  \\n  \\n                                                \\n1 Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.6, counsel for amicus \\ncuriae state that no counsel for a party authored this brief in \\nwhole or in part and that no person other than amicus curiae , its \\nmembers, or its counsel made a monetary contribution to the preparation or submission of this brief. All parties have consented to the filing of this brief. \\n2 \\n \\n SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \\nAfter the Civil War, Congress passed the \\nFourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of \\n1875 to protect the rights of newly freed African \\nAmericans. One of the rights protected by those provisions was the right to  serve on a jury. Indeed, \\nthis Court affirmed the centrality of jury service to the citizenship of African Americans 140 years ago. See \\nStrauder v. West Virginia , 100 U.S. 303 (1879). \\nThen, in 1898, white Louisianans convened a \\nconstitutional convention. Their goal was to craft a constitution that would \\u201cestablish the supremacy of \\nthe white race . . . to the extent to which it could be \\nlegally and constitutionally done . . . .\\u201d Louisiana \\nratified its non-unanimous jury provision at this convention to help achieve its goal of cementing white supremacy. While federal law made it illegal to exclude Black people from jury service, the delegates \\npassed the non-unanimous jury provision to nullify \\nthe votes of Black jurors and allow white jurors to more easily convict Black defendants. \\nLouisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury provision \\nworked exactly as intended. Up until 2018, when \\nLouisianans voted to remove the non-unanimous jury \\nprovision from their constitution, Black defendants were more likely to be convicted by non-unanimous juries than white defendants, and Black jurors were more likely than white jurors to be in the dissent. \\nThus, despite jury service being a hallmark of \\nAmerican citizenship, for ov er a century, Louisiana\\u2019s \\n3 \\n \\n non-unanimous jury provision effectively undermined \\nBlack participation on juries. \\nLouisiana has been permitted to thwart the \\nintent of the Reconstruction Congress in this manner because of this Court\\u2019s decision in Apodaca v. Oregon , \\n406 U.S. 404 (1972), in which Justice Powell\\u2019s idiosyncratic view that the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement does not apply to the States \\nwas the controlling opinion. Th is is the rare case in \\nwhich stare decisis should not control, and this Court \\nshould hold that the Sixth Amendment requires state juries\\u2014like federal juries\\u2014to be unanimous. \\nARGUMENT \\nI. THE HISTORY OF THE FOURTEENTH \\nAMENDMENT COMPELS THE INCORPORATION OF THE SIXTH AMENDMENT UNANIMOUS JURY TRIAL \\nRIGHT.  \\nThis Court recently reiterated that \\u201c[a] Bill of \\nRights protection is inco rporated . . . if it is \\n\\u2018fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty,\\u2019 or \\n\\u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\\u2019s history and tradition.\\u2019\\u201d  \\nTimbs v. Indiana , 139 S. Ct. 682, 687 (2019) (quoting \\nMcDonald v. Chicago , 561 U.S. 742, 767 (2010)). \\nAccordingly, when determining whether a provision of the Bill of Rights is \\u201cfundamental\\u201d or \\u201cdeeply rooted,\\u201d the Court reckons with the historical context \\nof the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e.g. , McDonald , \\n561 U.S. at 770-78 (explicating the position of \\u201cthe \\n4 \\n \\n Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth \\nAmendment\\u201d); id. at 776 (relying on \\u201c[e]vidence from \\nthe period immediately following the ratification of \\nthe Fourteenth Amendment\\u201d); Timbs , 139 S. Ct. at \\n688 (same). An examination of this history compels the incorporation of the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement. \\nIn the aftermath of the Civil War, Southern \\nwhites were neither prepared nor willing to accept the \\n\\u201cfundamentally altered . . . racial status quo in the \\nSouth.\\u201d\\n2 The Thirteenth Amendment\\u2019s ratification \\nabolished slavery in 1865.3 Nevertheless, recalcitrant \\nSouthern states persisted in \\u201csubjugat[ing] newly \\nfreed slaves and maintain[ing] the prewar racial \\nhierarchy.\\u201d Timbs , 139 S. Ct. at 688. Between  1865 \\nand 1866, Southern legislatures accomplished this by passing discriminatory statutes, known as Black \\nCodes, which \\u201creduce[d] blacks to a status somewhere \\nbetween that of slaves (which they no longer were) \\nand full free people (which most white southerners opposed).\\u201d\\n4 And Black Codes governed a wide range of \\naspects of everyday life, including the extent of African American access to the courtroom.\\n5 For \\n                                                \\n2 Paul Finkelman, John Bingham and the Background to the \\nFourteenth Amendment , 36 Akron L.

In December 1865, Congress created \\nthe Joint Committee on Reconstruction, and \\nauthorized the Committee \\u201cto investigate conditions \\nin the South.\\u201d10  \\nThis investigation showed that with respect to \\nformerly enslaved Black people, \\u201cit was impossible to abandon them, without securing them their rights as \\n                                                \\n(2004).

As this Court said in Duncan v. Louisiana , \\u201c[t]he \\nguarantees of jury trial . . . reflect a profound \\njudgment about the way in which law should be enforced and justice administered.\\u201d 391 U.S. 145, 155 (1968).

See \\nApodaca v. Oregon , 406 U.S. 404, 408 n. 3 (1972).\\n29  As \\nstated in 1788 by Chief Justice M\\u2019Kean of the \\nSupreme Court of Pennsylvania when discussing the \\nstate\\u2019s constitutional provision explicitly requiring unanimous juries, \\u201cI have  always understood it to be the law, independent of this section, that the twelve jurors must be unanimous in their verdict, and yet \\nthis section makes this express provision.\\u201d Respublica \\nv.

LOUISIANA\\u2019S NON-UNANIMOUS JURY \\nPROVISION WAS DESIGNED TO NULLIFY \\nBLACK JURY SERVICE.  \\nDespite the foregoing, a majority of this Court in \\nApodaca  held that the Fourteenth Amendment does \\nnot require the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity rule to \\nbe applied in state trials. In reaching that conclusion, \\nthe Court did not grapple with the racist history of \\nLouisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury provision. Thus, the \\n                                                \\n30 Duncan , 391 U.S. at 155. \\n31 Riordan, supra  note 28, at 1424 (quoting Billeci v. U.S. , 184 \\nF.2d 394, 403 (D.C. Cir. 1950)). \\n32Duncan , 391 U.S. at 155. \\n11 \\n \\n Court failed to appreciate the protections unanimity \\nprovides against racial prejudice infecting jury trials. \\nIn Apodaca , the Petitioners argued \\u201cunanimity \\n[was] a necessary precondition for effective application of the cross-section requirement, because a rule permitting less than  unanimous verdicts will \\nmake it possible for convictions to occur without the acquiescence of minority elements within the \\ncommunity.\\u201d Apodaca , 406 U.S. at 412-13.  \\nJustice White\\u2019s opinion re jected this argument \\nbecause it refused to accept its premise. Id. at 413. \\nJustice White could not \\u201cassume that the majority of \\nthe jury will refuse to weigh the evidence and reach a \\ndecision upon rational grounds . . . or that a majority will deprive a man of his liberty on the basis of prejudice when a minority is presenting a reasonable argument in favor of acquittal.\\u201d Id. Justice White \\n\\u201csimply [found] no proof for the notion that a majority \\nwill disregard its instructions and cast its votes for \\nguilt or innocence based on prejudice rather than \\nevidence.\\u201d Id. at 413-14.  \\nIn so reasoning, Justice White\\u2019s opinion does not \\nreckon with the overwhelming evidence that shows \\nLouisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury provision was \\nenacted with discriminatory intent and was designed to facilitate white jurors being able to convict Black defendants over the dissent of Black jurors.  \\nAfter Reconstruction ended and federal troops left \\nthe South, Louisianan Democrats called a \\n12 \\n \\n Constitutional Convention in 1898.33 As two scholars \\nof this period summarized, \\u201cthe sinister purpose of the Convention was to create a racial architecture in \\nLouisiana that could circumvent the Reconstruction \\nAmendments and marginalize the political power of black citizens.\\u201d\\n34 It was at this Convention that \\nLouisiana ratified its non-unanimous jury \\nprovision.35  \\nThe Convention\\u2019s official record is replete with \\nreferences to its racist goals.

The thought of Black defendants being acquitted was untenable to white Louisianans. As one local paper acknowledged, \\u201cin some of the parishes of the State the hostility to \\nthe negro is . . . such . . . that . . . juries in these \\nbenighted localities seem to think that it is their \\nbounden duty to render a verdict of \\u2018guilty as charged,\\u2019 because the accused has black skin.\\u201d\\n49 White \\nLouisianans believed a non-unanimous jury provision \\nwould address this fear by ensuring white jurors\\u2019 \\nability to convict Black defendants over the dissent of Black jurors.\\n50  \\nBy contrast, white Louisianans feared that if \\nBlack men served on juries, Black defendants \\u201cwould \\nsimply not be convicted because of the African-\\nAmerican presence in the jury box.\\u201d51 After the \\nFourteenth Amendment was ratified, one popular newspaper lamented that \\u201cif a negro be on trial for any crime, [a Black juror] becomes at once his earnest \\n                                                \\n47 Id. at 375 (quoting Future of the Freedman , Daily Picayune, \\nAug. 31, 1873, at 5). \\n48 Id. at 376. \\n49 See Frampton, supra note 25 at 1603 (quoting Prejudiced \\nVerdicts , Opelousas Courier, Oct. 26, 1985, at 1). \\n50 See Smith & Sarma, supra note 33 at 375-76.   \\n51 Id. at 375.  \\n16 \\n \\n champion, and a hung jury is the usual result.\\u201d52 A \\nfew years before the 1898 Convention, the same paper \\u201cendorsed the adoption of nonunanimous verdicts\\u201d to \\navoid hung juries.\\n53 The paper claimed such a \\nprovision was needed to avoid \\u201cpopular justice\\u201d\\u2014the mob lynchings that often occurred when Black \\ndefendants were acquitted.\\n54 The article reasoned \\nthat guilty verdicts \\u201cplacat[ed] those intent on \\ncommitting extralegal form s of racial violence.\\u201d55 The \\npaper concluded that a non-unanimous jury provision was needed to ensure that \\u201cone partisan\\u201d (read: Black person) on the jury does not \\u201cdisappoint or obstruct justice.\\u201d\\n56 \\nThe history of Louisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury \\nprovision is important to an incorporation analysis and is the \\u201cproof\\u201d Justice White thought lacking that \\nshows unanimity is required to ensure convictions are \\nnot \\u201cbased on prejudice rather than evidence.\\u201d \\nApodaca , 406 U.S. at 413-14.  \\nIII.

The story of two Black Louisianans who recently served as jurors\\u2014Willie Newton and Bobbie Howard\\u2014compellingly illustrates this point.\\n64 \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard were both born and \\nraised in the small town of Houma, in Terrebonne Parish; the same town where Evangelisto Ramos \\nworked. Mr. Newton, who is 72 years old, runs a \\nfamily business selling burial vaults.

Everything quoted is from their interviews with counsel unless attributed otherwise. \\n19 \\n \\n year-old Mr. Howard has his own accounting practice. \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard both attended segregated schools growing up. In fact, they went to \\nthe same high school, as there was only one in the \\nParish that educated Black children. \\nIn 2014, two years before Mr. Ramos faced trial \\nfor second-degree murder, Mr. Newton and Mr. Howard were selected to serve on the jury for the trial \\nof Matthew Allen, a 20-year-old Black man also \\naccused of second-degree murder. The prosecution\\u2019s \\ntheory was that Mr. Allen intentionally shot and killed the victim; Mr. Allen\\u2019 s defense to the charge \\nwas that he acted in self-defense.\\n65 Mr. Newton and \\nMr. Howard were the only Black jurors. The other ten \\njurors on Mr. Allen\\u2019s jury were white.  \\nMr. Newton vividly recalled  his feelings when he \\nsaw the jury\\u2019s composition: \\u201cBobby and I saw from the beginning that our vote wasn\\u2019t going to matter. We \\nwere outnumbered.\\u201d \\u201cI could have just stayed home.\\u201d \\n\\u201cAin\\u2019t no difference we can make.\\u201d Mr. Newton felt \\ndoubly distraught when he saw that Mr. Allen had a \\u201cbad judge\\u201d who had been reprimanded for wearing blackface.\\n66 Mr. Newton thought to himself, \\u201cBuddy, \\nyou\\u2019re doomed.\\u201d \\n                                                \\n65 See State v. Allen , 2015-0675, 2015 WL 6951570, at *2 (La. Ct. \\nApp. 2015).  \\n66 In 2004, Judge Timothy Ellender was suspended for wearing \\nblackface, handcuffs, and a jail jumpsuit to a Halloween party.  \\nSee Seth Fox, Houma Judge Suspended for Wearing Blackface \\nHalloween Costume , Houma Today (Dec. 13, 2014), \\n20 \\n \\n Reflecting back, Mr. Newton and Mr. Howard \\nthought Mr. Allen\\u2019s race worked against him with the white jurors. \\u201cThey see a Black defendant in a drug \\ndeal and maybe think \\u2018he\\u2019s hustling corner to corner, \\nlet\\u2019s teach him a lesson,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Howard speculated. Mr. Newton echoed this sentiment: \\u201cI think they saw him \\nas a potential threat to the community.\\u201d  \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard looked at Mr. Allen \\ndifferently. They saw a young man who may have \\nmade a mistake, but who still had a life ahead of him. \\nMr. Howard thought these differing perspectives could be due to the fact \\u201ctheir life experiences were different.\\u201d  \\nAfter listening intently to the evidence, both Mr. \\nHoward and Newton favored finding Mr. Allen guilty of manslaughter. \\u201cI thought about his age. I thought he deserved a second chance,\\u201d Mr. Howard said quietly. Mr. Newton confirmed that he \\u201cnever thought \\nit was second-degree murder\\u201d and proposed to his \\nfellow jurors that Mr. Allen should be convicted of \\nmanslaughter, not murder.  \\nDeliberations gave both men hope that at least \\nsome of the white jurors would see the evidence their \\nway and would find Mr. Allen guilty of manslaughter, \\nnot murder. Mr. Howard recalled that one juror, a white woman, seemed to be leaning in favor of manslaughter going into lunch. Mr. Newton remembered there being two or three white jurors \\n                                                \\nhttps://www.houmatoday.com/article/DA/20041213/News/60809\\n9465/HC/.   \\n21 \\n \\n who seemed to think manslaughter was the just \\nconviction. \\nThings took a turn after lunch, however. Mr. \\nHoward recounted that he and Mr. Newton had lunch together, while the white jurors ate together. When they returned from lunch, all ten white jurors wanted to vote for second-degree murder; there was no convincing them otherwise, \\u201ceveryone was set in their \\nways.\\u201d  \\nMr. Newton\\u2019s prediction that his vote wouldn\\u2019t \\nmatter proved prescient. Th e jury convicted Mr. Allen \\nof second-degree murder by a vote of 10-2. All ten \\nwhite jurors voted for guilt. Mr. Newton and Mr. \\nHoward voted not guilty. \\nWhat took place troubled Mr. Howard and Mr. \\nNewton. Mr. Howard recalled: \\u201cI pretty much felt sorry for the young man, to tell you the truth.\\u201d Mr. \\nNewton was more shaken: \\u201cIt hurt me real bad when \\nI looked at that young man, and I looked at his mother and father, and I knew they weren\\u2019t going to see him again, not unless they go up to Angola.\\u201d\\n67 Indeed, Mr. \\nNewton felt the effects of the trial long after it was \\nover: \\u201cWhen I left that jury, it took me a couple of \\nweeks to get myself together. Serving on that jury \\ntook something out of me.\\u201d Mr. Allen, who entered prison for a crime he a when he was only 20, continues to serve a life sentence in Angola Prison.   \\n                                                \\n67 Adelson et al., supra note 57. \\n22 \\n \\n Mr. Newton realized that what happened in Mr. \\nAllen\\u2019s trial probably happened in many others, causing him to wonder, \\u201cHow many others had passed \\nthis way . . . and got the same treatment this boy got.\\u201d \\nThe trial, Mr. Newton explained, made him feel like his \\u201cvoice didn\\u2019t matter,\\u201d \\u201ca second-class citizen.\\u201d  \\nThis experience confirmed for Mr. Newton that \\nLouisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury system was unfair to \\nBlack defendants and Black jurors. In his opinion, the \\nprosecutors \\u201cfound a way to get around the system\\u201d \\nby limiting the number of Black people on Mr. Allen\\u2019s jury to two, knowing they only needed ten votes for a conviction. The trial shook Mr. Newton\\u2019s confidence in \\nthe fairness of Louisiana\\u2019s justice system: \\u201cI know I \\ncouldn\\u2019t sit there and think I\\u2019d get a fair trial.\\u201d  \\nMr. Newton took solace in the fact Louisiana \\nvoters repealed the non-unanimous jury provision last year.\\n68 He expressed that while he does think that \\n\\u201cjustice was served\\u201d during Mr. Allen\\u2019s trial, he felt \\n\\u201cencouraged\\u201d and \\u201cempowered\\u201d to serve on a jury now that his vote was guaranteed to matter. Mr. Howard \\nsaid that he, too, is ready to perform his \\u201ccivic duty\\u201d \\nand serve on a jury under Louisiana\\u2019s new unanimous jury scheme.  \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard\\u2019s experience is a \\nstark example of the indign ities inflicted upon Black \\npeople by Louisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury provision. It is a reminder that, until last year, Louisiana\\u2019s non-\\nunanimous jury system worked the way its racist \\n                                                \\n68 Oregon is now the only state with a non-unanimous jury \\nprovision. \\n23 \\n \\n proponents intended\\u2014to more easily convict Black \\ndefendants and to silence Black jurors. What makes this even worse, is that this system, conceived from \\nracism, has been operating with this Court\\u2019s blessing \\nfor 47 years. Apodaca must be overruled. This Court \\nshould hold that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity \\nrequirement against the States.  \\n \\n  \\n24 \\n \\n CONCLUSION \\nLDF respectfully urges this Court to hold that the \\nFourteenth Amendment incorporates the Sixth \\nAmendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement against the States.  \\nRespectfully submitted,  \\n \\nSherrilyn A.

While debating the extent to \\nwhich the Constitution should enshrine protections for religious freedom during the First Congress, \\nRepresentative Daniel Carroll of Maryland\\u2014one of \\nthe few Catholics among the Constitution's \\nFramers\\u2014remarked \\\"the rights of conscience are, in \\ntheir nature, of peculiar delicacy, and will little bear \\nthe gentlest touch of governmental hand.\\\" 1 Annals \\nof Cong. 757-58 (Joseph Gales ed., 1834) (Aug. 15, 1789). \\nNowhere are the rights of the religious more \\ndelicate than when they intersect with the freedom \\nto put faith into action, belief into words. If the \\nrobust religious freedom protections guaranteed by \\nour Constitution are to have any meaning, they must \\nbe capable of shielding a sincere religious believer from being coerced into speaking against the core \\ntenants of her faith. To hold otherwise would be to \\npermit the heavy hand of government to extinguish \\nreligious practice. This the Constitution will not \\nallow. \\nThe Founders understood that the First \\nAmendment, as drafted, protected all religious sects in their right to speak freely in accordance with their \\nfaith. Indeed, the Founding Generation believed \\nprotections for religious lib erty to be of utmost \\nimport. Since its founding, America has been gripped \\n 3 \\nin debate over religious liberty. Even before the \\ncolonies declared their independence, there were \\nenergetic discussions over the bounds of religious \\ntoleration versus a full freedom to exercise religion \\n(with only limited exceptions). Ultimately, the \\nConstitution's drafters settled on James Madison's \\nview of an unalienable right to practice one's \\nreligious faith. Owed to an understanding that the Governor of the Universe supersedes any earthly \\nauthority, religious convictions were understood to \\ncommand greater deference than mere personal \\nopinions. Where opinion was required to yield to the \\nlaw, tensions between law and religious belief often \\nresulted in exemption for the believer. \\nThe Founding Generation also viewed religious \\nliberty as encompassing more  than mere matters of \\nconscience or decisions on the rightness or wrongness \\nof acts. Instead, the full ex ercise of religion offered a \\nright to act in accordance with one's faith and, \\nnecessarily, included protection from government \\ncompelled speech that violated a believer's firmly \\nheld religious convictions. This distinction was \\nperhaps most clearly expressed in the early colonies' \\nanti-Catholic prejudices. In colonial Georgia, for example, while all worshipers were vested by its \\nCharter with a liberty of conscience, Catholics were \\nexpressly excluded from protections for the more \\nrobust free exercise of religion. McConnell, The \\nOrigins and Historical Understanding of Free \\nExercise of Religion, 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1409, 1489-90 \\n(1989) (hereinafter McConnell, Origins). \\nInformed by the debates and experiences of their \\ntime, the Founders opted to include among the Constitution's protections the more extensive free \\n 4 \\nexercise of religion. In so doing, they extended the \\nmaximum protections available to all who professed \\nbelief in a Universal Sovereign. These protections, it \\nwas understood, included a right to act out belief and \\nto speak, or refrain from speaking, freely, in \\naccordance with faith. \\nWith this understanding as background, it is \\nclear the First Amendment provides dual protections for religious expression (or non-expression) in its \\nguarantees of free speech and free religious exercise. \\nThis reality compels the conclusion that religious \\nspeech enjoys the highest constitutional protection. \\nCertainly, this is consistent with the Founders' \\nunderstanding of robust religious liberty protections, \\nas revealed in the text, history, and tradition of the First Amendment. \\nThis Court's recent religious liberty jurisprudence \\nconcurs with the Founders' view of full-throated \\nreligious liberty protection. Religious observers have \\nwelcomed the relief from government oppression. No \\nlonger can religious believers be excluded solely \\nbecause of their religious identity. Free are the religious to express their religious views without fear \\nof government reprisal. This Court's precedents have \\nbeen unequivocal: if government can achieve its \\nmeans without burdening religion, the Constitution \\nalmost always requires that it must. \\nAnother truism is derived from this Court's \\nprecedents. When religious liberty concerns are coupled with free expression, the Constitution \\ndemands the most exacting scrutiny. That is because \\nthe First Amendment, as understood from the \\nFounding, provides special protection for the \\n 5 \\nreligious, their right to speak freely, and their right \\nto refrain from speaking. Distinct from pure \\ncommercial speech, religious speech demands a \\nhigher constitutional protection. That is why, to \\nAmicus Curiae's knowledge, government compelled \\nreligious speech has never been held to survive strict \\nscrutiny. \\nAgainst this backdrop, the Tenth Circuit's opinion \\ncannot stand. Although purporting to apply strict scrutiny, the Tenth Circuit's analysis is rife with \\nflaws, each one fatal to the court's conclusion. From \\nthe outset, the Tenth Circuit failed to recognize the \\npreferred status of Ms. Smith's free speech rights, \\ngrounded as they are in her religious beliefs. This \\nfailure is only compounded by the Tenth Circuit's lethargic narrow-tailoring analysis. Far from the \\nexacting analysis this Court requires, the Tenth \\nCircuit settles into a now familiar pattern to those of \\nfaith\\u2014ostracizing Ms. Smith from society because of \\nher religious identity. \\nOnce again, this Court must reverse yet another \\nassault on religious freedom by declaring that where, as here, free speech and religion intersect, \\nconstitutional protections are at their greatest. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 6 \\nARGUMENT \\nI. AS ORIGINALLY UNDERSTOOD , THE FIRST \\nAMENDMENT PROTECTED THE RIGHT OF THE \\nRELIGIOUS TO SPEAK AND TO REMAIN SILENT . \\nThe First Amendment is \\\"unique in form among \\namendments to the Constitution.\\\"2 It is drafted, not \\nas a grant of privileges or rights to the people, but as \\na disability on Congress' ability to act. Report to the Attorney General, supra  note 2, at 15\\u201316. In its \\nentirety, the First Amendment reads: \\nCongress shall make no law respecting \\nan establishment of religion, or \\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; or \\nabridging the freedom of speech, or of \\nthe press; or the right of the people \\npeaceably to assemble, and to petition \\nthe Government for a redress of grievances.  \\nU.S.\\n Const., Amdt. 1. \\nIn barring certain kinds of laws, the First \\nAmendment recognizes a pre-existing \\\"immun[ity] from such legislative action.\\\" Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral, supra note 2, at 16. This reflects an \\nunderstanding by the Founding Generation that these \\\"are pre-existent rights\\u2014inalienable rights\\u2014\\n                                           \\n2 O f f i c e  o f  L e g a l  P o l i c y ,  D e p t  o f  J u s t i c e ,  R e p o r t  t o  t h e  \\nAttorney General: Religious Li berty Under the Free Exercise \\nClause at 15 (1986) (hereinafter Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral). \\n 7 \\nand not mere civil privileges conferred by a \\nbenevolent sovereign.\\\" Id. \\nTaken together, the text, history, and philosophy \\nof the First Amendment establish the principle that \\n\\\"the government has no right to interfere with the \\nfree exercise of religion\\\" unless the \\\"government \\naction is necessary to prevent manifest danger to the \\nexistence of the state; to protect public peace, safety, \\nand order; or to secure the religious liberty of \\nothers.\\\" Id., at v. And, even then, only if the \\ngovernment deploys \\\"the least restrictive means \\nnecessary to protect these interests.\\\" Id. This is true \\nas a matter of the First Amendment's Religious Liberty Clauses. And because freedom of religion \\ncannot be divorced from freedom of expression, it is \\neven more true when the government tries to force a \\nbeliever to speak in a way that cannot be reconciled \\nwith her religious convictions. \\nA. Religious liberty was profoundly \\nimportant to the Founding Generation; \\nreligious convictions were understood \\nto receive greater deference than mere \\npersonal opinion. \\n1. The Founding Generation was uniquely \\nattuned to issues regarding the proper relationship \\nbetween religion and government. Indeed, at the time of America's founding there was \\\"an intense and \\ncontroversial theoretical debate\\\" of these issues \\ninvolving \\\"[m]ost of the great political thinkers of the \\nperiod.\\\" McConnell, Origins, at 1430. These thinkers \\ninformed the Founders' own debates on the issue and \\nundoubtedly \\\"influenced the American solution to \\nthe problem.\\\" Id.  \\n 8 \\nJohn Locke, perhaps more than any other \\nphilosopher who contributed to the ideas \\nunderpinning America's founding, provided the \\n\\\"most extensive\\\" discussion of religion and most \\ndirectly influenced the Framers' drafting of the First \\nAmendment. Id. Locke was an early and influential \\ntheoretical thinker and advocate for religious freedom. Id., at 1431. In his view \\\"religious rivalry \\nand intolerance\\\" were \\\"among the most important of political problems,\\\" and \\\"[r]eligious intolerance was inconsistent both with public peace and with good \\ngovernment.\\\" Id. \\nLocke's solution, however, was an \\\"understanding \\nof religious toleration,\\\" that \\\"expressly precludes free \\nexercise exemptions.\\\" Id., at 1435. To Locke, when \\n\\\"individual conscience conflicts with the governmental policy, the government will always \\nprevail and the individual will always be forced to \\nsubmit or suffer the punishment.\\\" Id. Locke's \\ninfluence on the drafters of the First Amendment makes it all the more remarkable that his view did \\nnot triumph with America's founding. \\nThe American Revolution upended the \\npreexisting relationship between religion and government, especially in states where the Anglican \\nChurch had the most influence. Id., at 1436. \\n\\\"America was in the wake of a great religious \\nrevival,\\\" that brought with it a \\\"drive for religious \\nfreedom.\\\" Id., at 1437\\u201338. Along with this drive came \\na push from \\\"religious supporters of disestablishment and free exercise\\\" to enshrine \\n\\\"constitutional protections\\\" for religious freedoms \\\"at the federal level.\\\" Id., at 1440. \\n 9 \\nThis movement was encapsulated in debate \\nsurrounding the religious liberty clause in Virginia's \\n1776 Bill of Rights. When George Mason proposed \\nusing the Lockean phrase \\\"toleration of religion,\\\" \\nJames Madison objected, complaining that the \\nphrase implied an act of legislative grace (which, to \\nLocke, it did). Id. , at 1443. Madison was not alone \\namong the Founding Generation in rejecting this concept. George Washin gton and Thomas Paine \\nsimilarly eschewed \\\"toleration,\\\" decrying its \\nimplication of government \\\"indulgence\\\" rather than a \\nfundamental, preexisting right. Id., at 1443\\u201344. \\nMoreover, Madison objected to Mason's proposal \\nbecause it excepted from even the \\\"toleration\\\" of \\nreligious freedom any instance where \\\"under color of \\nreligion any man disturb the peace, the happiness, or \\nsafety of society.\\\" See G. Hunt, James Madison and \\nReligious Liberty, 1 Ann. Rep. Am. Hist. A. 163, 166 \\n(1901). It was Madison's belief that such phrasing \\n\\\"might easily be so twisted as to oppress religious \\nsects under the excuse that they disturbed 'the \\npeace, the happiness, or safety of society.'\\\" Id. \\nMadison's objections were heard by Virginia's \\nassembly. As adopted, Virginia's Bill of Rights \\npromised that all \\\"are equally entitled to the free \\nexercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience,\\\" and reminded only \\\"that\\n it is the mutual \\nduty of all to practice Christian forbearance, love, and charity towards each other.\\\" Report to the \\nAttorney General, supra  note 2, at 102\\u201303. \\n2. This early debate between Madison and Mason \\nbears witness to what this Court has long noted\\u2014\\nthat Madison was \\\"the leading architect of the \\n 10\\nreligion clauses of the First Amendment.\\\" Hosanna-\\nTabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v. \\nEEOC , 565 U.S. 171, 184 (2012) (internal quotation \\nmarks omitted). Madison's rejection of religious \\ntolerance in favor of full and free religious expression permeates his Memorial and Remonstrance . \\nExplaining that \\\"[t]he Religion then of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every \\nman,\\\" Madison understood that it is not just \\\"the \\nright of every man to exercise it as these may \\ndictate,\\\" but further \\\"the duty of every man to render \\nto the Creator such homage, and such only, as he \\nbelieves to be acceptable to him.\\\" J. Madison, \\nMemorial and Remonstrance \\u00a7 1 (1785), reprinted in \\nEverson v. Bd. of Educ. , 330 U.S. 1, 64 (1947). This \\nright, Madison admonished, \\\"is in its nature an unalienable right.\\\" Id. \\nMadison expounded his view that \\\"[t]his duty is \\nprecedent both in order of time and degree of \\nobligation, to the claims of Civil Society.\\\" Id. Before \\nanyone is \\\"a member of Civil Society,\\\" they are \\\"considered as a subject of the Governor of the \\nUniverse.\\\" Id. For this reason, \\\"in matters of \\nReligion, no man's right is abridged by the institution of Civil Society.\\\" Id. But Madison went \\nfurther. \\\"[I]f religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that \\nof the Legislative Body.\\\" Id., at \\u00a7 2, reprinted in \\nEverson , 330 U.S., at 65. Legislators who \\n\\\"encroach[]\\\" on the rights of the people, Madison \\nsaid, \\\"exceed the commission from which they derive their authority, and are Tyrants.\\\" Id. \\nRecognizing that Madison's Memorial and \\nRemonstrance is not law, see City of Boerne v. Flores , \\n 11\\n521 U.S. 507, 541 (1997) (Scalia, J., concurring), it \\nnonetheless offers a clear understanding of why the \\nFounding Generation thought it so crucial to \\nmemorialize the inalienable freedom of religion in \\nthe First Amendment. And Madison's defense of the \\nAmerican conception of religious liberty merely \\nechoed the prevalent thought at the founding \\\"of the \\ndifference between religious faith and other forms of human judgment.\\\" McConnell, Origins, at 1496. \\nAt the Founding, the prevailing view was that the \\n\\\"opinions of individuals\\\" can not take \\\"precedence \\nover the decisions of civil society.\\\" Id. The same was \\nnot true for religious convictions. \\\"Conflicts arising from religious convictions were conceived not as a \\nclash between the judgment of the individual and of \\nthe state, but as a conflict between earthly and \\nspiritual sovereigns.\\\" Id. In those instances, the \\nperson holding the religious conviction \\\"was not seen as the instigator of the conflict; the believer was simply caught between the inconsistent demands of \\ntwo rightful authorities, through no fault of his own.\\\" \\nId. This view is essential to understanding the \\nFounders' belief that \\\"freedom of religion is unalienable because it is a duty to God and not a \\nprivilege of the individual.\\\" Id., at 1497. \\n3. Bolstering this understanding, the historical \\nrecord surrounding adoption of the Bill of Rights \\nsuggests that the First Amendment's use of the term \\\"religion\\\" was a deliberate choice. See McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1488. Although \\\"[t]he recorded debates \\nin\\\" both chambers of Congress \\\"cast little light on the \\nmeaning of the free exercise clause,\\\" looking at \\nsuccessive drafts of the clause from its consideration \\nand debate in the First Congress are especially \\n 12\\nenlightening. Id., at 1481, 1483. While earlier drafts \\nof the First Amendment used the phrase \\\"rights of \\nconscience,\\\" the final version that emerged enshrined in the First Amendment a protection for the \\\"free \\nexercise of religion.\\\" Id., at 1488. This phrasing lends \\nfurther support to the Founders' understanding of religious freedoms. \\nTo the Founders, \\\"[b]elief in a Supreme Being \\nwas\\\" essential to \\\"religion.\\\" Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral, supra  note 2, at 9. Indeed, \\\"[t]he historical \\nmaterials uniformly equate 'religion' with belief in God or in gods.\\\" McConnell, Origins, at 1493. These references \\\"can be extended without distortion to \\ntranscendent extrapersonal authorities not \\nenvisioned in traditionally theistic terms\\\"\\u2014for \\nexample, Madison's use of \\\"Creator,\\\" \\\"Governor of \\nthe Universe,\\\" and \\\"Universal Sovereign,\\\" imply \\\"an attempt at a definition more compendious than the \\nfamiliar Judeo-Christian God, but it retains the distinction between transcendent authority and \\npersonal judgment.\\\" Id.  \\nReligion, as understood by the Founders and \\nexpressed in the First Amendment, then, is best \\ndefined to encompass \\\"a system of beliefs, whether \\npersonally or institutionally held, prompted by the \\nacceptance of transcendent realities or \\nacknowledging extratemporal actions.\\\" Report to the \\nAttorney General, supra note 2, at 26\\u201327. This \\ninterpretation of religion is both accurate to the Founders' understanding and consistent with their view that religion encompasses \\\"duties that were \\nbeyond the jurisdiction of the state either to \\nprescribe or to proscribe.\\\" Id., at 9. To the Founders, \\nreligion encompassed a subservience to a \\n 13\\n\\\"transcendent reality,\\\" which if abandoned could \\nunleash \\\"extratemporal consequences.\\\" Id., at 29. \\nThis explains their motivation to preserve a robust freedom from government \\\"interfere[nce] with such \\nbeliefs or duties.\\\" Id. \\nB. The Founding Generation's understanding of religious liberty \\nencompassed protection for believers \\nfrom compelled speech that violates \\nfirmly held religious beliefs. \\n1. The least controversial point about the phrase \\n\\\"free exercise\\\" is that \\\"by definition, the words denote action or activity.\\\" Id., at 19. To the Founders, \\nreligious liberty undoubtedly included \\\"religiously motivated conduct  as well as belief.\\\" McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1488 (emphasis added). This point bears emphasis because of this Court's history rejecting \\nsuch a reading. See  Reynolds v. United States , 98 \\nU.S. 145, 164 (1878); but see Fulton v. City of Phila. , \\n141 S. Ct. 1868, 1913 (2021) (Alito, J., concurring) \\n(noting \\\"[t]he Court ha[s] repudiated that distinction\\\" in Reynolds  \\\"that the Free Exercise \\nClause protects beliefs, not conduct\\\"). \\nIn substituting the \\\"rights of conscience\\\" in favor \\nof a protection for the \\\"free exercise of religion,\\\" the \\nFramer's chose a phrase that \\\"strongly connoted \\naction,\\\" in place of one that suggested mere opinion \\nor belief. McConnell, Origins, at 1489. Leading \\ndictionaries of that era defined \\\"exercise\\\" to include \\n\\\"[l]abour of the body,\\\" \\\"[t]ask; that which one is \\nappointed to perform,\\\" \\\"[a]ct of divine worship, \\nwhether public or private,\\\" or \\\"[t]o use or practice.\\\" See id.  (collecting dictionary definitions). Conscience, \\n 14\\non the other hand, was more likely to imply a \\n\\\"natural knowledge, or the faculty that decides on \\nthe right or wrong of actions.\\\" Id. (quoting N. \\nWebster, A Dictionary of The English Language 301 (New Haven 1807)). \\nParticularly instructive on this distinction is the \\nGeorgia Charter of 1732. The Charter included \\\"a \\nliberty of conscience allowe d in the worship of God, \\nto all persons,\\\" but reserved the more exclusive right to \\\"a free exercise of religion,\\\" only to \\\"all such persons, except papists.\\\" Id., at 1489\\u201390. By granting \\nCatholics only a liberty of conscience, but not the free exercise of religion, the Georgia Charter necessarily \\nreserved a fuller right to non-Catholic worshipers. \\nOne scholar has observed that \\\"[t]he most plausible \\nreading of the provision is that it permitted Catholics \\nto believe what they wished . . . but did not permit \\nthem to put their faith into action.\\\" Id., at 1490. \\nBy including a full and robust \\\"free exercise of \\nreligion\\\" within the First Amendment, the Founders understood that they were protecting not only the \\nright for the religious to believe what their faith \\ntaught, but to put those beliefs into action. To \\nconclude otherwise would be to \\\"trivialize the idea of \\nreligion by separating thought from life, faith from \\nworks.\\\" Report to the Attorney General, supra note \\n2, at 31. Possessing \\\"a right to believe something in one's mind without the freedom to utter it, advocate it, or even translate it into life,\\\" is hardly a \\nsubstantive freedom at all. Id., at 31\\u201332. \\n2. Consistent with the Founders' understanding \\nof a robust religious liberty protection that included \\nthe right to act out your faith was the axiom that \\n 15\\naction naturally includes expression or the freedom \\nto refrain from expression that conflicts with belief. \\nAlthough early religious liberty controversies were \\nrelatively limited, the historical record includes \\nexamples of protections for religious exercise \\nintertwined with such expressive activity. \\nAn early source of common conflict, for example, \\narose around the issue of oath requirements. Oaths \\nserved as \\\"the principal means of ensuring honest \\ntestimony and solemnizing obligations.\\\" McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1467. But many early religious sects \\nrefused to take an oath, believing it was in conflict \\nwith the teachings of the New Testament.3 Id. \\nBecause oaths were required before court testimony, this refusal often left these sincere religious objectors \\nwithout access to the court system. Id. \\nIn response, many of the early colonies adopted \\nalternatives, allowing relig ious dissenters to take a \\npledge or make an affirmation rather than to swear \\nan oath. Id., at 1467\\u201368 (\\\"By 1789, virtually all of the \\nstates had enacted oath exemptions.\\\"). This simple solution permitted religious sects access to the court \\nsystem, without requiring them to act out of step \\n                                           \\n3 See Matthew 5:33-37 (\\\"Again, ye have heard that it hath \\nbeen said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, \\nbut shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: But I say unto you, \\nSwear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: Nor \\nby the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is \\nthe city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy \\nhead, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever \\nis more than these cometh of evil.\\\"). \\n 16\\nwith their religious beliefs or to make an expression \\nthey found incompatible with their faith. \\nA still more extreme example of laws yielding to \\nexpressive activities of religious sects in the \\nFounding Generation can be found in colonial \\nGeorgia. There, the Trus tees of Georgia granted \\ncertain groups of religious refugees a general exemption from the laws that allowed them \\\"to organize themselves in accordance with their own \\nfaith.\\\" Id., at 1471. One historia n described one such \\ngroup from Salzburg\\u2014which formed the town of Ebenezer\\u2014as \\\"a state within a state, a sort of \\ntheocracy under the direction of their minsters with \\ndaily conferences of the entire congregation in which \\nGod's guidance was invoked at the beginning and the \\nend.\\\" Id. Although these groups where required to \\nobey certain colonial laws pertaining to military service, property, and good governance, they were \\n\\\"otherwise free to govern themselves.\\\" Id. at 1471 \\nn.312 \\nAnother founding era example of religious \\nexemptions for expressive action appeared in North \\nCarolina and Maryland. There, laws exempted \\nmembers of certain religious sects from a \\nrequirement to remove their hat in court. Id. The \\nreligious objectors viewed such an action as \\\"a form of obeisance to secular authority forbidden by their \\nreligion.\\\" Id., at 1472. Rather than forcing members \\nof these sects to choose be tween access to the courts \\nor expressing themselves in violation of their religious beliefs, states offered an exemption. \\nWhile this example may seem trivial by today's \\nstandards, it was very mu ch on the minds of the \\n 17\\nFounding Generation. At the time, \\\"[o]ne of the most \\nnotorious courtroom cases of religious intolerance in \\nEngland involved William Penn's refusal to remove \\nhis hat when he appeared in court\\\" to face \\nindictment for speaking to  an unlawful assembly. Id. \\nWhen Penn refused to remove a court-furnished hat from his head in respect to the court, he was held in \\ncontempt and imprisoned. Id. This case attracted \\nsignificant attention in America, and undoubtedly influenced the exemptions passed in North Carolina and Maryland. Id. \\nIndeed, the importance of this exemption was \\ndemonstrated in debates over the Bill of Rights in \\nthe First Congress. Id., at 1472, n.320. In ridiculing \\nthe list of freedoms proposed to be protected, Theodore Sedgwick of Mass achusetts remarked \\\"they \\nmight have declared that a man should have a right to wear his hat if he pleased . . . but he would ask the \\ngentleman whether he thought it necessary to enter \\nthese trifles in a declaration of rights.\\\" Id. (citation \\nomitted). With unmistakable reference to the Penn case, John Page of Virginia replied: \\nThe gentleman from \\nMassachusetts . . . objects to the clause, \\nbecause the right is of so trivial a \\nnature. He supposes it no more \\nessential than whether a man has a \\nright to wear his hat or not; but let me \\nobserve to him that such rights have \\nbeen opposed, and a man has been obliged to pull off his hat when he \\nappeared before the face of authority; \\npeople have also been prevented from \\n 18\\nassembling together on their lawful \\noccasions.  \\nId. (citation omitted). Certainly, the Founders were \\nacutely aware of the potential for abuse by \\nauthorities absent a robust religious liberty \\nprotection that clearly extended to actions, including \\nreligiously motivated expression or non-expression. \\n3. Taken together, the Free Exercise Clause and \\nthe Free Speech Clause elevate the freedom not to \\nspeak out of accordance with firmly held religious beliefs to the highest echelon of First Amendment \\nprotection. This conclusion is buttressed by the First \\nAmendment's other guarantees\\u2014e.g., freedom of \\nassembly and freedom to petition the government. If \\nthe Free Exercise Clause conferred nothing more \\nthan a \\\"right to express religious beliefs,\\\" it would \\n\\\"add nothing to the First Amendment, since that right is fully protected by the right to assemble, \\nspeak, and publish.\\\" Report to the Attorney General, \\nsupra note 2, at 19. Indeed, \\\"because religious \\nexpression is doubly protected by the constitutional \\ntext\\\" it would make little sense if it were \\\"less \\nprotected in practice.\\\" Id. , at 19, n.30. \\nThe examples cited above represent a clear \\nunderstanding by the Founding Generation that civil \\nlaws, even of general applicability, must yield when they conflict with religious expression or the freedom \\nto refrain from expression on the basis of a sincerely \\nheld religious belief. As it seems early legislative \\nbodies believed exemptions in such cases were \\nrequired by the principle of free exercise, it stands to \\nreason that the Framers understood \\\"similar \\napplications of the principle\\\" would guide the courts \\n 19\\nin these cases, once \\\"entrusted with the \\nresponsibility of enforcing\\\" First Amendment \\nguarantees. McConnell, Origins, at 1473. \\nAlthough there was a dearth of litigation over \\nreligious liberty protections in the early years of the \\nRepublic, what scarce examples exist support this \\nview. Consider, for example, the earliest state court \\nopinion addressing the issue of a religious liberty exemption, People v. Phillips . In that case, the court \\nheld that the New York Constitution protected a Catholic priest from compulsory testimony to \\nmatters learned while administering the Sacrament \\nof Confession. See  id., at 1504. \\nImportant to the Phillips court was the notion \\nthat requiring testimony from the priest to \\\"what he \\nreceives in confession, is to declare that there shall \\nbe no penance; and this important branch of the Roman Catholic religion would be thus annihilated.\\\" \\nId. (citation omitted). The court did not believe it was \\ncompatible with religious liberty to compel expression that would so eviscerate a core belief of Catholic faith. Rather than establishing a special \\nprivilege for adherents to the Catholic faith, though, \\nthe court viewed its actions as necessary to ensure \\nCatholics received the same  treatment as Protestants \\n(the dominant faith at the time) in the administration of their sacraments. Id., at 1504-05. \\nThe through line to the Founding Generation's \\nunderstanding of religious liberty was a belief that \\nsuch freedom was without substantive meaning if it did not encompass expression, and non-expression, \\nrooted in religious belief. Noted Nineteenth Century \\n 20\\nConstitutional commentator, Michigan Supreme \\nCourt Justice Thomas Cooley, explained: \\nAn earnest believer usually regards it as his duty to propagate his opinions, \\nand to bring others to his views. To \\ndeprive him of this right is to take from \\nhim the power to perform what he \\nconsiders a most sacred obligation.  \\nT. Cooley, A Treatise on the Constitutional \\nLimitations 665 (7th ed. 1903). Put another way: \\nreligious freedom, as understood by the Founders, \\nnecessarily encompasses the freedom to put belief \\ninto action, to engage in expression consistent with \\nthe dogmas of your faith, and to refrain from \\nexpression that may engender extratemporal consequences. \\nII. T\\nHIS COURT 'S PRECEDENTS \\u2014ESPECIALLY ITS \\nDEMANDING APPLICATION OF THE LEAST -\\nRESTRICTIVE MEANS TEST \\u2014DEMONSTRATE \\nAGREEMENT WITH THE FOUNDING GENERATION 'S \\nROBUST RELIGIOUS LIBERTY PROTECTIONS . \\nThis Court has a commendable history of \\nrecognizing the principles discussed above. In \\nparticular, the Court's recent religious liberty \\njurisprudence has been a welcome reprieve for \\nmembers of all faith communities who have been disheartened by the antagonism of some government \\nactors. See,  e.g., Espinoza v. Mont. Dept of Revenue , \\n140 S. Ct. 2246 (2020); Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. \\nColo. Civil Rights Comm'n , 138 S. Ct. 1719 (2018); \\nHosanna-Tabor , 565 U.S. 171. \\n 21\\nOf particular note is the Court's insistence on a \\nforceful application of the strict scrutiny test to any \\nrestriction that burdens religious liberty. Indeed, \\\"in \\nthis highly sensitive constitutional area, 'only the \\ngravest abuses, endangering paramount interests, \\ngive occasion for permissible limitation.'\\\" Sherbert v. \\nVerner , 374 U.S. 398, 406 (1963) (quoting Thomas v. \\nCollins, 323 U.S. 516, 530 (1945)). \\n1. A few examples illustrate the point. Consider \\nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. , where this \\nCourt considered a government-imposed contraceptive mandate on private employers who \\nbelieved such a requirement to be against their \\nreligious beliefs. 573 U.S. 682, 726 (2014).\\n4 While \\nassuming, without deciding, that the government's \\ninterest was compelling, the Court nonetheless found \\nthat the least-restrictive-means standard was not \\nmet. Id., at 728. Identifying alternative solutions to \\nthe rigid mandate imposed by the government, the Court explained, \\\"[t]he least-restrictive-means \\nstandard is exceptionally demanding.\\\" Id.  As Justice \\nKennedy explained, religious freedom \\\"implicates more than just freedom of belief\\\"; rather \\\"[i]t means, too, the right to express those beliefs and to establish \\none's religious (or nonreligious) self-definition in the \\npolitical, civic, and econ omic life of our larger \\n                                           \\n4 Hobby Lobby  was decided under the Religious Freedom \\nRestoration Act of 1993 (\\\"RFRA\\\"), which requires as an initial \\nmatter finding a substantial government burden on the exercise of religion; if such a burden exists, the Court must determine \\nwhether there is a compelling governmental interest and that \\nthe burden is the least restrictive means of furthering that \\ninterest. Hobby Lobby , 573 U.S., at 694-95. \\n 22\\ncommunity.\\\" Id., at 736\\u201337 (Kennedy, J., \\nconcurring). \\nIn another instance, this Court found Missouri \\nviolated a church's religious  liberty guarantees under \\nthe First Amendment when it categorically denied \\ntheir participation in a grant program for playground \\nsurface materials. Trinity Lutheran Church of \\nColumbia, Inc. v. Comer , 137 S. Ct. 2012, 2017, 2025 \\n(2017). Finding that otherwise eligible grant \\nrecipients were disqualified solely because of their \\nreligious nature, this Court held that such a penalty \\nworked against the free exercise of religion and \\\"triggers the most exacting scrutiny.\\\" Id., at 2021. \\nImportantly, the harm was not the denial of the grant itself but instead was Missouri's refusal to \\neven allow the church to compete with secular \\norganizations for grant funds solely on the basis of \\nits religious identity. Id., at 2022. \\nMore recently still, this Court took up the mantle \\nof religious liberties in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia . \\nDespite the Catholic Church's over two centuries of dedication to serving the needy children of \\nPhiladelphia, the City in 2018 stopped referring foster children to the Catholic Social Services (\\\"CSS\\\") \\nafter learning the organization would not \\\"consider \\nprospective foster parents in same-sex marriages.\\\" \\nFulton , 141 S. Ct., at 1874\\u201375. Finding that \\\"it is \\nplain\\\" the City burdens CSS's \\\"religious exercise by putting it to the choice of  curtailing its mission or \\napproving relationships inconsistent with its beliefs,\\\" this Court sought a review of whether such burden \\nwas \\\"constitutionally permissible.\\\" Id., at 1876. In \\ndetermining that Philadelphia imposed an unconstitutional burden on CSS's religious exercise, \\n 23\\nFulton  admonishes that \\\"so lo ng as the government \\ncan achieve its interests in a manner that does not \\nburden religion, it must do so.\\\" Id., at 1881. \\nTaken together, the precedents of this Court \\nestablish that an exacting analysis is required in \\nreligious liberty cases to determine whether the \\ngovernment's interest is compelling, and its burden \\nnarrowly tailored to achieve that interest. The \\nexistence of an alternative means for achieving even \\na compelling interest is nearly always fatal to the government's argument.  \\n2. When religious liberty and free expression \\nconcerns intertwine, this Court has been even less \\nhesitant to invalidate an infringing law. This \\nskepticism is warranted, as attempts to compel \\nexpression that conflicts with an individual's \\nreligious beliefs are nothing more than indirect \\nattempts to regulate religion itself. \\nIn 1943, this Court took issue with a West \\nVirginia law mandating a flag salute and pledge, when its application was challenged by a group of \\nJehovah's Witnesses who said such action violated \\ntheir religious beliefs. W. Va. State Bd. Of Educ. V. \\nBarnette , 319 U.S. 624 (1943). Refusing to find that \\n\\\"a Bill of Rights which guards the individual's right \\nto speak his own mind, left it open to public \\nauthorities to compel him to utter what is not on his \\nmind,\\\" the Barnette  Court blocked the law's \\nenforcement. Id. , at 634; see also  id., at 645 (Murphy, \\nJ., concurring) (recognizing \\\"[t]he right of freedom of thought and of religion as guaranteed by the \\nConstitution against State action includes both the \\nright to speak freely and the right to refrain from \\n 24\\nspeaking at all\\\"). Underlying the Court's opinion was \\nthe belief that \\\"[i]f there is any fixed star in our \\nconstitutional constellation, it is that no official, high \\nor petty, can prescribe what  shall be orthodox in \\npolitics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act \\ntheir faith therein.\\\" Id., at 642. \\nExpanding on the holding in Barnette , the Court \\nin Wooley v. Maynard  considered a religious \\nobjection to display of the New Hampshire state motto\\u2014\\\"Live Free or Die\\\"\\u2014on the license plate of a \\ncar owned by Jehovah's Witness. 430 U.S. 705 (1977). In Wooley , the Court expressly rejected the \\nidea that \\\"the State may constitutionally require an individual to participate in the dissemination of an \\nideological message by displaying it on his private \\nproperty.\\\" Id., at 713. \\nFoundational to its decision was the Court's \\nholding that the freedoms contained within the First \\nAmendment \\\"includes both the right to speak freely \\nand the right to refrain from speaking at all.\\\" Id., at \\n714. It matters not whether most agree with the message the State seeks to force a person to convey; the First Amendment unquestionably \\\"protects the \\nright of individuals to hold a point of view different \\nfrom the majority and to refu se to foster . . . an idea \\nthey find morally objectionable.\\\" Id. , at 715. Finding \\nthe existence of a governmental burden, the Court \\nwas left to question whether a substantial \\ngovernmental interest existed and, if so, whether the \\nburden was narrowly tailored to advance that \\ninterest. Even assuming a legitimate and substantial interest, the Court concluded \\\"that purpose cannot \\nbe pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental \\n 25\\npersonal liberties when the end can be more \\nnarrowly achieved.\\\" Id., at 716. New Hampshire \\nfailed that test. \\nIn still another line of cases, this Court found \\nthat it violated Constitutional protections to subject religious observants, who went door to door \\ndistributing religious materials and soliciting for the \\npurchase of religious books, to a government \\nsolicitation registration requirement. Murdock v. \\nPennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105 (1943); see also Follett v. \\nTown of McCormick , 321 U.S. 573 (1944). \\nAcknowledging that the practice was derived from the believer's understanding that he was \\\"obeying a \\ncommandment of God,\\\" the Court found that the First Amendment prohibited the imposition of a \\ngenerally applicable registration requirement to \\nengage in such conduct. Murdock , 319 U.S., at 108, \\n117. Indeed, the Court went out of its way to describe the literature being distributed as \\\"provocative, \\nabusive, and ill-mannered.\\\" Id., at 115\\u201316. \\nNevertheless, \\\"[p]lainly  a community may not \\nsuppress . . . the dissemination of views because they \\nare unpopular, annoying or distasteful.\\\" Id.,  at 116 \\nTo allow otherwise would \\\"be a complete repudiation of the philosophy of the Bill of Rights.\\\" Id. \\nThe Court went further still , establishing that the \\nmere fact the religious materials were being \\\"sold\\\" was not enough to transform \\\"evangelism into a \\ncommercial enterprise.\\\" Id., at 111. As such, the \\nCourt acknowledged heightened constitutional protections for \\\"those spreading their religious \\nbeliefs through the spoken and printed word.\\\" Id. As \\ncompared to purely commercial activity, \\\"[f]reedom of \\n 26\\npress, freedom of speech, fr eedom of religion are in a \\npreferred position.\\\" Id., at 115. \\nEven Employment Division v. Smith , often \\ncriticized as having watered down constitutional \\nreligious liberty protections, recognized the Court's \\nunique hostility toward burdens that implicate both \\nthe free exercise of religion and the freedom of \\nspeech. The \\\"First Amendment bars application of a \\nneutral, generally applicable law to religiously \\nmotivated action\\\" when that action \\\"involve[s] not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but the Free \\nExercise Clause in conjunction with other \\nconstitutional protections, such as freedom of \\nspeech.\\\" Empl. Div. v. Smith , 494 U.S. 872, 881\\u201382 \\n(1990). Even some preceden ts, decided on free speech \\ngrounds alone, were undoubtedly reinforced by \\ntouches of freedom-of-religion concerns. Id. \\n3. This much is clear: the arc of this Court's \\nprecedent bends in one incontrovertible direction. \\nScrutiny of any government burden is at its zenith \\nwhen the burden effects an individual's exercise of their religious beliefs in a manner that implicates \\nfree speech protections. This conclusion, rooted in the \\nhistory and tradition of religious exercise as \\nunderstood by the Founders and enshrined in the \\nFirst Amendment, demands that any such burden be \\nsubjected to the most rigorous application of strict \\nscrutiny analysis. \\nIt is precisely for this reason that, to the best of \\nAmicus Curiae's knowledge, the Court has never \\nissued an opinion finding that governmentally \\ncompelled religious speech satisfies strict scrutiny. \\nSee 303 Creative Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Elenis , 6 F.4th \\n 27\\n1160, 1191 (U.S. 10th Cir. 2021) (Tymkovich, C.J., \\ndissenting) (\\\"[T]he majority takes the remarkable\\u2014\\nand novel\\u2014stance that the government may force \\nMs. Smith to produce messages that violate her \\nconscience. . . . No case has ever gone so far.\\\"). \\nThis case should not be the first. \\nIII. THE TENTH CIRCUIT 'S OPINION CANNOT BE \\nSQUARED EITHER WITH THE FIRST \\nAMENDMENT 'S RICH HISTORY OR THIS COURT 'S \\nPROTECTION OF BELIEVERS ' FREE SPEECH \\nRIGHTS . \\nIn its permissive application of strict scrutiny, the \\nTenth Circuit bastardized this Court's protection of free speech rights, especially as applied to religious \\nexpression. If allowed to stand, its precedent will give license to courts across this Country to \\nhumiliate members of all religious sects by \\ncompelling them to speak in contravention of their \\nsincerely held religious beliefs. By purporting to \\napply strict scrutiny, the Tenth Circuit's opinion \\ncheapened the First Amendment rights of Catholics, \\nProtestants, Muslims, Jews, and all other believers alike. \\nLuckily, this precedent d oes not need to stand. \\nThis Court, once again, has an opportunity to \\nadmonish that the free speech protections of \\nbelievers are no less than non-believers and, in fact, \\nare heightened when faced with government \\nregulation that would compel speech antithetical to the tenants of a believer's faith. The First \\nAmendment commands such a result. \\n 28\\nAlthough the Tenth Circuit rightly concluded that \\nMs. Smith's website designs are \\\"pure speech,\\\" 303 \\nCreative LLC, 6 F.4th, at 1176, the Tenth Circuit \\nwrongly concludes that the commercial nature of Ms. \\nSmith's speech gives Colorado a regulatory hook to \\nlatch onto. Id., at 1179. By failing to acknowledge the \\nreligious nature of her objection to the would-be compelled speech, the Tenth Circuit did not afford \\nher First Amendment rights the \\\"preferred\\\" status \\nthey deserve.\\n5 Cf., Murdock , 319 U.S., at 115. What \\nis remarkable is that the religious nature of Ms. Smith's objection is not disputed. See 303 \\nCreative, 6 F. 4th, at 1172 (Ms. Smith is \\\"willing to create custom graphics and websites for gay, lesbian, \\nor bisexual clients . . . so long as the custom graphics \\nand websites do not violate [her] religious beliefs, as is true for all customers.\\\" (internal quotation marks \\nomitted)); id., at 1192 (Tymkovich, C.J., dissenting) \\n(\\\"In short, Colorado appear s to agree that Ms. Smith \\ndoes not distinguish between customers based on \\nprotected-class status and thus advances the aims of \\nCADA. But when any customer asks Ms. Smith to \\ncreate expressive content that violates her sincerely \\nheld beliefs, she will decline the request.\\\"). \\n                                           \\n5 Remarkably, the Tenth Circuit  suggests that its sweeping \\nholding may not apply to \\\"all artists\\\" if they were not engaged \\nin \\\"commercial activity,\\\" but rather \\\"commissioning a mural for some charitable purpose.\\\" 303 Creative , 6 F.4th, at 1182, n.6. To \\nsuggest that a local artist wh o refuses to paint a Christian \\nmural for a church may enjoy more constitutional protections \\nthan a woman called to live out her sincerely held religious \\nbeliefs by creating custom wedding websites is, thankfully, not supported by the history or tradition of the First Amendment \\nand the muscular protections it affords religious believers. \\n 29\\nThis failure is compounded by the Tenth Circuit's \\nfallacy of a marketplace of one for Ms. Smith's \\nspeech. Id. at 1180. Such convenient analysis \\nallowed the court to conclude \\\"there are no less intrusive means of providing equal access to those  \\ntypes of services.\\\" Id. (emphasis added). But this \\nclever reasoning flips this Court's precedent on its \\nhead. Rather than prioritize the religious speaker's \\nobjection in search of a less restrictive means, the \\ncourt below merely concluded that she is the only one and therefore no other means will suffice. But, \\nwhere, as here, the government can achieve its interests without burdening religion, the \\nConstitution requires it to do so. Fulton , 141 S. Ct., \\nat 1881. The analysis is also anomalous in the free speech context because it cannot be that the more \\nunique and distinctive the speech, the less  First \\nAmendment protection it deserves. But that is the staggering breadth of the Tenth Circuit majority's \\nconclusion. See 303 Creative , 6 F.4th, at 1204-05 \\n(Tymkovich, C.J., dissenting).  \\nMoreover, by categorizing Ms. Smith as nothing \\nmore than a \\\"public accommodation,\\\" the Tenth \\nCircuit minimized her right to participate in the \\nmarketplace, even as a woman of faith. See 303 \\nCreative, 6 F.4th, at 1181 (\\\"[W]hether an exception limits market access depends upon the uniqueness of \\nthe public accommodation's goods and services\\u2014not \\nthe sincerity of the public accommodation's beliefs.\\\"). \\nTo deny a benefit to those \\\"who engage in certain \\nforms of speech is in effect to penalize them for such \\nspeech,\\\" and constitutionally, no different than \\nconditioning a benefit on a person's \\\"willingness to \\nviolate a cardinal principle of her religious faith;\\\" the \\n 30\\nresult is the same: to \\\"deter[] or discourage[] the \\nexercise of First Amendment rights of expression.\\\" \\nSherbert , 374 U.S., at 405-06 (citing Speiser v. \\nRandall, 357 U.S. 513, 518 (1958)). Here too, Colorado seeks to impose the same constitutional \\nharm: speak in violation of your core religious faith \\nor lose the benefit of marketplace participation. Put \\nsimply, Colorado seeks to punish Ms. Smith for her \\nsincerely held religious beliefs. See also Trinity \\nLutheran Church , 137 S. Ct., at 2021\\u201322 (finding a \\nconstitutional violation where a burden puts \\nreligious believers \\\"to a choice: [] participate in an \\notherwise available benefit\\\" or maintain your \\nreligious identity). \\nThe same fundamental principle must apply to \\nfree speech and religious practices when they act in concert: \\\"In an open, pluralistic, self-governing \\nsociety, the expression of an idea cannot be \\nsuppressed simply because some find it offensive, \\ninsulting, or even wounding.\\\" Fulton , 141 S. Ct., at \\n1924-25 (Alito, J., concurring). To lose this principle is to lose the \\\"preservation of religious freedom.\\\" Id., \\nat 1925. That is because \\\"[s]uppressing speech\\u2014or \\nreligious practice\\u2014simply because it expresses an idea that some find hurtful is a zero-sum game.\\\" Id. \\nThis Court's jurisprudence confirms this link \\nbetween religious exercise and free speech because \\nthis Court's opinions \\\"make it perfectly clear that \\ndiscrimination against religious, as opposed to \\nsecular, expression is viewpoint discrimination.\\\" \\nNurre v. Whitehead , 559 U.S. 1025, 1028 (2010) \\n(Alito, J., dissenting). And because viewpoint discrimination is \\\"an egregious form of content \\ndiscrimination,\\\" Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of \\n 31\\nthe Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995), it brings \\nwith it heightened constitutional skepticism. \\nAlthough some may find Ms. Smith's religious \\nbeliefs objectionable, \\\"religions, and those who \\nadhere to religious doctrines, may continue to \\nadvocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by \\ndivine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be \\ncondoned.\\\" Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U.S. 644, 679 \\n(2015). \\\"An open society can keep that promise while still respecting the 'dignity,' 'worth,' and fundamental equality of all members of the \\ncommunity.\\\" Fulton , 141 S. Ct., at 1925 (Alito, J., \\nconcurring) (quoting Masterpiece Cakeshop , 138 S. \\nCt., at 1727). Ms. Smith should be free to practice all \\naspects of her faith, without fear of government-\\ncompelled expression against her sincerely held \\nreligious beliefs. The Constitution demands no less. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_content_alt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3958,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"........................................................ 31 \\n \\n       \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\niii \\n \\nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES  \\n \\nCASES  \\n  \\n303 Creative Ltd.

While debating the extent to \\nwhich the Constitution should enshrine protections for religious freedom during the First Congress, \\nRepresentative Daniel Carroll of Maryland\\u2014one of \\nthe few Catholics among the Constitution's \\nFramers\\u2014remarked \\\"the rights of conscience are, in \\ntheir nature, of peculiar delicacy, and will little bear \\nthe gentlest touch of governmental hand.\\\" 1 Annals \\nof Cong. 757-58 (Joseph Gales ed., 1834) (Aug. 15, 1789). \\nNowhere are the rights of the religious more \\ndelicate than when they intersect with the freedom \\nto put faith into action, belief into words. If the \\nrobust religious freedom protections guaranteed by \\nour Constitution are to have any meaning, they must \\nbe capable of shielding a sincere religious believer from being coerced into speaking against the core \\ntenants of her faith. To hold otherwise would be to \\npermit the heavy hand of government to extinguish \\nreligious practice. This the Constitution will not \\nallow. \\nThe Founders understood that the First \\nAmendment, as drafted, protected all religious sects in their right to speak freely in accordance with their \\nfaith. Indeed, the Founding Generation believed \\nprotections for religious lib erty to be of utmost \\nimport. Since its founding, America has been gripped \\n 3 \\nin debate over religious liberty. Even before the \\ncolonies declared their independence, there were \\nenergetic discussions over the bounds of religious \\ntoleration versus a full freedom to exercise religion \\n(with only limited exceptions). Ultimately, the \\nConstitution's drafters settled on James Madison's \\nview of an unalienable right to practice one's \\nreligious faith. Owed to an understanding that the Governor of the Universe supersedes any earthly \\nauthority, religious convictions were understood to \\ncommand greater deference than mere personal \\nopinions. Where opinion was required to yield to the \\nlaw, tensions between law and religious belief often \\nresulted in exemption for the believer. \\nThe Founding Generation also viewed religious \\nliberty as encompassing more  than mere matters of \\nconscience or decisions on the rightness or wrongness \\nof acts. Instead, the full ex ercise of religion offered a \\nright to act in accordance with one's faith and, \\nnecessarily, included protection from government \\ncompelled speech that violated a believer's firmly \\nheld religious convictions. This distinction was \\nperhaps most clearly expressed in the early colonies' \\nanti-Catholic prejudices. In colonial Georgia, for example, while all worshipers were vested by its \\nCharter with a liberty of conscience, Catholics were \\nexpressly excluded from protections for the more \\nrobust free exercise of religion. McConnell, The \\nOrigins and Historical Understanding of Free \\nExercise of Religion, 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1409, 1489-90 \\n(1989) (hereinafter McConnell, Origins). \\nInformed by the debates and experiences of their \\ntime, the Founders opted to include among the Constitution's protections the more extensive free \\n 4 \\nexercise of religion. In so doing, they extended the \\nmaximum protections available to all who professed \\nbelief in a Universal Sovereign. These protections, it \\nwas understood, included a right to act out belief and \\nto speak, or refrain from speaking, freely, in \\naccordance with faith. \\nWith this understanding as background, it is \\nclear the First Amendment provides dual protections for religious expression (or non-expression) in its \\nguarantees of free speech and free religious exercise. \\nThis reality compels the conclusion that religious \\nspeech enjoys the highest constitutional protection. \\nCertainly, this is consistent with the Founders' \\nunderstanding of robust religious liberty protections, \\nas revealed in the text, history, and tradition of the First Amendment. \\nThis Court's recent religious liberty jurisprudence \\nconcurs with the Founders' view of full-throated \\nreligious liberty protection. Religious observers have \\nwelcomed the relief from government oppression. No \\nlonger can religious believers be excluded solely \\nbecause of their religious identity. Free are the religious to express their religious views without fear \\nof government reprisal. This Court's precedents have \\nbeen unequivocal: if government can achieve its \\nmeans without burdening religion, the Constitution \\nalmost always requires that it must. \\nAnother truism is derived from this Court's \\nprecedents. When religious liberty concerns are coupled with free expression, the Constitution \\ndemands the most exacting scrutiny. That is because \\nthe First Amendment, as understood from the \\nFounding, provides special protection for the \\n 5 \\nreligious, their right to speak freely, and their right \\nto refrain from speaking. Distinct from pure \\ncommercial speech, religious speech demands a \\nhigher constitutional protection. That is why, to \\nAmicus Curiae's knowledge, government compelled \\nreligious speech has never been held to survive strict \\nscrutiny. \\nAgainst this backdrop, the Tenth Circuit's opinion \\ncannot stand. Although purporting to apply strict scrutiny, the Tenth Circuit's analysis is rife with \\nflaws, each one fatal to the court's conclusion. From \\nthe outset, the Tenth Circuit failed to recognize the \\npreferred status of Ms. Smith's free speech rights, \\ngrounded as they are in her religious beliefs. This \\nfailure is only compounded by the Tenth Circuit's lethargic narrow-tailoring analysis. Far from the \\nexacting analysis this Court requires, the Tenth \\nCircuit settles into a now familiar pattern to those of \\nfaith\\u2014ostracizing Ms. Smith from society because of \\nher religious identity. \\nOnce again, this Court must reverse yet another \\nassault on religious freedom by declaring that where, as here, free speech and religion intersect, \\nconstitutional protections are at their greatest. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 6 \\nARGUMENT \\nI. AS ORIGINALLY UNDERSTOOD , THE FIRST \\nAMENDMENT PROTECTED THE RIGHT OF THE \\nRELIGIOUS TO SPEAK AND TO REMAIN SILENT . \\nThe First Amendment is \\\"unique in form among \\namendments to the Constitution.\\\"2 It is drafted, not \\nas a grant of privileges or rights to the people, but as \\na disability on Congress' ability to act. Report to the Attorney General, supra  note 2, at 15\\u201316. In its \\nentirety, the First Amendment reads: \\nCongress shall make no law respecting \\nan establishment of religion, or \\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; or \\nabridging the freedom of speech, or of \\nthe press; or the right of the people \\npeaceably to assemble, and to petition \\nthe Government for a redress of grievances.  \\nU.S.\\n Const., Amdt. 1. \\nIn barring certain kinds of laws, the First \\nAmendment recognizes a pre-existing \\\"immun[ity] from such legislative action.\\\" Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral, supra note 2, at 16. This reflects an \\nunderstanding by the Founding Generation that these \\\"are pre-existent rights\\u2014inalienable rights\\u2014\\n                                           \\n2 O f f i c e  o f  L e g a l  P o l i c y ,  D e p t  o f  J u s t i c e ,  R e p o r t  t o  t h e  \\nAttorney General: Religious Li berty Under the Free Exercise \\nClause at 15 (1986) (hereinafter Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral). \\n 7 \\nand not mere civil privileges conferred by a \\nbenevolent sovereign.\\\" Id. \\nTaken together, the text, history, and philosophy \\nof the First Amendment establish the principle that \\n\\\"the government has no right to interfere with the \\nfree exercise of religion\\\" unless the \\\"government \\naction is necessary to prevent manifest danger to the \\nexistence of the state; to protect public peace, safety, \\nand order; or to secure the religious liberty of \\nothers.\\\" Id., at v. And, even then, only if the \\ngovernment deploys \\\"the least restrictive means \\nnecessary to protect these interests.\\\" Id. This is true \\nas a matter of the First Amendment's Religious Liberty Clauses. And because freedom of religion \\ncannot be divorced from freedom of expression, it is \\neven more true when the government tries to force a \\nbeliever to speak in a way that cannot be reconciled \\nwith her religious convictions. \\nA. Religious liberty was profoundly \\nimportant to the Founding Generation; \\nreligious convictions were understood \\nto receive greater deference than mere \\npersonal opinion. \\n1. The Founding Generation was uniquely \\nattuned to issues regarding the proper relationship \\nbetween religion and government. Indeed, at the time of America's founding there was \\\"an intense and \\ncontroversial theoretical debate\\\" of these issues \\ninvolving \\\"[m]ost of the great political thinkers of the \\nperiod.\\\" McConnell, Origins, at 1430. These thinkers \\ninformed the Founders' own debates on the issue and \\nundoubtedly \\\"influenced the American solution to \\nthe problem.\\\" Id.  \\n 8 \\nJohn Locke, perhaps more than any other \\nphilosopher who contributed to the ideas \\nunderpinning America's founding, provided the \\n\\\"most extensive\\\" discussion of religion and most \\ndirectly influenced the Framers' drafting of the First \\nAmendment. Id. Locke was an early and influential \\ntheoretical thinker and advocate for religious freedom. Id., at 1431. In his view \\\"religious rivalry \\nand intolerance\\\" were \\\"among the most important of political problems,\\\" and \\\"[r]eligious intolerance was inconsistent both with public peace and with good \\ngovernment.\\\" Id. \\nLocke's solution, however, was an \\\"understanding \\nof religious toleration,\\\" that \\\"expressly precludes free \\nexercise exemptions.\\\" Id., at 1435. To Locke, when \\n\\\"individual conscience conflicts with the governmental policy, the government will always \\nprevail and the individual will always be forced to \\nsubmit or suffer the punishment.\\\" Id. Locke's \\ninfluence on the drafters of the First Amendment makes it all the more remarkable that his view did \\nnot triumph with America's founding. \\nThe American Revolution upended the \\npreexisting relationship between religion and government, especially in states where the Anglican \\nChurch had the most influence. Id., at 1436. \\n\\\"America was in the wake of a great religious \\nrevival,\\\" that brought with it a \\\"drive for religious \\nfreedom.\\\" Id., at 1437\\u201338. Along with this drive came \\na push from \\\"religious supporters of disestablishment and free exercise\\\" to enshrine \\n\\\"constitutional protections\\\" for religious freedoms \\\"at the federal level.\\\" Id., at 1440. \\n 9 \\nThis movement was encapsulated in debate \\nsurrounding the religious liberty clause in Virginia's \\n1776 Bill of Rights. When George Mason proposed \\nusing the Lockean phrase \\\"toleration of religion,\\\" \\nJames Madison objected, complaining that the \\nphrase implied an act of legislative grace (which, to \\nLocke, it did). Id. , at 1443. Madison was not alone \\namong the Founding Generation in rejecting this concept. George Washin gton and Thomas Paine \\nsimilarly eschewed \\\"toleration,\\\" decrying its \\nimplication of government \\\"indulgence\\\" rather than a \\nfundamental, preexisting right. Id., at 1443\\u201344. \\nMoreover, Madison objected to Mason's proposal \\nbecause it excepted from even the \\\"toleration\\\" of \\nreligious freedom any instance where \\\"under color of \\nreligion any man disturb the peace, the happiness, or \\nsafety of society.\\\" See G. Hunt, James Madison and \\nReligious Liberty, 1 Ann. Rep. Am. Hist. A. 163, 166 \\n(1901). It was Madison's belief that such phrasing \\n\\\"might easily be so twisted as to oppress religious \\nsects under the excuse that they disturbed 'the \\npeace, the happiness, or safety of society.'\\\" Id. \\nMadison's objections were heard by Virginia's \\nassembly. As adopted, Virginia's Bill of Rights \\npromised that all \\\"are equally entitled to the free \\nexercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience,\\\" and reminded only \\\"that\\n it is the mutual \\nduty of all to practice Christian forbearance, love, and charity towards each other.\\\" Report to the \\nAttorney General, supra  note 2, at 102\\u201303. \\n2. This early debate between Madison and Mason \\nbears witness to what this Court has long noted\\u2014\\nthat Madison was \\\"the leading architect of the \\n 10\\nreligion clauses of the First Amendment.\\\" Hosanna-\\nTabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v. \\nEEOC , 565 U.S. 171, 184 (2012) (internal quotation \\nmarks omitted). Madison's rejection of religious \\ntolerance in favor of full and free religious expression permeates his Memorial and Remonstrance . \\nExplaining that \\\"[t]he Religion then of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every \\nman,\\\" Madison understood that it is not just \\\"the \\nright of every man to exercise it as these may \\ndictate,\\\" but further \\\"the duty of every man to render \\nto the Creator such homage, and such only, as he \\nbelieves to be acceptable to him.\\\" J. Madison, \\nMemorial and Remonstrance \\u00a7 1 (1785), reprinted in \\nEverson v. Bd. of Educ. , 330 U.S. 1, 64 (1947). This \\nright, Madison admonished, \\\"is in its nature an unalienable right.\\\" Id. \\nMadison expounded his view that \\\"[t]his duty is \\nprecedent both in order of time and degree of \\nobligation, to the claims of Civil Society.\\\" Id. Before \\nanyone is \\\"a member of Civil Society,\\\" they are \\\"considered as a subject of the Governor of the \\nUniverse.\\\" Id. For this reason, \\\"in matters of \\nReligion, no man's right is abridged by the institution of Civil Society.\\\" Id. But Madison went \\nfurther. \\\"[I]f religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that \\nof the Legislative Body.\\\" Id., at \\u00a7 2, reprinted in \\nEverson , 330 U.S., at 65. Legislators who \\n\\\"encroach[]\\\" on the rights of the people, Madison \\nsaid, \\\"exceed the commission from which they derive their authority, and are Tyrants.\\\" Id. \\nRecognizing that Madison's Memorial and \\nRemonstrance is not law, see City of Boerne v. Flores , \\n 11\\n521 U.S. 507, 541 (1997) (Scalia, J., concurring), it \\nnonetheless offers a clear understanding of why the \\nFounding Generation thought it so crucial to \\nmemorialize the inalienable freedom of religion in \\nthe First Amendment. And Madison's defense of the \\nAmerican conception of religious liberty merely \\nechoed the prevalent thought at the founding \\\"of the \\ndifference between religious faith and other forms of human judgment.\\\" McConnell, Origins, at 1496. \\nAt the Founding, the prevailing view was that the \\n\\\"opinions of individuals\\\" can not take \\\"precedence \\nover the decisions of civil society.\\\" Id. The same was \\nnot true for religious convictions. \\\"Conflicts arising from religious convictions were conceived not as a \\nclash between the judgment of the individual and of \\nthe state, but as a conflict between earthly and \\nspiritual sovereigns.\\\" Id. In those instances, the \\nperson holding the religious conviction \\\"was not seen as the instigator of the conflict; the believer was simply caught between the inconsistent demands of \\ntwo rightful authorities, through no fault of his own.\\\" \\nId. This view is essential to understanding the \\nFounders' belief that \\\"freedom of religion is unalienable because it is a duty to God and not a \\nprivilege of the individual.\\\" Id., at 1497. \\n3. Bolstering this understanding, the historical \\nrecord surrounding adoption of the Bill of Rights \\nsuggests that the First Amendment's use of the term \\\"religion\\\" was a deliberate choice. See McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1488. Although \\\"[t]he recorded debates \\nin\\\" both chambers of Congress \\\"cast little light on the \\nmeaning of the free exercise clause,\\\" looking at \\nsuccessive drafts of the clause from its consideration \\nand debate in the First Congress are especially \\n 12\\nenlightening. Id., at 1481, 1483. While earlier drafts \\nof the First Amendment used the phrase \\\"rights of \\nconscience,\\\" the final version that emerged enshrined in the First Amendment a protection for the \\\"free \\nexercise of religion.\\\" Id., at 1488. This phrasing lends \\nfurther support to the Founders' understanding of religious freedoms. \\nTo the Founders, \\\"[b]elief in a Supreme Being \\nwas\\\" essential to \\\"religion.\\\" Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral, supra  note 2, at 9. Indeed, \\\"[t]he historical \\nmaterials uniformly equate 'religion' with belief in God or in gods.\\\" McConnell, Origins, at 1493. These references \\\"can be extended without distortion to \\ntranscendent extrapersonal authorities not \\nenvisioned in traditionally theistic terms\\\"\\u2014for \\nexample, Madison's use of \\\"Creator,\\\" \\\"Governor of \\nthe Universe,\\\" and \\\"Universal Sovereign,\\\" imply \\\"an attempt at a definition more compendious than the \\nfamiliar Judeo-Christian God, but it retains the distinction between transcendent authority and \\npersonal judgment.\\\" Id.  \\nReligion, as understood by the Founders and \\nexpressed in the First Amendment, then, is best \\ndefined to encompass \\\"a system of beliefs, whether \\npersonally or institutionally held, prompted by the \\nacceptance of transcendent realities or \\nacknowledging extratemporal actions.\\\" Report to the \\nAttorney General, supra note 2, at 26\\u201327. This \\ninterpretation of religion is both accurate to the Founders' understanding and consistent with their view that religion encompasses \\\"duties that were \\nbeyond the jurisdiction of the state either to \\nprescribe or to proscribe.\\\" Id., at 9. To the Founders, \\nreligion encompassed a subservience to a \\n 13\\n\\\"transcendent reality,\\\" which if abandoned could \\nunleash \\\"extratemporal consequences.\\\" Id., at 29. \\nThis explains their motivation to preserve a robust freedom from government \\\"interfere[nce] with such \\nbeliefs or duties.\\\" Id. \\nB. The Founding Generation's understanding of religious liberty \\nencompassed protection for believers \\nfrom compelled speech that violates \\nfirmly held religious beliefs. \\n1. The least controversial point about the phrase \\n\\\"free exercise\\\" is that \\\"by definition, the words denote action or activity.\\\" Id., at 19. To the Founders, \\nreligious liberty undoubtedly included \\\"religiously motivated conduct  as well as belief.\\\" McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1488 (emphasis added). This point bears emphasis because of this Court's history rejecting \\nsuch a reading. See  Reynolds v. United States , 98 \\nU.S. 145, 164 (1878); but see Fulton v. City of Phila. , \\n141 S. Ct. 1868, 1913 (2021) (Alito, J., concurring) \\n(noting \\\"[t]he Court ha[s] repudiated that distinction\\\" in Reynolds  \\\"that the Free Exercise \\nClause protects beliefs, not conduct\\\"). \\nIn substituting the \\\"rights of conscience\\\" in favor \\nof a protection for the \\\"free exercise of religion,\\\" the \\nFramer's chose a phrase that \\\"strongly connoted \\naction,\\\" in place of one that suggested mere opinion \\nor belief. McConnell, Origins, at 1489. Leading \\ndictionaries of that era defined \\\"exercise\\\" to include \\n\\\"[l]abour of the body,\\\" \\\"[t]ask; that which one is \\nappointed to perform,\\\" \\\"[a]ct of divine worship, \\nwhether public or private,\\\" or \\\"[t]o use or practice.\\\" See id.  (collecting dictionary definitions). Conscience, \\n 14\\non the other hand, was more likely to imply a \\n\\\"natural knowledge, or the faculty that decides on \\nthe right or wrong of actions.\\\" Id. (quoting N. \\nWebster, A Dictionary of The English Language 301 (New Haven 1807)). \\nParticularly instructive on this distinction is the \\nGeorgia Charter of 1732. The Charter included \\\"a \\nliberty of conscience allowe d in the worship of God, \\nto all persons,\\\" but reserved the more exclusive right to \\\"a free exercise of religion,\\\" only to \\\"all such persons, except papists.\\\" Id., at 1489\\u201390. By granting \\nCatholics only a liberty of conscience, but not the free exercise of religion, the Georgia Charter necessarily \\nreserved a fuller right to non-Catholic worshipers. \\nOne scholar has observed that \\\"[t]he most plausible \\nreading of the provision is that it permitted Catholics \\nto believe what they wished . . . but did not permit \\nthem to put their faith into action.\\\" Id., at 1490. \\nBy including a full and robust \\\"free exercise of \\nreligion\\\" within the First Amendment, the Founders understood that they were protecting not only the \\nright for the religious to believe what their faith \\ntaught, but to put those beliefs into action. To \\nconclude otherwise would be to \\\"trivialize the idea of \\nreligion by separating thought from life, faith from \\nworks.\\\" Report to the Attorney General, supra note \\n2, at 31. Possessing \\\"a right to believe something in one's mind without the freedom to utter it, advocate it, or even translate it into life,\\\" is hardly a \\nsubstantive freedom at all. Id., at 31\\u201332. \\n2. Consistent with the Founders' understanding \\nof a robust religious liberty protection that included \\nthe right to act out your faith was the axiom that \\n 15\\naction naturally includes expression or the freedom \\nto refrain from expression that conflicts with belief. \\nAlthough early religious liberty controversies were \\nrelatively limited, the historical record includes \\nexamples of protections for religious exercise \\nintertwined with such expressive activity. \\nAn early source of common conflict, for example, \\narose around the issue of oath requirements. Oaths \\nserved as \\\"the principal means of ensuring honest \\ntestimony and solemnizing obligations.\\\" McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1467. But many early religious sects \\nrefused to take an oath, believing it was in conflict \\nwith the teachings of the New Testament.3 Id. \\nBecause oaths were required before court testimony, this refusal often left these sincere religious objectors \\nwithout access to the court system. Id. \\nIn response, many of the early colonies adopted \\nalternatives, allowing relig ious dissenters to take a \\npledge or make an affirmation rather than to swear \\nan oath. Id., at 1467\\u201368 (\\\"By 1789, virtually all of the \\nstates had enacted oath exemptions.\\\"). This simple solution permitted religious sects access to the court \\nsystem, without requiring them to act out of step \\n                                           \\n3 See Matthew 5:33-37 (\\\"Again, ye have heard that it hath \\nbeen said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, \\nbut shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: But I say unto you, \\nSwear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: Nor \\nby the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is \\nthe city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy \\nhead, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever \\nis more than these cometh of evil.\\\"). \\n 16\\nwith their religious beliefs or to make an expression \\nthey found incompatible with their faith. \\nA still more extreme example of laws yielding to \\nexpressive activities of religious sects in the \\nFounding Generation can be found in colonial \\nGeorgia. There, the Trus tees of Georgia granted \\ncertain groups of religious refugees a general exemption from the laws that allowed them \\\"to organize themselves in accordance with their own \\nfaith.\\\" Id., at 1471. One historia n described one such \\ngroup from Salzburg\\u2014which formed the town of Ebenezer\\u2014as \\\"a state within a state, a sort of \\ntheocracy under the direction of their minsters with \\ndaily conferences of the entire congregation in which \\nGod's guidance was invoked at the beginning and the \\nend.\\\" Id. Although these groups where required to \\nobey certain colonial laws pertaining to military service, property, and good governance, they were \\n\\\"otherwise free to govern themselves.\\\" Id. at 1471 \\nn.312 \\nAnother founding era example of religious \\nexemptions for expressive action appeared in North \\nCarolina and Maryland. There, laws exempted \\nmembers of certain religious sects from a \\nrequirement to remove their hat in court. Id. The \\nreligious objectors viewed such an action as \\\"a form of obeisance to secular authority forbidden by their \\nreligion.\\\" Id., at 1472. Rather than forcing members \\nof these sects to choose be tween access to the courts \\nor expressing themselves in violation of their religious beliefs, states offered an exemption. \\nWhile this example may seem trivial by today's \\nstandards, it was very mu ch on the minds of the \\n 17\\nFounding Generation. At the time, \\\"[o]ne of the most \\nnotorious courtroom cases of religious intolerance in \\nEngland involved William Penn's refusal to remove \\nhis hat when he appeared in court\\\" to face \\nindictment for speaking to  an unlawful assembly. Id. \\nWhen Penn refused to remove a court-furnished hat from his head in respect to the court, he was held in \\ncontempt and imprisoned. Id. This case attracted \\nsignificant attention in America, and undoubtedly influenced the exemptions passed in North Carolina and Maryland. Id. \\nIndeed, the importance of this exemption was \\ndemonstrated in debates over the Bill of Rights in \\nthe First Congress. Id., at 1472, n.320. In ridiculing \\nthe list of freedoms proposed to be protected, Theodore Sedgwick of Mass achusetts remarked \\\"they \\nmight have declared that a man should have a right to wear his hat if he pleased . . . but he would ask the \\ngentleman whether he thought it necessary to enter \\nthese trifles in a declaration of rights.\\\" Id. (citation \\nomitted). With unmistakable reference to the Penn case, John Page of Virginia replied: \\nThe gentleman from \\nMassachusetts . . . objects to the clause, \\nbecause the right is of so trivial a \\nnature. He supposes it no more \\nessential than whether a man has a \\nright to wear his hat or not; but let me \\nobserve to him that such rights have \\nbeen opposed, and a man has been obliged to pull off his hat when he \\nappeared before the face of authority; \\npeople have also been prevented from \\n 18\\nassembling together on their lawful \\noccasions.  \\nId. (citation omitted). Certainly, the Founders were \\nacutely aware of the potential for abuse by \\nauthorities absent a robust religious liberty \\nprotection that clearly extended to actions, including \\nreligiously motivated expression or non-expression. \\n3. Taken together, the Free Exercise Clause and \\nthe Free Speech Clause elevate the freedom not to \\nspeak out of accordance with firmly held religious beliefs to the highest echelon of First Amendment \\nprotection. This conclusion is buttressed by the First \\nAmendment's other guarantees\\u2014e.g., freedom of \\nassembly and freedom to petition the government. If \\nthe Free Exercise Clause conferred nothing more \\nthan a \\\"right to express religious beliefs,\\\" it would \\n\\\"add nothing to the First Amendment, since that right is fully protected by the right to assemble, \\nspeak, and publish.\\\" Report to the Attorney General, \\nsupra note 2, at 19. Indeed, \\\"because religious \\nexpression is doubly protected by the constitutional \\ntext\\\" it would make little sense if it were \\\"less \\nprotected in practice.\\\" Id. , at 19, n.30. \\nThe examples cited above represent a clear \\nunderstanding by the Founding Generation that civil \\nlaws, even of general applicability, must yield when they conflict with religious expression or the freedom \\nto refrain from expression on the basis of a sincerely \\nheld religious belief. As it seems early legislative \\nbodies believed exemptions in such cases were \\nrequired by the principle of free exercise, it stands to \\nreason that the Framers understood \\\"similar \\napplications of the principle\\\" would guide the courts \\n 19\\nin these cases, once \\\"entrusted with the \\nresponsibility of enforcing\\\" First Amendment \\nguarantees. McConnell, Origins, at 1473. \\nAlthough there was a dearth of litigation over \\nreligious liberty protections in the early years of the \\nRepublic, what scarce examples exist support this \\nview. Consider, for example, the earliest state court \\nopinion addressing the issue of a religious liberty exemption, People v. Phillips . In that case, the court \\nheld that the New York Constitution protected a Catholic priest from compulsory testimony to \\nmatters learned while administering the Sacrament \\nof Confession. See  id., at 1504. \\nImportant to the Phillips court was the notion \\nthat requiring testimony from the priest to \\\"what he \\nreceives in confession, is to declare that there shall \\nbe no penance; and this important branch of the Roman Catholic religion would be thus annihilated.\\\" \\nId. (citation omitted). The court did not believe it was \\ncompatible with religious liberty to compel expression that would so eviscerate a core belief of Catholic faith. Rather than establishing a special \\nprivilege for adherents to the Catholic faith, though, \\nthe court viewed its actions as necessary to ensure \\nCatholics received the same  treatment as Protestants \\n(the dominant faith at the time) in the administration of their sacraments. Id., at 1504-05. \\nThe through line to the Founding Generation's \\nunderstanding of religious liberty was a belief that \\nsuch freedom was without substantive meaning if it did not encompass expression, and non-expression, \\nrooted in religious belief. Noted Nineteenth Century \\n 20\\nConstitutional commentator, Michigan Supreme \\nCourt Justice Thomas Cooley, explained: \\nAn earnest believer usually regards it as his duty to propagate his opinions, \\nand to bring others to his views. To \\ndeprive him of this right is to take from \\nhim the power to perform what he \\nconsiders a most sacred obligation.  \\nT. Cooley, A Treatise on the Constitutional \\nLimitations 665 (7th ed. 1903). Put another way: \\nreligious freedom, as understood by the Founders, \\nnecessarily encompasses the freedom to put belief \\ninto action, to engage in expression consistent with \\nthe dogmas of your faith, and to refrain from \\nexpression that may engender extratemporal consequences. \\nII. T\\nHIS COURT 'S PRECEDENTS \\u2014ESPECIALLY ITS \\nDEMANDING APPLICATION OF THE LEAST -\\nRESTRICTIVE MEANS TEST \\u2014DEMONSTRATE \\nAGREEMENT WITH THE FOUNDING GENERATION 'S \\nROBUST RELIGIOUS LIBERTY PROTECTIONS . \\nThis Court has a commendable history of \\nrecognizing the principles discussed above. In \\nparticular, the Court's recent religious liberty \\njurisprudence has been a welcome reprieve for \\nmembers of all faith communities who have been disheartened by the antagonism of some government \\nactors. See,  e.g., Espinoza v. Mont. Dept of Revenue , \\n140 S. Ct. 2246 (2020); Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. \\nColo. Civil Rights Comm'n , 138 S. Ct. 1719 (2018); \\nHosanna-Tabor , 565 U.S. 171. \\n 21\\nOf particular note is the Court's insistence on a \\nforceful application of the strict scrutiny test to any \\nrestriction that burdens religious liberty. Indeed, \\\"in \\nthis highly sensitive constitutional area, 'only the \\ngravest abuses, endangering paramount interests, \\ngive occasion for permissible limitation.'\\\" Sherbert v. \\nVerner , 374 U.S. 398, 406 (1963) (quoting Thomas v. \\nCollins, 323 U.S. 516, 530 (1945)). \\n1. A few examples illustrate the point. Consider \\nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. , where this \\nCourt considered a government-imposed contraceptive mandate on private employers who \\nbelieved such a requirement to be against their \\nreligious beliefs. 573 U.S. 682, 726 (2014).\\n4 While \\nassuming, without deciding, that the government's \\ninterest was compelling, the Court nonetheless found \\nthat the least-restrictive-means standard was not \\nmet. Id., at 728. Identifying alternative solutions to \\nthe rigid mandate imposed by the government, the Court explained, \\\"[t]he least-restrictive-means \\nstandard is exceptionally demanding.\\\" Id.  As Justice \\nKennedy explained, religious freedom \\\"implicates more than just freedom of belief\\\"; rather \\\"[i]t means, too, the right to express those beliefs and to establish \\none's religious (or nonreligious) self-definition in the \\npolitical, civic, and econ omic life of our larger \\n                                           \\n4 Hobby Lobby  was decided under the Religious Freedom \\nRestoration Act of 1993 (\\\"RFRA\\\"), which requires as an initial \\nmatter finding a substantial government burden on the exercise of religion; if such a burden exists, the Court must determine \\nwhether there is a compelling governmental interest and that \\nthe burden is the least restrictive means of furthering that \\ninterest. Hobby Lobby , 573 U.S., at 694-95. \\n 22\\ncommunity.\\\" Id., at 736\\u201337 (Kennedy, J., \\nconcurring). \\nIn another instance, this Court found Missouri \\nviolated a church's religious  liberty guarantees under \\nthe First Amendment when it categorically denied \\ntheir participation in a grant program for playground \\nsurface materials. Trinity Lutheran Church of \\nColumbia, Inc. v. Comer , 137 S. Ct. 2012, 2017, 2025 \\n(2017). Finding that otherwise eligible grant \\nrecipients were disqualified solely because of their \\nreligious nature, this Court held that such a penalty \\nworked against the free exercise of religion and \\\"triggers the most exacting scrutiny.\\\" Id., at 2021. \\nImportantly, the harm was not the denial of the grant itself but instead was Missouri's refusal to \\neven allow the church to compete with secular \\norganizations for grant funds solely on the basis of \\nits religious identity. Id., at 2022. \\nMore recently still, this Court took up the mantle \\nof religious liberties in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia . \\nDespite the Catholic Church's over two centuries of dedication to serving the needy children of \\nPhiladelphia, the City in 2018 stopped referring foster children to the Catholic Social Services (\\\"CSS\\\") \\nafter learning the organization would not \\\"consider \\nprospective foster parents in same-sex marriages.\\\" \\nFulton , 141 S. Ct., at 1874\\u201375. Finding that \\\"it is \\nplain\\\" the City burdens CSS's \\\"religious exercise by putting it to the choice of  curtailing its mission or \\napproving relationships inconsistent with its beliefs,\\\" this Court sought a review of whether such burden \\nwas \\\"constitutionally permissible.\\\" Id., at 1876. In \\ndetermining that Philadelphia imposed an unconstitutional burden on CSS's religious exercise, \\n 23\\nFulton  admonishes that \\\"so lo ng as the government \\ncan achieve its interests in a manner that does not \\nburden religion, it must do so.\\\" Id., at 1881. \\nTaken together, the precedents of this Court \\nestablish that an exacting analysis is required in \\nreligious liberty cases to determine whether the \\ngovernment's interest is compelling, and its burden \\nnarrowly tailored to achieve that interest. The \\nexistence of an alternative means for achieving even \\na compelling interest is nearly always fatal to the government's argument.  \\n2. When religious liberty and free expression \\nconcerns intertwine, this Court has been even less \\nhesitant to invalidate an infringing law. This \\nskepticism is warranted, as attempts to compel \\nexpression that conflicts with an individual's \\nreligious beliefs are nothing more than indirect \\nattempts to regulate religion itself. \\nIn 1943, this Court took issue with a West \\nVirginia law mandating a flag salute and pledge, when its application was challenged by a group of \\nJehovah's Witnesses who said such action violated \\ntheir religious beliefs. W. Va. State Bd. Of Educ. V. \\nBarnette , 319 U.S. 624 (1943). Refusing to find that \\n\\\"a Bill of Rights which guards the individual's right \\nto speak his own mind, left it open to public \\nauthorities to compel him to utter what is not on his \\nmind,\\\" the Barnette  Court blocked the law's \\nenforcement. Id. , at 634; see also  id., at 645 (Murphy, \\nJ., concurring) (recognizing \\\"[t]he right of freedom of thought and of religion as guaranteed by the \\nConstitution against State action includes both the \\nright to speak freely and the right to refrain from \\n 24\\nspeaking at all\\\"). Underlying the Court's opinion was \\nthe belief that \\\"[i]f there is any fixed star in our \\nconstitutional constellation, it is that no official, high \\nor petty, can prescribe what  shall be orthodox in \\npolitics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act \\ntheir faith therein.\\\" Id., at 642. \\nExpanding on the holding in Barnette , the Court \\nin Wooley v. Maynard  considered a religious \\nobjection to display of the New Hampshire state motto\\u2014\\\"Live Free or Die\\\"\\u2014on the license plate of a \\ncar owned by Jehovah's Witness. 430 U.S. 705 (1977). In Wooley , the Court expressly rejected the \\nidea that \\\"the State may constitutionally require an individual to participate in the dissemination of an \\nideological message by displaying it on his private \\nproperty.\\\" Id., at 713. \\nFoundational to its decision was the Court's \\nholding that the freedoms contained within the First \\nAmendment \\\"includes both the right to speak freely \\nand the right to refrain from speaking at all.\\\" Id., at \\n714. It matters not whether most agree with the message the State seeks to force a person to convey; the First Amendment unquestionably \\\"protects the \\nright of individuals to hold a point of view different \\nfrom the majority and to refu se to foster . . . an idea \\nthey find morally objectionable.\\\" Id. , at 715. Finding \\nthe existence of a governmental burden, the Court \\nwas left to question whether a substantial \\ngovernmental interest existed and, if so, whether the \\nburden was narrowly tailored to advance that \\ninterest. Even assuming a legitimate and substantial interest, the Court concluded \\\"that purpose cannot \\nbe pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental \\n 25\\npersonal liberties when the end can be more \\nnarrowly achieved.\\\" Id., at 716. New Hampshire \\nfailed that test. \\nIn still another line of cases, this Court found \\nthat it violated Constitutional protections to subject religious observants, who went door to door \\ndistributing religious materials and soliciting for the \\npurchase of religious books, to a government \\nsolicitation registration requirement. Murdock v. \\nPennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105 (1943); see also Follett v. \\nTown of McCormick , 321 U.S. 573 (1944). \\nAcknowledging that the practice was derived from the believer's understanding that he was \\\"obeying a \\ncommandment of God,\\\" the Court found that the First Amendment prohibited the imposition of a \\ngenerally applicable registration requirement to \\nengage in such conduct. Murdock , 319 U.S., at 108, \\n117. Indeed, the Court went out of its way to describe the literature being distributed as \\\"provocative, \\nabusive, and ill-mannered.\\\" Id., at 115\\u201316. \\nNevertheless, \\\"[p]lainly  a community may not \\nsuppress . . . the dissemination of views because they \\nare unpopular, annoying or distasteful.\\\" Id.,  at 116 \\nTo allow otherwise would \\\"be a complete repudiation of the philosophy of the Bill of Rights.\\\" Id. \\nThe Court went further still , establishing that the \\nmere fact the religious materials were being \\\"sold\\\" was not enough to transform \\\"evangelism into a \\ncommercial enterprise.\\\" Id., at 111. As such, the \\nCourt acknowledged heightened constitutional protections for \\\"those spreading their religious \\nbeliefs through the spoken and printed word.\\\" Id. As \\ncompared to purely commercial activity, \\\"[f]reedom of \\n 26\\npress, freedom of speech, fr eedom of religion are in a \\npreferred position.\\\" Id., at 115. \\nEven Employment Division v. Smith , often \\ncriticized as having watered down constitutional \\nreligious liberty protections, recognized the Court's \\nunique hostility toward burdens that implicate both \\nthe free exercise of religion and the freedom of \\nspeech. The \\\"First Amendment bars application of a \\nneutral, generally applicable law to religiously \\nmotivated action\\\" when that action \\\"involve[s] not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but the Free \\nExercise Clause in conjunction with other \\nconstitutional protections, such as freedom of \\nspeech.\\\" Empl. Div. v. Smith , 494 U.S. 872, 881\\u201382 \\n(1990). Even some preceden ts, decided on free speech \\ngrounds alone, were undoubtedly reinforced by \\ntouches of freedom-of-religion concerns. Id. \\n3. This much is clear: the arc of this Court's \\nprecedent bends in one incontrovertible direction. \\nScrutiny of any government burden is at its zenith \\nwhen the burden effects an individual's exercise of their religious beliefs in a manner that implicates \\nfree speech protections. This conclusion, rooted in the \\nhistory and tradition of religious exercise as \\nunderstood by the Founders and enshrined in the \\nFirst Amendment, demands that any such burden be \\nsubjected to the most rigorous application of strict \\nscrutiny analysis. \\nIt is precisely for this reason that, to the best of \\nAmicus Curiae's knowledge, the Court has never \\nissued an opinion finding that governmentally \\ncompelled religious speech satisfies strict scrutiny. \\nSee 303 Creative Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Elenis , 6 F.4th \\n 27\\n1160, 1191 (U.S. 10th Cir. 2021) (Tymkovich, C.J., \\ndissenting) (\\\"[T]he majority takes the remarkable\\u2014\\nand novel\\u2014stance that the government may force \\nMs. Smith to produce messages that violate her \\nconscience. . . . No case has ever gone so far.\\\"). \\nThis case should not be the first. \\nIII. THE TENTH CIRCUIT 'S OPINION CANNOT BE \\nSQUARED EITHER WITH THE FIRST \\nAMENDMENT 'S RICH HISTORY OR THIS COURT 'S \\nPROTECTION OF BELIEVERS ' FREE SPEECH \\nRIGHTS . \\nIn its permissive application of strict scrutiny, the \\nTenth Circuit bastardized this Court's protection of free speech rights, especially as applied to religious \\nexpression. If allowed to stand, its precedent will give license to courts across this Country to \\nhumiliate members of all religious sects by \\ncompelling them to speak in contravention of their \\nsincerely held religious beliefs. By purporting to \\napply strict scrutiny, the Tenth Circuit's opinion \\ncheapened the First Amendment rights of Catholics, \\nProtestants, Muslims, Jews, and all other believers alike. \\nLuckily, this precedent d oes not need to stand. \\nThis Court, once again, has an opportunity to \\nadmonish that the free speech protections of \\nbelievers are no less than non-believers and, in fact, \\nare heightened when faced with government \\nregulation that would compel speech antithetical to the tenants of a believer's faith. The First \\nAmendment commands such a result. \\n 28\\nAlthough the Tenth Circuit rightly concluded that \\nMs. Smith's website designs are \\\"pure speech,\\\" 303 \\nCreative LLC, 6 F.4th, at 1176, the Tenth Circuit \\nwrongly concludes that the commercial nature of Ms. \\nSmith's speech gives Colorado a regulatory hook to \\nlatch onto. Id., at 1179. By failing to acknowledge the \\nreligious nature of her objection to the would-be compelled speech, the Tenth Circuit did not afford \\nher First Amendment rights the \\\"preferred\\\" status \\nthey deserve.\\n5 Cf., Murdock , 319 U.S., at 115. What \\nis remarkable is that the religious nature of Ms. Smith's objection is not disputed. See 303 \\nCreative, 6 F. 4th, at 1172 (Ms. Smith is \\\"willing to create custom graphics and websites for gay, lesbian, \\nor bisexual clients . . . so long as the custom graphics \\nand websites do not violate [her] religious beliefs, as is true for all customers.\\\" (internal quotation marks \\nomitted)); id., at 1192 (Tymkovich, C.J., dissenting) \\n(\\\"In short, Colorado appear s to agree that Ms. Smith \\ndoes not distinguish between customers based on \\nprotected-class status and thus advances the aims of \\nCADA. But when any customer asks Ms. Smith to \\ncreate expressive content that violates her sincerely \\nheld beliefs, she will decline the request.\\\"). \\n                                           \\n5 Remarkably, the Tenth Circuit  suggests that its sweeping \\nholding may not apply to \\\"all artists\\\" if they were not engaged \\nin \\\"commercial activity,\\\" but rather \\\"commissioning a mural for some charitable purpose.\\\" 303 Creative , 6 F.4th, at 1182, n.6. To \\nsuggest that a local artist wh o refuses to paint a Christian \\nmural for a church may enjoy more constitutional protections \\nthan a woman called to live out her sincerely held religious \\nbeliefs by creating custom wedding websites is, thankfully, not supported by the history or tradition of the First Amendment \\nand the muscular protections it affords religious believers. \\n 29\\nThis failure is compounded by the Tenth Circuit's \\nfallacy of a marketplace of one for Ms. Smith's \\nspeech. Id. at 1180. Such convenient analysis \\nallowed the court to conclude \\\"there are no less intrusive means of providing equal access to those  \\ntypes of services.\\\" Id. (emphasis added). But this \\nclever reasoning flips this Court's precedent on its \\nhead. Rather than prioritize the religious speaker's \\nobjection in search of a less restrictive means, the \\ncourt below merely concluded that she is the only one and therefore no other means will suffice. But, \\nwhere, as here, the government can achieve its interests without burdening religion, the \\nConstitution requires it to do so. Fulton , 141 S. Ct., \\nat 1881. The analysis is also anomalous in the free speech context because it cannot be that the more \\nunique and distinctive the speech, the less  First \\nAmendment protection it deserves. But that is the staggering breadth of the Tenth Circuit majority's \\nconclusion. See 303 Creative , 6 F.4th, at 1204-05 \\n(Tymkovich, C.J., dissenting).  \\nMoreover, by categorizing Ms. Smith as nothing \\nmore than a \\\"public accommodation,\\\" the Tenth \\nCircuit minimized her right to participate in the \\nmarketplace, even as a woman of faith. See 303 \\nCreative, 6 F.4th, at 1181 (\\\"[W]hether an exception limits market access depends upon the uniqueness of \\nthe public accommodation's goods and services\\u2014not \\nthe sincerity of the public accommodation's beliefs.\\\"). \\nTo deny a benefit to those \\\"who engage in certain \\nforms of speech is in effect to penalize them for such \\nspeech,\\\" and constitutionally, no different than \\nconditioning a benefit on a person's \\\"willingness to \\nviolate a cardinal principle of her religious faith;\\\" the \\n 30\\nresult is the same: to \\\"deter[] or discourage[] the \\nexercise of First Amendment rights of expression.\\\" \\nSherbert , 374 U.S., at 405-06 (citing Speiser v. \\nRandall, 357 U.S. 513, 518 (1958)). Here too, Colorado seeks to impose the same constitutional \\nharm: speak in violation of your core religious faith \\nor lose the benefit of marketplace participation. Put \\nsimply, Colorado seeks to punish Ms. Smith for her \\nsincerely held religious beliefs. See also Trinity \\nLutheran Church , 137 S. Ct., at 2021\\u201322 (finding a \\nconstitutional violation where a burden puts \\nreligious believers \\\"to a choice: [] participate in an \\notherwise available benefit\\\" or maintain your \\nreligious identity). \\nThe same fundamental principle must apply to \\nfree speech and religious practices when they act in concert: \\\"In an open, pluralistic, self-governing \\nsociety, the expression of an idea cannot be \\nsuppressed simply because some find it offensive, \\ninsulting, or even wounding.\\\" Fulton , 141 S. Ct., at \\n1924-25 (Alito, J., concurring). To lose this principle is to lose the \\\"preservation of religious freedom.\\\" Id., \\nat 1925. That is because \\\"[s]uppressing speech\\u2014or \\nreligious practice\\u2014simply because it expresses an idea that some find hurtful is a zero-sum game.\\\" Id. \\nThis Court's jurisprudence confirms this link \\nbetween religious exercise and free speech because \\nthis Court's opinions \\\"make it perfectly clear that \\ndiscrimination against religious, as opposed to \\nsecular, expression is viewpoint discrimination.\\\" \\nNurre v. Whitehead , 559 U.S. 1025, 1028 (2010) \\n(Alito, J., dissenting). And because viewpoint discrimination is \\\"an egregious form of content \\ndiscrimination,\\\" Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of \\n 31\\nthe Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995), it brings \\nwith it heightened constitutional skepticism. \\nAlthough some may find Ms. Smith's religious \\nbeliefs objectionable, \\\"religions, and those who \\nadhere to religious doctrines, may continue to \\nadvocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by \\ndivine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be \\ncondoned.\\\" Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U.S. 644, 679 \\n(2015). \\\"An open society can keep that promise while still respecting the 'dignity,' 'worth,' and fundamental equality of all members of the \\ncommunity.\\\" Fulton , 141 S. Ct., at 1925 (Alito, J., \\nconcurring) (quoting Masterpiece Cakeshop , 138 S. \\nCt., at 1727). Ms. Smith should be free to practice all \\naspects of her faith, without fear of government-\\ncompelled expression against her sincerely held \\nreligious beliefs. The Constitution demands no less.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_args\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

      "[{'I. The any-qualified-provider provision does not create individual rights enforceable under 42 U.S.C.  1983': 'Private individuals seeking to enforce Spending \\nClause legislation through an action under 42 U.S.C. \\n1983 face a demanding bar:  Congress must have unam-\\nbiguously conferred individual federal rights in the stat-\\nute.  Gonzaga Univ.  v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 280 (2002).  That  \\n\"stringent standard\" will be satisfied only in the \"atyp-\\nical case.\"  Health & Hosp . Corp. of Marion County v. \\nTalevski , 599 U.S. 166, 183, 186 (2023).  This case is not \\natypical.  The Medicaid statute\\'s any -qualified -provider \\nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A),  is buried in a long, \\nundifferentiated list of requirements for state Medicaid \\nplans , and its text lacks \"explicit rights -creating\" lan-\\nguage .  Gonzaga , 536 U.S. at 284. \\n16'}, {'A. Spending Clause statutes must unambiguously confer individual rights to be privately enforceable under Section 1983': '1. Sect ion 1983  creates a private cause of action \\nagainst any person who, under color of state law, de-\\nprives another \"of any rights , privileges, or immunities \\nsecured by the Constitution and laws.\"  42 U.S.C. 1983 .  \\nSection 1983 thus authorizes suits against state actors \\nwho violate \"rights\" created by federal laws .  See Maine  \\nv. Thibo utot, 448 U.S. 1, 4 (1980).  Not every violation of \\na federal statute constitutes a deprivation of  \"rights\" \\nunder  Section 1983.   See Gonzaga , 536 U.S. at 283.  In-\\nstead, private plaintiffs cannot enforce a federal statute \\nunder Section 1983 unless  the statute unmistakably  \\n\"confer [s] individual rights upon a class of beneficiar-\\nies.\"  Id. at 285.   Even then,  Section 1983 enforcement \\nmay be unavailable, if Congress signaled expressly or \\nimplicitly that it displace d the Section 1983 remedy with \\nothers .  See City of Rancho Palos Verdes  v. Abrams , \\n544 U.S. 113, 120 ( 2005).  \\nLegislation  enacted  under the  Spending Clause, U.S. \\nConst. Art. I, § 8, Cl. 1 , is particularly u nlikely to confer  \\nenforceable individual rights .  The \"typical remedy for \\nstate noncompliance with\" conditions imposed in Spend-\\ning Clause legislation \"is not a private cause of action \\nfor noncompliance but rather action by the Federal Gov-\\nernment to terminate funds to the State.\"  Pennhurst \\nState Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman , 451 U .S. 1, 28 (1981).   \\nUnless Congress \" \\u200a\\'speak [s] with a clear voice \\'\\u200a\" and \\n\"manifests  an \\'unambiguous \\' intent to confer individual \\nrights,\" a Spending Clause statute is not  privately en-\\nforceable under Section 1983.  Gonzaga , 536 U.S. at 280 \\n(quoting Pennhurst , 451 U.S. at 17, 28, & n.21) ( empha-\\nsis added ). \\n17 \\n 2. That rigorous standard harks to similar ly strin-\\ngent rules in related contexts.  Courts do not  interpret \\nstatutes to abrogate States\\' sovereign immunity unless \\nCongress makes \"its intention unmistakably clear in the \\nlanguage of the statute.\"  Dellmuth  v. Muth , 491 U.S. \\n223, 228 (1989) (citation omitted) .  And only \"explicit \\n\\'right - or duty -creating language \\'\\u200a\" suffices to show that \\nCongress created a private right of action.  Gonzaga , \\n536 U.S. at 284 n.3 (citing Alexander  v. Sandoval , 532 \\nU.S. 275, 288 (2001)).  Those rules are rarely satisfied . \\nThe same is true  here , not least because reading Spend-\\ning Clause legislation to create rights privately enforce-\\nable via Section 1983 can raise  similar concerns.   \\nStart with federalism considerations.  This Court has \\nrequired Congress to speak clearly when its legislation \\ndisrupts the usual federal -State balance of power.  See \\nGregory  v. Ashcroft , 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991).  In Spend-\\ning Clause programs like Medicaid, that balance is care-\\nfully tailored:  the federal government establishes con-\\nditions for funding, but within those parameters, States \\ngenerally have latitude to develop their own programs.  \\nSee Alexander  v. Choate , 469 U.S. 287, 303 (1985).  In-\\ndeed, Spendin g Clause legislation operates \"much in \\nthe nature of a contract.\"  Pennhurst , 451 U.S. at 17.  \\nThe \"legitimacy\" of the federal -State bargain \"rests on \\nwhether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts \\nthe terms of the \\'contract.\\' \\u200a\"  Ibid.   A State cannot know-\\ningly accept those terms if it \"is unaware of the condi-\\ntions or is unable to ascertain what is expected of it.\"  \\nIbid.   Congress is thus expected to \"speak with a clear \\nvoice\" before imposing a condition on federal funding.  \\nIbid.   The same degree of clarity is called for  when the \\nfunding condition  involves a grant of  individual rights \\n18 \\n that could expose States to private  enforcement suits \\nunder Section 1983.    \\nRequiring  an unambiguous conferral of individual \\nrights also alleviates potential \"separation -of-powers \\nconcerns.\"  Gonzaga , 536 U.S. at 286.  Congress, not the \\njudicial branch , has \"primacy\" over creating causes of \\nactio n, and courts transgress that line by finding judi-\\ncially enforceable rights where Congress leaves  some \\ndoubt that it intended to create them.  Talevski , 599 U.S.  \\nat 183.  The rigorous standard of \"unambiguous confer-\\nral\" also safeguards the Executive\\'s role as the primary \\nenforcer of state c ompliance with federal funding condi-\\ntions.  See ibid.   If Congress intends the Executive to \\nshare that enforcement with potentially millions of ben-\\neficiaries, Congress  can be expected to say so clearly.  \\n3. Earlier decisions of this Court appeared to  \"sug-\\ngest that something less than an unambiguously con-\\nferred right\"  could still render  Spending Clause provi-\\nsions enforceable  under Section 1983.  Gonzaga , 536 U.S.  \\nat 282.  In Wilder  v. Virginia Hospital Ass\\'n , 496 U.S. \\n498 (1990), the Court reasoned  that Spending Clause \\nlegislation could be  enforceable under Section 1983 as \\nlong as  the provision was \"intend[ed] to benefit the pu-\\ntative plaintiff \\u200a\" and the plaintiff \\u200a\\'s asserted interest in \\nthe statute was not \"too vague and amorphous\" for \\ncourts to enforce.   Id. at 509  (citations omitted) .  The \\nCourt\\'s analysis in  Blessing  v. Freestone , 520 U.S. 329 \\n(1997), also led so me courts to permit  private plaintiffs \\nto enforce federal statutes  under Section 1983  \"so long \\nas the plaintiff falls within the general zone of interest \\nthat the statute is intended to protect.\"  Gonzaga , 536 \\nU.S. at 283.  \\nBut in  Gonzaga , the Court \"repudiate[d] the ready \\nimplication of a § 1983  action that Wilder \" and other \\n19 \\n early cases exemplified.  Armstrong  v. Exceptional Child  \\nCenter, Inc. , 575 U.S. 320, 330 n. (2015).  Gonzaga  held  \\nthat nothing \"short of an unambiguously conferred \\nright \" could  \"support a cause of action brought under  \\n§ 1983 .\"  536 U.S. at 283.   Only when the statutory  \"text \\nand structure \" unambiguously contain  \"explicit rights -\\ncreating \" language and an \"individual\"  focus  can federal \\nstatutes conceivably create Section 1983 -enforceable \\nrights .  Id. at 284, 286.  Policy -focused language —like a \\nprovision that  \"[n]o funds shall be made available \" to \\n\"any educational agency or institution which has a pol-\\nicy or practice of permitting the release  of [students\\'] \\neducation records\" without parents\\' written consent —\\nfails that bar .  Id. at 279 (quoting 20 U.S.C.  1232g(b)(1) ). \\nEven after Gonzaga  was decided in 2002 , courts of \\nappeals continued to mix statutory analysis of a partic-\\nular provision with  a more freewheeling inquiry into \\nquestions like whether Congress \"intended that the \\nprovision in question benefit the plaintiff .\"  Planned \\nParenthood Arizona Inc.  v. Betlach , 727 F.3d 960, 966 \\n(9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Blessing , 520 U.S. at 341) , cert. \\ndenied, 571 U.S. 1198 (2014) .  This Court i n Talevski  put \\na stop to  that approach, instructing that Gonzaga  alone \\n\"sets the standard for determining when a Spending \\nClause statute confers individual rights.\"  599 U.S. at \\n193 (Barrett,  J., concurring).  Talevski emphasized how \\n\"stringent\" that standard is, and how infrequently it \\nwill be met.  Id. at 186 (majority opinion) .  Only in the \\n\"atypical case\" will Spending Clause legislation clear \\nthe \"significant hurdle\"  of an unambiguous conferral of \\nindividual rights.   Id. at 183 -184.  Thus , \"§ 1983 actions \\nare the exception —not the rule —for violations of \\nSpending Clause statutes.\"  Id. at 193 -194 (Barrett, J., \\nconcurring).    \\n20'}, {'B. The any-qualified-provider provision does not unambiguously confer individual federal rights': '1. This Court\\'s cases illustrate the hallmarks of un-\\nusual, rights -conferring provisions versus features that \\ndo not suffice .   \\nOn one end of the spectrum, Talevski  exemplifies the \\n\"atypical case\" where Congress clearly and unambigu-\\nously created individual -focused rights enforceable un-\\nder Section 1983 .  599 U.S. at 183.  Again, Talevski  in-\\nvolved two provisions of a statute governing nursing \\nhomes that Congress appended to the federal Medicaid \\nstatute.  One required nursing homes to \"protect and pro-\\nmote\" residents\\' \"right to be free from\" certain \"physi-\\ncal or chemical restraints.\"  42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii).  \\nThe second provided that nursing homes \"must not \\ntransfer or discharge [a] resident\" unless certain pre-\\nconditions were satisfied.  42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(2)(A)  and \\n(B).  To parse those provisions, this Court began with \\ntheir \"place in the overall statutory scheme .\"  Talevski , \\n599 U.S. at 184.   Both provisions were housed in a sub-\\nsection of the statute tit led \"Requirements relating to \\nresidents\\' rights .\"  Id. at 184-185 (citation s omitted) .  Ze-\\nroing  in on the provisions\\' text, the Court observed that \\nthey made multiple  references to an individual benefi-\\nciary (the \"resident\"), and several express references  \\nto \"rights.\"  Ibid.  The Court held that the combined ef-\\nfect of the text and structure \"inexorably\" recognized \\nindividual rights enforceable under Section 1983 .  Id. at \\n192.  Even then, the Court considered whether other \\nstatutory features rebutted that unambiguous rights -\\ncreating language  by suggesting that Congress  had \\nruled  out Section 1983 remedies.  Id. at 186 -191.   \\nMany other types of provisions fall short .  Consider \\nthe provision in Gonzaga :  \"No funds shall be made \\n21 \\n available under any applicable program to any educa-\\ntional agency or institution which has a policy or prac-\\ntice of permitting the release of [students\\'] education \\nrecords       without the written consent of their par-\\nents.\"  20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1).  That nondisclosure provi-\\nsion include s no \"\\u200a\\'rights -creating \\' language ,\" \"speak[s] \\nonly to the Secretary of Education,\" and concerns only \\nwhether entities have a generalized policy that would \\ndisqualify them from funding .  Gonzaga , 536 U.S. at  \\n287-288 (citation omitted) .  Further, institutions needed \\nto comply only \"substantially\" to avoid termination of \\nfunding.  Id. at 288.  The absence of any mention of \\n\"rights,\" the provision\\'s focus on the Secretary rather \\nthan individuals, and its placement in a substantial -\\ncompliance  regime all foreclosed Section 1983 enforce-\\nment . \\nOr take the Medicaid provision in Armstrong , 42 \\nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(30)(A) , which require s state plans to \\n\"provide such methods and procedures \" as necessary to \\nassure that \"care and services are available under the \\nplan at least to the extent    available to the general \\npopulation in the geographic area.\"  In a footnote, Arm-\\nstrong  explained that the medical -provider plaintiffs  \\nhad not tried to bring a suit under Section 1983 , even \\nthough Wilder  had found a privately enforceable right \\nfor a nearby Medicaid provision  requiring state plans to \\nprovide \"for payment\" of certain services through \"rea-\\nsonable and adequate \" reimbursement rates.   575 U.S . \\nat 33 0 n.; 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(13)(A) (1982).4  The Court \\napproved of that strategic decision \"since our later opin-\\nions plainly repudiate the ready implication of a § 1983 \\naction that Wilder  exemplified.\"  575 U.S. at 33 0 n..   \\n \\n4  The provision in Wilder  has since been repealed.  See Balanced \\nBudget Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 105 -33, § 4711, 111 Stat. 507 -508. \\n22 \\n 2. Applying th ose precedents , the any -qualified -\\nprovider provision of the Medicaid statute , 42 U.S.C. \\n1396a(a)(23)(A)  cannot surmount  the \"demanding bar\"  \\nfor unmistakably clear , rights -conferring language.   \\nTalevski , 599 U.S. at 180.  The statutory \"text and struc-\\nture\" do not reveal the requisite  unambiguous conferral  \\nof individual rights .  Gonzaga , 536 U.S. at 286.   \\n a. The Court in Talevski  began by focusing on the \\nFNHRA provisions\\'  \"place in the overall statutory \\nscheme.\"  599 U.S. at 184 (citation omitted).  The Court \\nobserved that the provisions were set off from the rest \\nof the statute in a subsection expressly titled \"Require-\\nments relating to residents\\' rights .\"  Ibid.  (quoting 42 \\nU.S.C. 1396r(c)).  That  distinctive place in the statute  \\nwas, at the outset , \"indicative of an individual rights -\\ncreating focus.\"  Ibid.  (citation omitted).   \\nBeginning in the same place here, the any-qualified -\\nprovider provision lacks any special, distinctive place  \\nin Section 1396a(a).  The any -qualified -provider provi-\\nsion is housed in 42 U.S.C. 1396a, a section titled \"State \\nplans  for medical assistance.\"  Subsection (a) of that \\nstatute, titled \"Contents,\" includes 87 paragraphs of re-\\nquirements for state Medicaid plans, of which the any -\\nqualified -provider provision is number 23.  See 42 \\nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(1) -(87).  Those paragraphs ar e not ar-\\nranged in any discernible order, let alone  under  sub-\\nheadings that mention \"rights.\"  See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a).   \\nMany of the surrounding 86 paragraphs in 42 U.S.C. \\n1396a(a) lack even arguably rights -conferring  language .  \\nFor example, paragraph  (a)(58) requires state plans to \\nprovide for the development of a certain \"written de-\\nscription of the law of the State .\"  42 U.S.C. \\n1396 a(a)(58).  And paragraph (a)(6) requires state plans \\nto \"provide that the State [Medicaid] agency will make \\n23 \\n such reports, in such form and containing such infor-\\nmation, as the Secretary may from time to time re-\\nquire.\"  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(6).  That is simply a report-\\ning requirement —a generalized \" \\u200a\\'policy or practice\\' \\u200a\" of \\nthe sort this Court held does not confer individual \\nrights.  Gonzaga , 536 U.S. at 288 -289.  Section 1396a(a) \\nincludes many other similarly generalized policies.5  \\nSome  were added in the same amendments as the any -\\nqualified -provider provision.  See , e.g., Social Security \\nAmendments of 1967, Pub. L. No. 90 -248, § § 227-229, 81 \\nStat. 903 -905.  Paragraph  (a)(24), for example, requires \\nstate plans to \"provide for consultative services by \\nhealth agencies\" to \"hospitals, nursing homes,\" and \\nother institutions.  § 228(a)(3), 81 Stat. 904 (codified as \\namended at 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(24) ). \\nIt is not apparent  why Congress would have buried \\na rights -conferring provision deep within  a long list rid-\\ndled with  generalized policies.  If Congress intended to \\nsingle out the any -qualified -provider provision as the \\n\"atypical case,\" one would expect the statutory struc-\\nture to reflect that choice, as in Talevski . \\nb. Section 1396a(a)(23)\\'s place in the broader Medi-\\ncaid statute reinforces its lack of special, Section 1983 -\\nenforceable features .  This Court has already observed \\nthat provisions in a substantial -compliance regime for \\nStates are less likely to trigger Section 1983.  Gonzaga , \\n536 U.S. at 288.   A substantial -compliance regime tends \\nto indicate  a focus  on the \"aggregate practices \" of the \\n \\n5  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(1) ( State plan must \"provide that\" \\nit \"shall be in effect in all political subdivisions of the State\"); 42 \\nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(59) (State must \"maintain a list\" of \"all physicians \\nwho are certified to participate under the State plan\"); 42 U.S.C. \\n1396a(a)(7 1) (State  plan must  \"provide that the State will implement \\nan asset verification program \"). \\n24 \\n funding recipient , not \"whether the needs of any partic-\\nular person have been satisfied.\"  Does v. Gillespie , 867 \\nF.3d 1034, 104 2 (8th Cir. 2017)  (citation omitted); Gon-\\nzaga , 536 U.S. at 288 (citation omitted).   \\nThe Medicaid statute is a case in point:  a State need \\nonly \"comply substantially\" with Section 1396a(a)  re-\\nquirements  to continue receiving federal  funding.  42 \\nU.S.C. 1396c(2).   Congress has even authorized the Sec-\\nretary to waive entirely States \\' compliance with Section \\n1396a(a) requirements  under certain circumstances.   \\nE.g., 42 U.S.C. 1315(a)(1) (authorizing waivers for States  \\nto conduct pilot project s).  As in Gonzaga , the fact that \\nCongress tied federal funding to substantial compliance  \\nwith Section 1396a(a)(23) and its brethren —and permit-\\nted States  not to comply at all if the Secretary grants  \\na waiver —undercuts the inference that Section \\n1396a( a)(23) unambiguously secures individual rights.   \\nc. In Talevski , the Court then evaluated the text  \\nof the at -issue provisions alongside their place in the \\nstatutory scheme.  See 599 U.S. at 185.  There , the re-\\ncurrent references to \"rights\" in various levels of  \\nsubprovisions —and to \" residents \" in the specific provi-\\nsions —showed that Congress was unmistakably confer-\\nring Section 1983 -enforceable rights.  That same ap-\\nproach yields the opposite inference  here :  Section \\n1396a(a)(23)\\'s text, read in context, does not confer in-\\ndividual rights with the requisite clarity.  \\nFirst, Section 1396a(a)(23)  lacks \"explicit rights -\\ncreating\" language.  Gonzaga , 536 U.S. at 284.  Again, \\nthe nursing -home provisions in Talevski  were replete \\nwith references to \"rights\":  nursing homes were  \\nrequired  to protect \"the right  to be free from\" certain \\nrestraints, and the provisions were  nestled within sub-\\nheadings concerning \"requirements relating to \\n25 \\n residents\\' rights \" and \"transfer and discharge rights .\"  \\n599 U.S. at 184 -185 (brackets and citations omitted).  \\nBut Section 1396a(a)(23)\\'s any -qualified -provider provi-\\nsion never mentions \"rights,\" let alone repeatedly.  \\nWhile \"rights\" is not a magic word, the dearth of even \\nsynonyms for \"rights\" in Section 1396a(a)(23) makes it \\nharder to read the provision to unambiguously confer \\nthem .  \\nThe closest that Section 1396a(a)(23) comes is the \\nphrase \"may obtain \":  state plans must provide that an \\neligible individual \" may obtain \" care from \"any institu-\\ntion,\" \"qualified to perform the service\" required, \"who \\nundertakes to provide him such services .\"  42 U.S.C. \\n1396a(a)(23)(A)  (emphasis added); s ee Br. in Opp. 25.  In \\nisolation, that phrase could  be read as a freestanding \\nguarantee that beneficiaries \"may obtain\" medical care \\nfrom their choice of qualified provider .  But other parts \\nof the text undercut that reading . \\nSection 1396a(a)(23)  lacks an \"unmistakable focus on \\nthe benefited class.\"   Talevski , 599 U.S. at 186 (citation \\nomitted).   In Talevski , the nursing -home provisions at \\nissue, found in Section  1396r, were not directives to \\nStates about what to include in plans or instructions to \\nthe Secretary about preconditions State plans had to \\nmeet to obtain approval.  Those provisions instead de-\\nscribed \"rights\" for individual nursing -home patients \\nthrougho ut.  Here, however, while Section 1396a(a)(23) \\nmentions \"individua l[s]\" who benefit from the federal -\\nState bargain to furnish medical care, individual bene-\\nficiaries are not the focus in the same way.  Read as a \\nwhole, Section 1396a(a)(23) is directed to two other ac-\\ntors:  the States and the Secretary .   \\nAs to the States, all of Section 1396a(a) instructs \\nStates what the required \"Contents\" of their state plans \\n26 \\n must be.  Language in Section 1396a(a)(23)  shifts the \\nfocus to States further, granting them the authority to \\ndecline to provide payments to certain  providers \"con-\\nvicted of a felony\"  and to \"determine[]\"  which felony \\nconvictions  should qualify.  See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23) .   \\nMeanwhile, Section 1396a is ultimately directed to \\nthe Secretary  of HHS, since the provision\\'s reticulated \\nprescriptions for plans tell the Secretary what to look \\nfor before approving a State plan .  See 42 U.S.C. \\n1396a(b)) (\" The Secretary shall approve any plan which  \\nfulfills the conditions specified in subsection (a).\") ; see \\nGillespie , 867 F.3d at 1041 .  That feature of the statute \\nled a  plurality of this Court in Armstrong to conclude \\nthat a nearby  provision , 42 U.S.C. 1396a (a)(30)(A), \"is \\nphrased as a directive to the federal agency charged \\nwith approving state Medicaid plans, not as a conferral \\nof the right to sue upon the beneficiaries.\"  575 U.S.  \\nat 331  (plurality opinion) .  In sum, t he any -qualified -\\nprovider provision  \"serve[s] primarily to direct the Fed-\\neral Government\\'s distribution of public funds.\"  Talev-\\nski, 599 U.S. at 183 -184 (brackets and citation omitted).  \\nCongress could have taken another approach .  As \\nTalevski  illustrates, even within the Medicaid frame-\\nwork, Congress knows how to create individual rights .  \\nThe FNHRA is part of the Medicaid statute, and state \\nplans must provide for compliance with its provisions   \\nto be approved by the Secretary.  See 42 U.S.C. \\n1396a(a)(28)(A).   But Congress did not purport to confer \\nindividual rights through that state -plan requirement. \\nInstead, Congress created a separate, separately subti-\\ntled provision focused expressly on  rights , see Talevski , \\n599 U.S. at 18 4, and cross -referenced that section in the \\nstate -plan requirements for purposes of the Secretary\\'s \\nevaluation of plan compliance .  Had Congress wanted to \\n27 \\n create similarly enforceable individual rights to choose \\nany qualified provider, Congress could have taken the \\nsame tack .'}, {'C. Finding a privately enforceable individual right in this case would create line-drawing problems': 'If Section 1396a(a)(23) creates privately enforceable \\nrights, many analogous provisions sprinkled through-\\nout the Medicaid statute and similar  federal benefits \\nprograms presumptively might as well .  Far from being \\n\"atypical\" exceptions, rights -creating provisions could \\nswallow the \"rule,\" contravening this Court\\'s admoni-\\ntions in Talevski , 599 U.S. at 183 ; id. at 193 (Barrett, J., \\nconcurring).  Other Spending Clause statutes likewise \\ninclude state -plan requirements that refer to \"individu-\\nals\" and their benefi ts.  But respondents offer no prin-\\ncipled way to draw lines between which of those provi-\\nsions confer individual rights and which do not.  That \\nrespondents\\' theory could potentially make many other \\nSpending Clause provisions privately enforceable is an \\nadditional reason to reject it, given Talevski \\'s directive \\nthat Section 1983 enforcement of Spending Clause leg-\\nislation is meant to be atypical . \\nScattered among the generalized state -plan policies \\nin Section 1396a are several other provisions that, like \\nSection 1396a(a)(23)\\'s any -qualified -provider provision, \\nrefer to \"individual\" beneficiaries .  For example,  para-\\ngraph (a)(12) requires Medicaid plans to \"provide that, \\nin determining whether an individual is blind, there \\nshall be an examination by a physician skilled in the dis-\\neases of the eye or by an optometrist, whichever the in-\\ndividual may select.\"  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a) (12).  Like  the \\nany-qualified -provider provision, paragraph (a)(12) ref-\\nerences an \"individual\" and suggests that the plan must \\nprovide that he \" may  select\" the eye specialist of his \\n28 \\n choice.  If the words \"individual\" and \"may\" suffice  to \\nunambiguously confer Section 1983 -enforceable  rights \\nin paragraph  (a)(23)\\'s any -qualified -provider provision , \\nthen presumably they would  unambiguously confer \\nrights in  paragraph  (a)(12), too. \\nOther provisions with similar phrasing  crop up \\namidst  Section 1396a (a)\\'s 87 paragraphs  in no discerni-\\nble order .  See pp. 22-23, supra .  Take paragraph (a)(3) , \\nwhich  requires state plans to \"provide for granting an \\nopportunity for a fair hearing before the State agency \\nto any individual whose claim for medical assistance un-\\nder the plan is denied or not acted upon with reasonable \\npromptness.\"  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(3).  Or paragraph  \\n(a)(26):  state plans must  provide , \"with respect to each \\npatient receiving\" certain services,  for \"a written plan \\nof care.\"  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)( 26).  Or consider  paragraph  \\n(a)(53):  state plans are to  provide \"for notifying in a \\ntimely manner all [eligible] individuals \" of \"the availa-\\nbility of benefits furnished by the special supplemental \\nnutrition program.\"   42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(53).    \\nOther examples include paragraph (a)(32), which re-\\nquires States to provide that \"no payment \" for care \\n\"provided to an individual shall be made to anyone other \\nthan such individual,\" or paragraph (a)(84), which re-\\nquires state plans  to provide that they will not termi-\\nnate coverage \"for an individual who is an eligible juve-\\nnile\" because he is \"an inmate of a public institution .\"  \\n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(32) ; 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(84) (2018 ); \\nsee Pet. Br. 37 -40.   \\nUnder respondents\\' theory, these provisions would \\nalso trigger Section 1983.  And the line -drawing difficul-\\nties these provisions present under that approach are \\nalready apparent.  Lower courts  have found some of \\nthose provisions to be rights -conferring, but others not \\n29 \\n to be .  See, e.g., Shakhnes  v. Berlin , 689 F.3d 244, 247 \\n(2d Cir. 2012)  (finding a privately enforceable right in \\nparagraph  (a)(3)) , cert. denied, 569 U.S. 918 (2013) ; \\nAliser  v. SEIU California , 419 F. Supp. 3d 1161, 1168 \\n(N.D. Cal. 2019) (holding that paragraph (a)(32) \"does \\nnot create an individually enforceable right\") .   \\nTreating Section 1396a(a)(23) as a Section 1983 - \\nenforceable provision would open the door for similar \\nprovisions —and the attendant line -drawing problems —\\nin other Spending Clause statutes.  The Food and Nu-\\ntrition  Act of 2008 , 7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq. , includes a long \\nlist of state -plan requirements  mention ing individual \\n\"households ,\" including  that the State shall \"promptly \\ndetermine the eligibility of each applicant household\"  \\nfor supplemental nutrition assistance benefits .  7 U.S.C. \\n2020(e)(3); see Briggs v. Bremby , 792 F.3d 239 (2d Cir. \\n2015) (finding Section 1983 -enforceable right ).  The fed-\\neral adoption -assistance statute requires state plans to , \\namong other things,  provide  for a \"fair hearing\" to \"any \\nindividual\" whose claim for benefits is denied or not \\nacted upon with \"reasonable promptness.\"   42 U.S.C. \\n671(a)(12); see ASW  v. Oregon , 424 F.3d 970 , 978 (9th \\nCir. 2005)  (finding Section 1983 -enforceable right ), cert. \\ndenied, 549 U.S. 812 (2006) .  And o ther b enefits statutes \\nrequire state plans  to provide that assistance \"shall be \\nfurnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible in-\\ndividuals .\"  E.g., 42 U.S.C. 302(a)(8), 1202(a)(11).  Those \\nprovisions also mention individual beneficiaries and \\nspecific benefits.  Respondents\\' theory offers no way to \\ndistinguish between these provisions.  And t hose broad \\nconsequences for  analogous provisions suggest that \\nSection 1396a(a)(23) cannot qualify as the \"atypical \\ncase\" of a privately enforceable Spending Clause provi-\\nsion.  See Talevski , 599 U.S. at 183.   \\n30'}, {'D. Other enforcement mechanisms protect beneficiaries': 'Just because Section 1396a(a)(23) is not privately en-\\nforceable does not leave beneficiaries without protec-\\ntion.  Alternative enforcement mechanisms protect in-\\ndividual beneficiaries\\' interests, both with respect to \\nthe any -qualified -provider provision and other similarly \\nworded state -plan provisions.  If anything, those mech-\\nanisms cut further against the notion tha t Congress un-\\nmistakably designated Section 1396a(a)(23) as a trigger \\nfor Section 1983 suits.   The existence of an alternative \\n\"mechanism that Cong ress chose to provide for enforc-\\ning\" certain provisions \"buttress e[s]\" the \"conclusion \\nthat [those ] provisions fail to confer enforceable rights.\"  \\nGonzaga , 536 U.S. at 289.  \\nThe primary enforcement mechanism for Spending \\nClause legislation is the termination of federal funding.  \\nTalevski , 599 U.S. at 183; see 42 U.S.C. 1396c(2).  In ad-\\ndition, t he Secretary has rejected plan amendments \\nthat fail to satisfy the any -qualified -provider provision \\nand leave individual beneficiaries with insufficient \\nchoice among qualified providers.  See, e.g., Letter  from \\nThomas A. Scully, Admin. , Dep\\'t of Health & Human \\nServs., to Kathryn A. Plan t, Dir., N.J. Div. of Med. As-\\nsistance & Health Servs.  (Sept. 19, 2002) . \\nThe Secretary has also required States to give pro-\\nviders the right to an administrative appeal of their ex-\\nclusion from Medicaid.  See 42 C.F.R. 1002.213.  Re-\\nspondents contend that it would have been futile for \\nPlanned Parenthood to pursue  such  an appeal given \\nthat South Carolina terminated its enrollment pursuant \\nto state law.  Br. in Opp. 15 n.2.  But predicted outcomes \\nin individual cases do not make the procedure an  \\nineffective remedy across the board.  States terminate \\nproviders\\' participation in Medic aid for different  rea-\\n31 \\n sons, many of which are well suited to challenge in the \\nadministrative appeals process.  The existence of that \\nalternative mechanism for challenging the termination \\nof a particular provider thus \"buttresse [s]\" the conclu-\\nsion that Congress did not intend to create a privately \\nenforceable right for beneficiaries under Section 1983.  \\nGonzaga , 536 U.S. at 289.   \\nGiven the availability of alternative remedies, find-\\ning a Section 1983 -enforceable right in this case  \"would \\nresult in a curious system\"  of duplicative enforcement.   \\nGillespie , 867 F.3d at 1041 ; see Pet. Br. 42 -43.  Provid-\\ners would  be able to  challenge their disqualification  \\nin state administrative proceedings while individuals \\nwere challenging the same decision in federal court , po-\\ntentially rendering conflicting decisions.  See ibid.  \\nSubjecting States to competing litigation might also  \\n\"dissuade state officials from making decisions that \\nthey believe to be in the public interest \" when amending \\nor implem enting their Medicaid plans.  Gee v. Planned \\nParenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc. , 586 U.S. 1057, 105 8 \\n(2018) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) .   \\nFor other state -plan provisions that mention \"indi-\\nviduals,\" see pp. 27-29, supra , additional enforcement \\nmechanisms may be available.  For example, Section \\n1396a (a)(3)  requires state plans to provide for fair hear-\\nings  for individuals whose claims for  medical assistance  \\nare denied .  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(3) .  By federal regula-\\ntion, s tate fair-hearing system s must  \"meet the due pro-\\ncess standards set forth in Goldberg  v. Kelly , 397 U.S. \\n254 (1970 ),\" 42 C.F.R. 431.205 (d), and provide the op-\\nportunity for a hearing when an individual claims  that \\nthe State has erroneously terminated, suspended, or re-\\nduced his Medicaid benefits or eligibility , 42 C.F.R. \\n431.201, 431.220 .  And a s those federal regulations  \\n32 \\n reflect, the  Due Process Clause  independently requires \\nnotice and a fair hearing before States can deprive indi-\\nviduals of particular entitlements.   See Goldberg , 397 \\nU.S. 254.   Rejecting respondents\\' broad theory of pri-\\nvate enforcement here thus would not leave individual \\nbeneficiaries without a remedy .'}, {'II. The court of appeals erred in finding an individual federal right': 'The Fourth Circuit\\'s decision allowing respondents\\' \\nSection 1983 action misapplied this Court\\'s cases and \\ncontravened this Court\\'s recent admonitions about the \\nrarity of rights -conferring provisions.  The court fo-\\ncused on isolated language in the any -quali fied-provider \\nprovision\\'s text but failed to properly  consider how Sec-\\ntion 1396a(a)(23) fits within Section 1396a(a) and the \\nMedicaid statute writ large . \\n 1. Courts \"must read the words Congress enacted \\n\\'in their context and with a view to their place in the \\noverall statutory scheme.\\' \\u200a\"  Turkiye Halk Bankasi A.S.  \\nv. United States , 598 U.S. 264, 275 (2023) ( citation omit-\\nted).  Thus, as noted,  Talevski first examined the \\nbroader statutory scheme governing nursing homes be-\\nfore discussing how the at -issue provisions fit within \\nthat scheme .  599 U.S. at 184 -185. \\nHere, however, the  court of appeals below focused  \\nnarrowly  on Section 1396a(a)(23)\\'s  references to \"any \\nindividual\" and that eligible individuals \"may obtain\" \\nmedical assistance from qualified providers.  Pet. App. \\n25a.  Even if that language , in isolation,  could be read to \\nconfer individual rights , additional statutory context \\ndispels any inference that Congress unambiguously \\nconferred privately enforceable individual rights.   The \\nany-qualified -provider provision is simply one of a long \\nlist of conditions that the Secretary must find to be \\n33 \\n satisfied before approving state Medicaid plans, and \\nthere are other ways of en suring that Medicaid recipi-\\nents have a choice of qualified providers .  See pp. 30-31, \\nsupra .   \\nBy ignoring the provision\\'s place in the broader statute, \\nthe court of appeals failed to follow Talevski \\'s mode of \\nanalysis and violated the basic rule that \"the words of a \\nstatute must be read in their context and with a view to \\ntheir place in the overall statutory scheme.\"  King  v. \\nBurwell , 576 U.S. 473, 492 (2015) (citation omitted) . \\n 2. The court of appeals  discounted broader evidence \\nthat Section 1396a(a)(23) does not confer privately en-\\nforceable rights based on an erroneous view  of this \\nCourt\\'s precedents and a 1994 statute.  See Pet. App. \\n27a-31a. \\nThe court of appeals downplayed  the any -qualified -\\nprovider provision\\'s place in the broader statute  be-\\ncause the Court in Wilder \"already held that a different \\nfunding condition enumerated in § 1396a(a) confers in-\\ndividual  rights enforceable via 42 U.S.C. §  1983 .\"  See \\nPet. App. 27a -28a.  As discussed, Wilder \\'s reasoning has \\nbeen repudiated.  See p . 21, supra .  Wilder  supplies a \\ncautionary tale, not interpretive instruction.  \\nThe court of appeals also invok ed a separate statu-\\ntory provision,  42 U.S.C. 1320a -2, which  provides, in rel-\\nevant part:  \\nIn an action brought to enforce a provision of [the \\nSocial Security Act], such provision is not to be \\ndeemed unenforceable because of its inclusion in a \\nsection of this chapter  requiring a  State  plan or spec-\\nifying the required contents of a  State  plan.  This \\nsection is not intended to limit or expand the grounds \\nfor determining the availability of private actions to \\nenforce  State  plan requirements other than by \\n34 \\n overturning any such grounds applied in Suter v. \\nArtist M., 112 S. Ct. 1360 (1992), but not applied in \\nprior Supreme Court decisions .  \\nIbid.   The court of appeals seemed to read Section \\n1320a -2 as a directive to consider whether a provision, \\nin isolation , \"speak[s] in clear and unambiguous terms,\" \\nPet. App. 29a, and to place no weight on wheth er the pro-\\nvision is a state -plan requirement.  That was error.  Sec-\\ntion 1320a -2 prohibits courts from deeming provisions \\nunenforceable under Section 1983 merely because of \\ntheir inclusion in a state plan .  See Midwest Foster Care \\n& Adoption Ass\\'n v. Kincade , 712  F.3d 1190, 1200 (8th \\nCir. 2013).   It does not require courts to ignore entirely \\nthe contextual significance of a provision\\' s placement in \\na list of state -plan requirements.  \\nFor similar reasons, the court of appeals was wrong \\nto dismiss the argument that \"the overlay of a substan-\\ntial compliance regime indicates\" that Section \\n1396a(a)(23) \"has an aggregate rather than individual \\nfocus .\"  Pet. App. 30a.  The court noted that Wilder  and \\nTalevski  both involved provisions within substantial -\\ncompliance regimes.  Ibid.   But again,  Wilder  supplies \\nno interpretive guidance.  And Talevski  did consider  \\nbroad  features of the Medicaid program , including that \\nthe typical remedy for noncompli ance with state -plan \\nrequirements is to cut off federal funds.  599 U.S . at 181-\\n182.  The Court simply found those features outweighed \\nby the FNHRA\\'s  recurrent, explicit textual and struc-\\ntural focus on individuals and their \"rights.\"  See id. at \\n183.  Talevski thus  shows that courts should consider \\nthe broader statutory context ; what courts cannot do is \\ntreat placement in a list of state -plan requirements as \\nthe beginning and end of the analysis.   \\n35 \\n 3. In an earlier decision, t he court of appeals also \\nmisread  this Court\\'s decision in O\\'Bannon  v. Town \\nCourt Nursing Center , 447 U.S. 773 (1980) .  See Pet. \\nApp. 62a -63a.6  The court of appeals stated that to the \\nextent O\\'Bannon  is relevant, it \"supports the existence \\nof a private right ,\" because of a statement in the deci-\\nsion that  Section 1396a(a)(23) gives Medicaid recipients \\n\"\\u200a\\'the right  to choose among a range of qualified provid-\\ners.\\'\\u200a\" Pet. App. 62a -63a (quoting O\\'Bannon , 447 U.S. at \\n787)  (emphases added and omitted).   \\nThe court of appeals read O\\'Bannon \\'s language  out \\nof context.   O\\'Bannon  was a due -process case, not a Sec-\\ntion 1983 right -of-action case.  The Court held that \\nPennsylvania did not violate the Due Process Clause by \\nterminating  a nursing home\\'s participation in  the state \\nMedicaid plan  without first holding a hearing , because \\nSection 1396a(a)(23)  does not create a cognizable prop-\\nerty  interest for Medicaid recipients \"to enter an un-\\nqualified home and demand a hearing to certify it.\"  \\nO\\'Bannon , 447 U.S.  at 785.   As an aside, O\\'Bannon  ob-\\nserved that Section 1396a(a)(23) purportedly did create \\n\"the right to choose among a range of qualified  provid-\\ners.\"  Ibid.  But t o the extent O\\'Bannon was recognizing \\nany \"right\" in that passage, it was a property interest \\nsounding in due process , not an unambiguous  conferral \\nof a Section 1983 -enforceable statutory right.    \\nMoreover, read in context, O\\'Bannon \\'s discussion of \\nrights actually  cuts against finding a privately enforce-\\nable right  here .  For purposes of due process , O\\'Bannon  \\nheld that Section 1396a(a)(23) \"clearly does not confer\" \\n \\n6 The court of appeals discussed O\\'Bannon  in its second decision, \\nwhich this Court subsequently vacated in light of Talevski .  See Pet. \\nApp. 62a -63a.  The court  of appeals then declined to revisit  its \"pre-\\nvious determinations\" on remand.  Id. at 12a.  \\n36 \\n the very right  that respondents assert here :  the right \\nto challenge  a State\\'s  termination of a particular pro-\\nvider as unqualified .  447 U.S. at 785 -786.  It would make \\nlittle sense to interpret the same provision as \"unam-\\nbiguously \" conferring an individual right to bring such \\na challenge via Section 1983 .'}]\n"

Section 1806(c) and (d) require the federal or a state government to \\nprovide notice to an aggrieved person whenever it in-\\ntends to introduce such info rmation as evidence in any \\nproceedings against that person. Section 1806(e) af-\\nfords the aggrieved person the opportunity to move to \\nsuppress any such information that was not obtained in compliance with FISA. And Section 1806(f) estab-\\nlishes special in camera  and ex parte  procedures to \\ndetermine the admissibility of such evidence, if the At-torney General attests that a typical adversarial hear-\\ning would harm the national security of the United \\nStates. The question presented is as follows: \\n Whether Section 1806(f ) displaces th e state-secrets \\nprivilege and authorizes a district court to resolve, in \\ncamera  and ex parte , the merits of a lawsuit challeng-\\ning the lawfulness of government surveillance by con-\\nsidering the privileged evidence. \\n \\n \\nii \\n \\nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING BELOW  \\n \\n  Petitioners are the United States of America, the \\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); Christopher A.

Asserting that the \\ninvestigation violated the First and Fifth Amendments (among other laws), Plaint iffs seek monetary damages \\nfrom the Respondent Agents under Bivens v. Six Un-\\nknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics , \\n403 U.S. 388 (1971) ( Bivens ). The Respondent Agents \\nare confident that they would defeat these claims, if \\nonly they had the same op portunity to defend them-\\nselves that is afforded to other federal officers accused \\nof violating the Constitution. However, the Ninth Cir-\\ncuit Court of Appeals\\u2019 decision below denies the Re-spondent Agents that opportunity.  \\n The decision below arises out of the Government\\u2019s \\nassertion in the district court that the identity of \\nthe individuals under invest igation in Operation Flex \\nand the reasons for investigating those individuals are state secrets. As the district court found, that assertion \\nshould spell the end of the case \\u2013 since the court cannot \\nhear evidence as to who the FBI investigated or why, it cannot adjudicate whether the government targeted \\nPlaintiffs based on their religion, and therefore Plain-\\ntiffs\\u2019 Bivens claims must be dismissed.  \\n2 \\n  Yet, the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that Sec-\\ntion 1806(f) of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \\nAct of 1978 (FISA), 50 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1801, et seq. , displaces \\nthe state secrets privilege. As a result, the court of ap-peals held, the district court cannot dismiss the case. \\nInstead, the decision below interpreted Section 1806(f )  \\nas requiring the district court to hear the state secrets evidence in camera and ex parte , and on that basis, de-\\ntermine whether the Respondent Agents violated the \\nConstitution.  \\n The government\\u2019s Petition For A Writ Of Certiorari \\ncapably explains why the Ninth Circuit\\u2019s erroneous in-terpretation of Section 1806(f )  requires immediate re-\\nview by this Court, and the Respondent Agents join in \\nthat Petition in full. But the decision below suffers \\nfrom an additional constitutional infirmity not ad-\\ndressed by the government: by requiring the district \\ncourt to determine the Respondent Agents\\u2019 Bivens  lia-\\nbility in a secret trial, on secret evidence, the Ninth \\nCircuit has deprived the Respondent Agents of their \\nSeventh Amendment right to a trial by jury. This incip-ient violation of the Respondent Agents\\u2019 constitutional \\nrights provides a further reason for immediate review \\nby this Court.  \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nSTATEMENT  \\n The Respondent Agents join in the Statement in-\\ncluded in the government\\u2019s Petition. In addition, the \\nRespondent Agents offer the following supplemental \\n3 \\n information concerning the disposition of their Sev-\\nenth Amendment argument below.  \\n The Ninth Circuit held that the Respondent \\nAgents\\u2019 \\u201cSeventh Amendment argument is prema-\\nture,\\u201d because Plaintiffs\\u2019 claims may be resolved before \\nthey could reach a jury. Pet. App. 65a. For example, the court of appeals noted, the trial court may dismiss \\nPlaintiffs\\u2019 damages  claims in light of recent decisions \\nby this Court that \\u201chave severely restricted the availa-bility of Bivens  actions for new claims and contexts\\u201d \\nlike the ones asserted here. Id., see also Pet. App. 71a \\n(citing Ziglar v. Abbasi , 137 S. Ct. 1843, 1857 (2017)). \\nAccordingly, the Ninth Circuit \\u201cdecline[d] to address \\nthe hypothetical constitutional question\\u201d raised by the \\nRespondent Agents at this time. Id.  \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \\n The Respondent Agents agree that the govern-\\nment\\u2019s Petition should be granted for the reasons \\nstated therein. Specifically, the Respondent Agents \\nagree that Section 1806(f) is unambiguous, that the Ninth Circuit\\u2019s construction thereof is implausible, \\nand that the decision below should be reversed on that \\nbasis. Moreover, to the extent the foregoing is true, the Respondent Agents concede that there is no need to \\nexamine whether the Ninth Circuit\\u2019s construction of \\nSection 1806(f) also runs afoul of the Seventh Amend-ment.  \\n \\n4 \\n A. The Ninth Circuit\\u2019s Decision Must Be Re-\\nversed Under The Cano n Of Constitutional \\nAvoidance. \\n Even if the Ninth Circuit\\u2019s opinion offers a plausi-\\nble interpretation of an ambi guous statute, however, \\nimmediate review in this Court is warranted, because \\nthe canon of constitutional avoidance requires reversal \\nof the decision below.  \\n 1.  The canon of constitutional avoidance \\u201cpro-\\nvides that when a serious doubt is raised about the constitutionality of an act of Congress, this Court will \\nfirst ascertain whether a cons truction of the statute is \\nfairly possible by which the question may be avoided.\\u201d Nielsen v. Preap , 139 S. Ct. 954, 971 (2019) (alterations \\nomitted). If such a construction is permissible, then it \\nshould be adopted. See Crowell v. Benson , 285 U.S. 22, \\n62 (1932). The canon applies in a wide range of con-\\ntexts, including as relevant here, where a proffered \\nconstruction of a federal statute runs afoul of the Sev-enth Amendment. See City of Monterey v. Del Monte \\nDunes at Monterey, Ltd. , 526 U.S. 687, 707 (1999) (be-\\nfore \\u201cinquiring into the applicability of the Seventh Amendment, we must first ascertain whether a con-\\nstruction of the statute is fairly possible by which the \\nconstitutional question may be avoided\\u201d).  \\n 2.  The Seventh Amendment to the United States \\nConstitution provides in relevant part that in \\u201cSuits at common law, where the value in controversy shall ex-\\nceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be \\npreserved.\\u201d U.S. Const. amend. VII. This Court has \\n5 \\n \\u201cconsistently interpreted the phrase \\u2018Suits at common \\nlaw\\u2019 to refer to \\u2018suits in which legal rights were to be \\nascertained and determined, in contradistinction to \\nthose where equitable rights  alone were recognized, \\nand equitable remedies were administered.\\u2019 \\u201d Granfi-\\nnanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg , 492 U.S. 33, 41 (1989) ( quot-\\ning Parsons v. Bedford , 3 Pet. 433, 447, 7 L.Ed. 732 \\n(1830)). Put another way, the Seventh Amendment em-\\nbraces \\u201c \\u2018all suits which are not of equity and admiralty \\njurisdiction, whatever might be the peculiar form which they may assume to settle legal rights.\\u2019 \\u201d Curtis \\nv. Loether , 415 U.S. 189, 193 (1974) ( quoting Parsons , 3 \\nPet. at 446-447).   \\n 3. Whether \\u201cthe government had denied a consti-\\ntutional right in acting outside the bounds of its au-thority, and, if so, the extent of any resulting damages\\u201d \\nare quintessential \\u201cquestions for the jury\\u201d under the \\nSeventh Amendment. City of Monterey , 526 U.S. at 722. \\nIt is thus unsurprising that  this Court has held that \\nBivens claims should be heard by a jury. See Carlson v. \\nGreen , 446 U.S. 14, 22 (1980) (noting that a party can \\nopt for a jury in a Bivens suit, unlike an action under \\nthe Federal Tort Claims Act). The circuit courts \\u2013 in-\\ncluding the Ninth Circuit \\u2013 are in agreement. See, e.g. , \\nNurse v. United States , 226 F.3d 996, 1005 (9th Cir. \\n2000) (following Carlson and noting that jury trials are \\n\\u201cavailable in claims against individual defendants un-der Bivens \\u201d).  \\n 4.  Presumably in reliance on these authorities, \\nPlaintiffs demanded a jury trial in their complaint. \\n(See, e.g. , Case 8:11-cv-00301, Docket no. 1 at 1.) \\n6 \\n Plaintiffs also conceded  on appeal that their Bivens \\nclaims must ordinarily be decided by a jury. (Case 12-\\n56874, Dkt. 79-2 at 21 (\\u201cAs a threshold matter, the Sev-\\nenth Amendment protects plaintiffs\\u2019 right to jury trial as well\\u201d).) In other words, it is undisputed among the \\nparties that, but for the decision below, the Respondent \\nAgents have a right to a jury trial of Plaintiffs\\u2019 Bivens \\nclaims.  \\n 5.  In light of the foregoing, the Ninth Circuit\\u2019s \\nconstruction of Section 1806(f )  raises serious doubt as \\nto its constitutionality under the Seventh Amendment. \\nThat construction requires the district court to adjudi-cate the merits of Plaintiffs\\u2019 Bivens claims in an ex \\nparte  and in camera  proceeding instead of in a trial be-\\nfore a jury. Absent a waiver, the Seventh Amendment simply does not permit a district court judge, rather \\nthan a jury, to determine the merits of a Bivens claim \\nasserted against a federal officer. By placing sole re-sponsibility for determining liability \\u2013 and presumably \\ndamages \\u2013 in the hands of the district court judge, the \\ndecision below deprives the Respondent Agents of their right to a jury trial.  \\n 6.  In light of these serious doubts, this Court \\nshould adopt the far more plausible interpretation of \\nthe statute advanced by the government in its Petition: \\nthat Section 1806(f )  may create a procedure for \\u201cre-solving questions of admissib ility or suppression\\u201d of \\nFISA-related evidence in certain circumstances, but \\nthat section does not create \\u201ca freestanding in camera  \\nand ex parte  mechanism for resolving the merits of a \\ncase brought against the government or its officers.\\u201d \\n7 \\n Pet. at 15. This construction comports with FISA\\u2019s stat-\\nutory text and pays proper deference to the Executive\\u2019s \\nresponsibility to safeguard the national security, while \\nalso avoiding an irreconcilable clash with the Respond-ent Agents\\u2019 Seventh Amendment rights. \\n \\nB. If The Canon Of Constitutional Avoidance \\nDoes Not Apply, The Decision Below Should \\nBe Reversed And The Ninth Circuit Required \\nTo Address The Respondent Agents\\u2019 Seventh Amendment Rights.  \\n As noted above, the canon of constitutional avoid-\\nance \\u201chas no application absent ambiguity\\u201d in the \\nsubject statute. Nielsen , 139 S. Ct. at 972 (quotations \\nomitted). In other words, the canon cannot be used to \\noverturn the Ninth Circuit\\u2019s interpretation of Section \\n1806(f), if the statutory te xt unambiguously supports \\nthat interpretation. Id. \\n However, even if this Court were to adopt the \\nNinth Circuit\\u2019s construction of the statute, the case \\nshould still be remanded to the Ninth Circuit for that \\ncourt to consider \\u2013 at this stage in the proceedings, not \\nat a later stage \\u2013 whether the statute must yield to the \\nSeventh Amendment. See Nielsen , 139 S. Ct. at 972 \\n(noting that where constitutional avoidance does not apply, a statute may still fall if a \\u201chead-on\\u201d challenge \\nestablishes that it violates the Constitution); see also \\nCity of Monterey , 526 U.S. at 707-22 (finding that civil \\nrights claims under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983 require a jury un-\\nder the Seventh Amendment, even though the statute \\n8 \\n itself cannot be plausibly interpreted as including such \\na requirement).  \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nCONCLUSION \\n For all of the foregoing reasons, this Court\\u2019s review \\nis warranted, and the government\\u2019s Petition For A Writ \\nOf Certiorari should be granted. \\nRespectfully submitted. \\nALEXANDER  H.

Section 1806(c) and (d) require the federal or a state government to \\nprovide notice to an aggrieved person whenever it in-\\ntends to introduce such info rmation as evidence in any \\nproceedings against that person. Section 1806(e) af-\\nfords the aggrieved person the opportunity to move to \\nsuppress any such information that was not obtained in compliance with FISA. And Section 1806(f) estab-\\nlishes special in camera  and ex parte  procedures to \\ndetermine the admissibility of such evidence, if the At-torney General attests that a typical adversarial hear-\\ning would harm the national security of the United \\nStates. The question presented is as follows: \\n Whether Section 1806(f ) displaces th e state-secrets \\nprivilege and authorizes a district court to resolve, in \\ncamera  and ex parte , the merits of a lawsuit challeng-\\ning the lawfulness of government surveillance by con-\\nsidering the privileged evidence. \\n \\n \\nii \\n \\nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING BELOW  \\n \\n  Petitioners are the United States of America, the \\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); Christopher A.

Asserting that the \\ninvestigation violated the First and Fifth Amendments (among other laws), Plaint iffs seek monetary damages \\nfrom the Respondent Agents under Bivens v. Six Un-\\nknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics , \\n403 U.S. 388 (1971) ( Bivens ). The Respondent Agents \\nare confident that they would defeat these claims, if \\nonly they had the same op portunity to defend them-\\nselves that is afforded to other federal officers accused \\nof violating the Constitution. However, the Ninth Cir-\\ncuit Court of Appeals' decision below denies the Re-spondent Agents that opportunity.  \\n The decision below arises out of the Government's \\nassertion in the district court that the identity of \\nthe individuals under invest igation in Operation Flex \\nand the reasons for investigating those individuals are state secrets. As the district court found, that assertion \\nshould spell the end of the case \\u2013 since the court cannot \\nhear evidence as to who the FBI investigated or why, it cannot adjudicate whether the government targeted \\nPlaintiffs based on their religion, and therefore Plain-\\ntiffs' Bivens claims must be dismissed.  \\n2 \\n  Yet, the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that Sec-\\ntion 1806(f) of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \\nAct of 1978 (FISA), 50 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1801, et seq. , displaces \\nthe state secrets privilege. As a result, the court of ap-peals held, the district court cannot dismiss the case. \\nInstead, the decision below interpreted Section 1806(f )  \\nas requiring the district court to hear the state secrets evidence in camera and ex parte , and on that basis, de-\\ntermine whether the Respondent Agents violated the \\nConstitution.  \\n The government's Petition For A Writ Of Certiorari \\ncapably explains why the Ninth Circuit's erroneous in-terpretation of Section 1806(f )  requires immediate re-\\nview by this Court, and the Respondent Agents join in \\nthat Petition in full. But the decision below suffers \\nfrom an additional constitutional infirmity not ad-\\ndressed by the government: by requiring the district \\ncourt to determine the Respondent Agents' Bivens  lia-\\nbility in a secret trial, on secret evidence, the Ninth \\nCircuit has deprived the Respondent Agents of their \\nSeventh Amendment right to a trial by jury. This incip-ient violation of the Respondent Agents' constitutional \\nrights provides a further reason for immediate review \\nby this Court.  \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nSTATEMENT  \\n The Respondent Agents join in the Statement in-\\ncluded in the government's Petition. In addition, the \\nRespondent Agents offer the following supplemental \\n3 \\n information concerning the disposition of their Sev-\\nenth Amendment argument below.  \\n The Ninth Circuit held that the Respondent \\nAgents' \\\"Seventh Amendment argument is prema-\\nture,\\\" because Plaintiffs' claims may be resolved before \\nthey could reach a jury. Pet. App. 65a. For example, the court of appeals noted, the trial court may dismiss \\nPlaintiffs' damages  claims in light of recent decisions \\nby this Court that \\\"have severely restricted the availa-bility of Bivens  actions for new claims and contexts\\\" \\nlike the ones asserted here. Id., see also Pet. App. 71a \\n(citing Ziglar v. Abbasi , 137 S. Ct. 1843, 1857 (2017)). \\nAccordingly, the Ninth Circuit \\\"decline[d] to address \\nthe hypothetical constitutional question\\\" raised by the \\nRespondent Agents at this time. Id.  \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \\n The Respondent Agents agree that the govern-\\nment's Petition should be granted for the reasons \\nstated therein. Specifically, the Respondent Agents \\nagree that Section 1806(f) is unambiguous, that the Ninth Circuit's construction thereof is implausible, \\nand that the decision below should be reversed on that \\nbasis. Moreover, to the extent the foregoing is true, the Respondent Agents concede that there is no need to \\nexamine whether the Ninth Circuit's construction of \\nSection 1806(f) also runs afoul of the Seventh Amend-ment.  \\n \\n4 \\n A. The Ninth Circuit's Decision Must Be Re-\\nversed Under The Cano n Of Constitutional \\nAvoidance. \\n Even if the Ninth Circuit's opinion offers a plausi-\\nble interpretation of an ambi guous statute, however, \\nimmediate review in this Court is warranted, because \\nthe canon of constitutional avoidance requires reversal \\nof the decision below.  \\n 1.  The canon of constitutional avoidance \\\"pro-\\nvides that when a serious doubt is raised about the constitutionality of an act of Congress, this Court will \\nfirst ascertain whether a cons truction of the statute is \\nfairly possible by which the question may be avoided.\\\" Nielsen v. Preap , 139 S. Ct. 954, 971 (2019) (alterations \\nomitted). If such a construction is permissible, then it \\nshould be adopted. See Crowell v. Benson , 285 U.S. 22, \\n62 (1932). The canon applies in a wide range of con-\\ntexts, including as relevant here, where a proffered \\nconstruction of a federal statute runs afoul of the Sev-enth Amendment. See City of Monterey v. Del Monte \\nDunes at Monterey, Ltd. , 526 U.S. 687, 707 (1999) (be-\\nfore \\\"inquiring into the applicability of the Seventh Amendment, we must first ascertain whether a con-\\nstruction of the statute is fairly possible by which the \\nconstitutional question may be avoided\\\").  \\n 2.  The Seventh Amendment to the United States \\nConstitution provides in relevant part that in \\\"Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall ex-\\nceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be \\npreserved.\\\" U.S. Const. amend.

This Court has \\n5 \\n \\\"consistently interpreted the phrase 'Suits at common \\nlaw' to refer to 'suits in which legal rights were to be \\nascertained and determined, in contradistinction to \\nthose where equitable rights  alone were recognized, \\nand equitable remedies were administered.' \\\" Granfi-\\nnanciera, S.A. v.

Asserting that the \\ninvestigation violated the First and Fifth Amendments (among other laws), Plaint iffs seek monetary damages \\nfrom the Respondent Agents under Bivens v. Six Un-\\nknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics , \\n403 U.S. 388 (1971) ( Bivens ). The Respondent Agents \\nare confident that they would defeat these claims, if \\nonly they had the same op portunity to defend them-\\nselves that is afforded to other federal officers accused \\nof violating the Constitution. However, the Ninth Cir-\\ncuit Court of Appeals' decision below denies the Re-spondent Agents that opportunity.  \\n The decision below arises out of the Government's \\nassertion in the district court that the identity of \\nthe individuals under invest igation in Operation Flex \\nand the reasons for investigating those individuals are state secrets. As the district court found, that assertion \\nshould spell the end of the case \\u2013 since the court cannot \\nhear evidence as to who the FBI investigated or why, it cannot adjudicate whether the government targeted \\nPlaintiffs based on their religion, and therefore Plain-\\ntiffs' Bivens claims must be dismissed.  \\n2 \\n  Yet, the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that Sec-\\ntion 1806(f) of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \\nAct of 1978 (FISA), 50 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1801, et seq. , displaces \\nthe state secrets privilege. As a result, the court of ap-peals held, the district court cannot dismiss the case. \\nInstead, the decision below interpreted Section 1806(f )  \\nas requiring the district court to hear the state secrets evidence in camera and ex parte , and on that basis, de-\\ntermine whether the Respondent Agents violated the \\nConstitution.  \\n The government's Petition For A Writ Of Certiorari \\ncapably explains why the Ninth Circuit's erroneous in-terpretation of Section 1806(f )  requires immediate re-\\nview by this Court, and the Respondent Agents join in \\nthat Petition in full. But the decision below suffers \\nfrom an additional constitutional infirmity not ad-\\ndressed by the government: by requiring the district \\ncourt to determine the Respondent Agents' Bivens  lia-\\nbility in a secret trial, on secret evidence, the Ninth \\nCircuit has deprived the Respondent Agents of their \\nSeventh Amendment right to a trial by jury. This incip-ient violation of the Respondent Agents' constitutional \\nrights provides a further reason for immediate review \\nby this Court.  \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nSTATEMENT  \\n The Respondent Agents join in the Statement in-\\ncluded in the government's Petition. In addition, the \\nRespondent Agents offer the following supplemental \\n3 \\n information concerning the disposition of their Sev-\\nenth Amendment argument below.  \\n The Ninth Circuit held that the Respondent \\nAgents' \\\"Seventh Amendment argument is prema-\\nture,\\\" because Plaintiffs' claims may be resolved before \\nthey could reach a jury. Pet. App. 65a. For example, the court of appeals noted, the trial court may dismiss \\nPlaintiffs' damages  claims in light of recent decisions \\nby this Court that \\\"have severely restricted the availa-bility of Bivens  actions for new claims and contexts\\\" \\nlike the ones asserted here. Id., see also Pet. App. 71a \\n(citing Ziglar v. Abbasi , 137 S. Ct. 1843, 1857 (2017)). \\nAccordingly, the Ninth Circuit \\\"decline[d] to address \\nthe hypothetical constitutional question\\\" raised by the \\nRespondent Agents at this time. Id.  \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \\n The Respondent Agents agree that the govern-\\nment's Petition should be granted for the reasons \\nstated therein. Specifically, the Respondent Agents \\nagree that Section 1806(f) is unambiguous, that the Ninth Circuit's construction thereof is implausible, \\nand that the decision below should be reversed on that \\nbasis. Moreover, to the extent the foregoing is true, the Respondent Agents concede that there is no need to \\nexamine whether the Ninth Circuit's construction of \\nSection 1806(f) also runs afoul of the Seventh Amend-ment.  \\n \\n4 \\n A. The Ninth Circuit's Decision Must Be Re-\\nversed Under The Cano n Of Constitutional \\nAvoidance. \\n Even if the Ninth Circuit's opinion offers a plausi-\\nble interpretation of an ambi guous statute, however, \\nimmediate review in this Court is warranted, because \\nthe canon of constitutional avoidance requires reversal \\nof the decision below.  \\n 1.  The canon of constitutional avoidance \\\"pro-\\nvides that when a serious doubt is raised about the constitutionality of an act of Congress, this Court will \\nfirst ascertain whether a cons truction of the statute is \\nfairly possible by which the question may be avoided.\\\" Nielsen v. Preap , 139 S. Ct. 954, 971 (2019) (alterations \\nomitted). If such a construction is permissible, then it \\nshould be adopted. See Crowell v. Benson , 285 U.S. 22, \\n62 (1932). The canon applies in a wide range of con-\\ntexts, including as relevant here, where a proffered \\nconstruction of a federal statute runs afoul of the Sev-enth Amendment. See City of Monterey v. Del Monte \\nDunes at Monterey, Ltd. , 526 U.S. 687, 707 (1999) (be-\\nfore \\\"inquiring into the applicability of the Seventh Amendment, we must first ascertain whether a con-\\nstruction of the statute is fairly possible by which the \\nconstitutional question may be avoided\\\").  \\n 2.  The Seventh Amendment to the United States \\nConstitution provides in relevant part that in \\\"Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall ex-\\nceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be \\npreserved.\\\" U.S. Const. amend. VII. This Court has \\n5 \\n \\\"consistently interpreted the phrase 'Suits at common \\nlaw' to refer to 'suits in which legal rights were to be \\nascertained and determined, in contradistinction to \\nthose where equitable rights  alone were recognized, \\nand equitable remedies were administered.' \\\" Granfi-\\nnanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg , 492 U.S. 33, 41 (1989) ( quot-\\ning Parsons v. Bedford , 3 Pet. 433, 447, 7 L.Ed. 732 \\n(1830)). Put another way, the Seventh Amendment em-\\nbraces \\\" 'all suits which are not of equity and admiralty \\njurisdiction, whatever might be the peculiar form which they may assume to settle legal rights.' \\\" Curtis \\nv. Loether , 415 U.S. 189, 193 (1974) ( quoting Parsons , 3 \\nPet. at 446-447).   \\n 3. Whether \\\"the government had denied a consti-\\ntutional right in acting outside the bounds of its au-thority, and, if so, the extent of any resulting damages\\\" \\nare quintessential \\\"questions for the jury\\\" under the \\nSeventh Amendment. City of Monterey , 526 U.S. at 722. \\nIt is thus unsurprising that  this Court has held that \\nBivens claims should be heard by a jury. See Carlson v. \\nGreen , 446 U.S. 14, 22 (1980) (noting that a party can \\nopt for a jury in a Bivens suit, unlike an action under \\nthe Federal Tort Claims Act). The circuit courts \\u2013 in-\\ncluding the Ninth Circuit \\u2013 are in agreement. See, e.g. , \\nNurse v. United States , 226 F.3d 996, 1005 (9th Cir. \\n2000) (following Carlson and noting that jury trials are \\n\\\"available in claims against individual defendants un-der Bivens \\\").  \\n 4.  Presumably in reliance on these authorities, \\nPlaintiffs demanded a jury trial in their complaint. \\n(See, e.g. , Case 8:11-cv-00301, Docket no. 1 at 1.) \\n6 \\n Plaintiffs also conceded  on appeal that their Bivens \\nclaims must ordinarily be decided by a jury. (Case 12-\\n56874, Dkt. 79-2 at 21 (\\\"As a threshold matter, the Sev-\\nenth Amendment protects plaintiffs' right to jury trial as well\\\").) In other words, it is undisputed among the \\nparties that, but for the decision below, the Respondent \\nAgents have a right to a jury trial of Plaintiffs' Bivens \\nclaims.  \\n 5.  In light of the foregoing, the Ninth Circuit's \\nconstruction of Section 1806(f )  raises serious doubt as \\nto its constitutionality under the Seventh Amendment. \\nThat construction requires the district court to adjudi-cate the merits of Plaintiffs' Bivens claims in an ex \\nparte  and in camera  proceeding instead of in a trial be-\\nfore a jury. Absent a waiver, the Seventh Amendment simply does not permit a district court judge, rather \\nthan a jury, to determine the merits of a Bivens claim \\nasserted against a federal officer. By placing sole re-sponsibility for determining liability \\u2013 and presumably \\ndamages \\u2013 in the hands of the district court judge, the \\ndecision below deprives the Respondent Agents of their right to a jury trial.  \\n 6.  In light of these serious doubts, this Court \\nshould adopt the far more plausible interpretation of \\nthe statute advanced by the government in its Petition: \\nthat Section 1806(f )  may create a procedure for \\\"re-solving questions of admissib ility or suppression\\\" of \\nFISA-related evidence in certain circumstances, but \\nthat section does not create \\\"a freestanding in camera  \\nand ex parte  mechanism for resolving the merits of a \\ncase brought against the government or its officers.\\\" \\n7 \\n Pet. at 15. This construction comports with FISA's stat-\\nutory text and pays proper deference to the Executive's \\nresponsibility to safeguard the national security, while \\nalso avoiding an irreconcilable clash with the Respond-ent Agents' Seventh Amendment rights. \\n \\nB. If The Canon Of Constitutional Avoidance \\nDoes Not Apply, The Decision Below Should \\nBe Reversed And The Ninth Circuit Required \\nTo Address The Respondent Agents' Seventh Amendment Rights.  \\n As noted above, the canon of constitutional avoid-\\nance \\\"has no application absent ambiguity\\\" in the \\nsubject statute. Nielsen , 139 S. Ct. at 972 (quotations \\nomitted). In other words, the canon cannot be used to \\noverturn the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of Section \\n1806(f), if the statutory te xt unambiguously supports \\nthat interpretation. Id. \\n However, even if this Court were to adopt the \\nNinth Circuit's construction of the statute, the case \\nshould still be remanded to the Ninth Circuit for that \\ncourt to consider \\u2013 at this stage in the proceedings, not \\nat a later stage \\u2013 whether the statute must yield to the \\nSeventh Amendment. See Nielsen , 139 S. Ct. at 972 \\n(noting that where constitutional avoidance does not apply, a statute may still fall if a \\\"head-on\\\" challenge \\nestablishes that it violates the Constitution); see also \\nCity of Monterey , 526 U.S. at 707-22 (finding that civil \\nrights claims under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983 require a jury un-\\nder the Seventh Amendment, even though the statute \\n8 \\n itself cannot be plausibly interpreted as including such \\na requirement).  \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_args\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sections_alt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/20-828.html\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

      "Respondent Agents) were part of an investigation \n",
      "known as Operation Flex, in  which the FBI allegedly \n",
      "gathered information about Plaintiffs and other Mus-\n",

      "are confident that they would defeat these claims, if \n",
      "only they had the same op portunity to defend them-\n",
      "selves that is afforded to other federal officers accused \n",
      "of violating the Constitution. However, the Ninth Cir-\n",
      "cuit Court of Appeals' decision below denies the Re-spondent Agents that opportunity.  \n",
      " The decision below arises out of the Government's \n",
      "assertion in the district court that the identity of \n",
      "the individuals under invest igation in Operation Flex \n",
      "and the reasons for investigating those individuals are state secrets. As the district court found, that assertion \n",
      "should spell the end of the case – since the court cannot \n",
      "hear evidence as to who the FBI investigated or why, it cannot adjudicate whether the government targeted \n",
      "Plaintiffs based on their religion, and therefore Plain-\n",
      "tiffs' Bivens claims must be dismissed.  \n",

      "tion 1806(f) of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n",
      "Act of 1978 (FISA), 50 U.S.C. § 1801, et seq. , displaces \n",
      "the state secrets privilege. As a result, the court of ap-peals held, the district court cannot dismiss the case. \n",
      "Instead, the decision below interpreted Section 1806(f )  \n",
      "as requiring the district court to hear the state secrets evidence in camera and ex parte , and on that basis, de-\n",
      "termine whether the Respondent Agents violated the \n",

      " The government's Petition For A Writ Of Certiorari \n",
      "capably explains why the Ninth Circuit's erroneous in-terpretation of Section 1806(f )  requires immediate re-\n",
      "view by this Court, and the Respondent Agents join in \n",
      "that Petition in full. But the decision below suffers \n",
      "from an additional constitutional infirmity not ad-\n",
      "dressed by the government: by requiring the district \n",
      "court to determine the Respondent Agents' Bivens  lia-\n",
      "bility in a secret trial, on secret evidence, the Ninth \n",
      "Circuit has deprived the Respondent Agents of their \n",
      "Seventh Amendment right to a trial by jury. This incip-ient violation of the Respondent Agents' constitutional \n",

      "REASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \n",
      " The Respondent Agents agree that the govern-\n",
      "ment's Petition should be granted for the reasons \n",
      "stated therein. Specifically, the Respondent Agents \n",
      "agree that Section 1806(f) is unambiguous, that the Ninth Circuit's construction thereof is implausible, \n",
      "and that the decision below should be reversed on that \n",
      "basis. Moreover, to the extent the foregoing is true, the Respondent Agents concede that there is no need to \n",
      "examine whether the Ninth Circuit's construction of \n",
      "Section 1806(f) also runs afoul of the Seventh Amend-ment.  \n",
      " \n",
      "4 \n",
      " A. The Ninth Circuit's Decision Must Be Re-\n",
      "versed Under The Cano n Of Constitutional \n",
      "Avoidance. \n",
      " Even if the Ninth Circuit's opinion offers a plausi-\n",
      "ble interpretation of an ambi guous statute, however, \n",
      "immediate review in this Court is warranted, because \n",
      "the canon of constitutional avoidance requires reversal \n",
      "of the decision below.  \n",
      " 1.  The canon of constitutional avoidance \"pro-\n",
      "vides that when a serious doubt is raised about the constitutionality of an act of Congress, this Court will \n",
      "first ascertain whether a cons truction of the statute is \n",
      "fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.\" Nielsen v. Preap , 139 S. Ct. 954, 971 (2019) (alterations \n",
      "omitted). If such a construction is permissible, then it \n",
      "should be adopted. See Crowell v. Benson , 285 U.S. 22, \n",
      "62 (1932). The canon applies in a wide range of con-\n",
      "texts, including as relevant here, where a proffered \n",
      "construction of a federal statute runs afoul of the Sev-enth Amendment. See City of Monterey v. Del Monte \n",
      "Dunes at Monterey, Ltd. , 526 U.S. 687, 707 (1999) (be-\n",

      "struction of the statute is fairly possible by which the \n",
      "constitutional question may be avoided\").  \n",
      " 2.  The Seventh Amendment to the United States \n",

      "and equitable remedies were administered.' \" Granfi-\n",

      "ing Parsons v. Bedford , 3 Pet. 433, 447, 7 L.Ed. 732 \n",

      "braces \" 'all suits which are not of equity and admiralty \n",

      "v. Loether , 415 U.S. 189, 193 (1974) ( quoting Parsons , 3 \n",
      "Pet. at 446-447).   \n",
      " 3. Whether \"the government had denied a consti-\n",
      "tutional right in acting outside the bounds of its au-thority, and, if so, the extent of any resulting damages\" \n",
      "are quintessential \"questions for the jury\" under the \n",
      "Seventh Amendment. City of Monterey , 526 U.S. at 722. \n",
      "It is thus unsurprising that  this Court has held that \n",
      "Bivens claims should be heard by a jury. See Carlson v. \n",
      "Green , 446 U.S. 14, 22 (1980) (noting that a party can \n",
      "opt for a jury in a Bivens suit, unlike an action under \n",
      "the Federal Tort Claims Act). The circuit courts – in-\n",
      "cluding the Ninth Circuit – are in agreement. See, e.g. , \n",
      "Nurse v. United States , 226 F.3d 996, 1005 (9th Cir. \n",
      "2000) (following Carlson and noting that jury trials are \n",
      "\"available in claims against individual defendants un-der Bivens \").  \n",
      " 4.  Presumably in reliance on these authorities, \n",
      "Plaintiffs demanded a jury trial in their complaint. \n",
      "(See, e.g. , Case 8:11-cv-00301, Docket no. 1 at 1.) \n",
      "6 \n",
      " Plaintiffs also conceded  on appeal that their Bivens \n",
      "claims must ordinarily be decided by a jury. (Case 12-\n",
      "56874, Dkt. 79-2 at 21 (\"As a threshold matter, the Sev-\n",
      "enth Amendment protects plaintiffs' right to jury trial as well\").) In other words, it is undisputed among the \n",
      "parties that, but for the decision below, the Respondent \n",
      "Agents have a right to a jury trial of Plaintiffs' Bivens \n",
      "claims.  \n",
      " 5.  In light of the foregoing, the Ninth Circuit's \n",
      "construction of Section 1806(f )  raises serious doubt as \n",
      "to its constitutionality under the Seventh Amendment. \n",
      "That construction requires the district court to adjudi-cate the merits of Plaintiffs' Bivens claims in an ex \n",
      "parte  and in camera  proceeding instead of in a trial be-\n",
      "fore a jury. Absent a waiver, the Seventh Amendment simply does not permit a district court judge, rather \n",
      "than a jury, to determine the merits of a Bivens claim \n",
      "asserted against a federal officer. By placing sole re-sponsibility for determining liability – and presumably \n",
      "damages – in the hands of the district court judge, the \n",
      "decision below deprives the Respondent Agents of their right to a jury trial.  \n",
      " 6.  In light of these serious doubts, this Court \n",
      "should adopt the far more plausible interpretation of \n",
      "the statute advanced by the government in its Petition: \n",
      "that Section 1806(f )  may create a procedure for \"re-solving questions of admissib ility or suppression\" of \n",
      "FISA-related evidence in certain circumstances, but \n",
      "that section does not create \"a freestanding in camera  \n",
      "and ex parte  mechanism for resolving the merits of a \n",
      "case brought against the government or its officers.\" \n",
      "7 \n",
      " Pet. at 15. This construction comports with FISA's stat-\n",
      "utory text and pays proper deference to the Executive's \n",
      "responsibility to safeguard the national security, while \n",
      "also avoiding an irreconcilable clash with the Respond-ent Agents' Seventh Amendment rights. \n",
      " \n",
      "B. If The Canon Of Constitutional Avoidance \n",
      "Does Not Apply, The Decision Below Should \n",
      "Be Reversed And The Ninth Circuit Required \n",
      "To Address The Respondent Agents' Seventh Amendment Rights.  \n",
      " As noted above, the canon of constitutional avoid-\n",
      "ance \"has no application absent ambiguity\" in the \n",
      "subject statute. Nielsen , 139 S. Ct. at 972 (quotations \n",
      "omitted). In other words, the canon cannot be used to \n",
      "overturn the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of Section \n",
      "1806(f), if the statutory te xt unambiguously supports \n",

      "{\"A. The Ninth Circuit's Decision Must Be Reversed Under The Canon Of Constitutional Avoidance  \": '. \\n Even if the Ninth Circuit\\'s opinion offers a plausi-\\nble interpretation of an ambi guous statute, however, \\nimmediate review in this Court is warranted, because \\nthe canon of constitutional avoidance requires reversal \\nof the decision below.  \\n 1.  The canon of constitutional avoidance \"pro-\\nvides that when a serious doubt is raised about the constitutionality of an act of Congress, this Court will \\nfirst ascertain whether a cons truction of the statute is \\nfairly possible by which the question may be avoided.\" Nielsen v. Preap , 139 S. Ct. 954, 971 (2019) (alterations \\nomitted). If such a construction is permissible, then it \\nshould be adopted. See Crowell v. Benson , 285 U.S. 22, \\n62 (1932). The canon applies in a wide range of con-\\ntexts, including as relevant here, where a proffered \\nconstruction of a federal statute runs afoul of the Sev-enth Amendment. See City of Monterey v. Del Monte \\nDunes at Monterey, Ltd. , 526 U.S. 687, 707 (1999) (be-\\nfore \"inquiring into the applicability of the Seventh Amendment, we must first ascertain whether a con-\\nstruction of the statute is fairly possible by which the \\nconstitutional question may be avoided\").  \\n 2.  The Seventh Amendment to the United States \\nConstitution provides in relevant part that in \"Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall ex-\\nceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be \\npreserved.\" U.S. Const. amend. VII. This Court has \\n5 \\n \"consistently interpreted the phrase \\'Suits at common \\nlaw\\' to refer to \\'suits in which legal rights were to be \\nascertained and determined, in contradistinction to \\nthose where equitable rights  alone were recognized, \\nand equitable remedies were administered.\\' \" Granfi-\\nnanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg , 492 U.S. 33, 41 (1989) ( quot-\\ning Parsons v. Bedford , 3 Pet. 433, 447, 7 L.Ed. 732 \\n(1830)). Put another way, the Seventh Amendment em-\\nbraces \" \\'all suits which are not of equity and admiralty \\njurisdiction, whatever might be the peculiar form which they may assume to settle legal rights.\\' \" Curtis \\nv. Loether , 415 U.S. 189, 193 (1974) ( quoting Parsons , 3 \\nPet. at 446-447).   \\n 3. Whether \"the government had denied a consti-\\ntutional right in acting outside the bounds of its au-thority, and, if so, the extent of any resulting damages\" \\nare quintessential \"questions for the jury\" under the \\nSeventh Amendment. City of Monterey , 526 U.S. at 722. \\nIt is thus unsurprising that  this Court has held that \\nBivens claims should be heard by a jury. See Carlson v. \\nGreen , 446 U.S. 14, 22 (1980) (noting that a party can \\nopt for a jury in a Bivens suit, unlike an action under \\nthe Federal Tort Claims Act). The circuit courts – in-\\ncluding the Ninth Circuit – are in agreement. See, e.g. , \\nNurse v. United States , 226 F.3d 996, 1005 (9th Cir. \\n2000) (following Carlson and noting that jury trials are \\n\"available in claims against individual defendants un-der Bivens \").  \\n 4.  Presumably in reliance on these authorities, \\nPlaintiffs demanded a jury trial in their complaint. \\n(See, e.g. , Case 8:11-cv-00301, Docket no. 1 at 1.) \\n6 \\n Plaintiffs also conceded  on appeal that their Bivens \\nclaims must ordinarily be decided by a jury. (Case 12-\\n56874, Dkt. 79-2 at 21 (\"As a threshold matter, the Sev-\\nenth Amendment protects plaintiffs\\' right to jury trial as well\").) In other words, it is undisputed among the \\nparties that, but for the decision below, the Respondent \\nAgents have a right to a jury trial of Plaintiffs\\' Bivens \\nclaims.  \\n 5.  In light of the foregoing, the Ninth Circuit\\'s \\nconstruction of Section 1806(f )  raises serious doubt as \\nto its constitutionality under the Seventh Amendment. \\nThat construction requires the district court to adjudi-cate the merits of Plaintiffs\\' Bivens claims in an ex \\nparte  and in camera  proceeding instead of in a trial be-\\nfore a jury. Absent a waiver, the Seventh Amendment simply does not permit a district court judge, rather \\nthan a jury, to determine the merits of a Bivens claim \\nasserted against a federal officer. By placing sole re-sponsibility for determining liability – and presumably \\ndamages – in the hands of the district court judge, the \\ndecision below deprives the Respondent Agents of their right to a jury trial.  \\n 6.  In light of these serious doubts, this Court \\nshould adopt the far more plausible interpretation of \\nthe statute advanced by the government in its Petition: \\nthat Section 1806(f )  may create a procedure for \"re-solving questions of admissib ility or suppression\" of \\nFISA-related evidence in certain circumstances, but \\nthat section does not create \"a freestanding in camera  \\nand ex parte  mechanism for resolving the merits of a \\ncase brought against the government or its officers.\" \\n7 \\n Pet. at 15. This construction comports with FISA\\'s stat-\\nutory text and pays proper deference to the Executive\\'s \\nresponsibility to safeguard the national security, while \\nalso avoiding an irreconcilable clash with the Respond-ent Agents\\' Seventh Amendment rights.'}\n",
      "\n",
      "{\"B. If The Canon Of Constitutional Avoidance Does Not Apply, The Decision Below Should Be Reversed And The Ninth Circuit Required To Address The Respondent Agents' Seventh Amendment Rights\": '.  \\n As noted above, the canon of constitutional avoid-\\nance \"has no application absent ambiguity\" in the \\nsubject statute. Nielsen , 139 S. Ct. at 972 (quotations \\nomitted). In other words, the canon cannot be used to \\noverturn the Ninth Circuit\\'s interpretation of Section \\n1806(f), if the statutory te xt unambiguously supports \\nthat interpretation. Id. \\n However, even if this Court were to adopt the \\nNinth Circuit\\'s construction of the statute, the case \\nshould still be remanded to the Ninth Circuit for that \\ncourt to consider – at this stage in the proceedings, not \\nat a later stage – whether the statute must yield to the \\nSeventh Amendment. See Nielsen , 139 S. Ct. at 972 \\n(noting that where constitutional avoidance does not apply, a statute may still fall if a \"head-on\" challenge \\nestablishes that it violates the Constitution); see also \\nCity of Monterey , 526 U.S. at 707-22 (finding that civil \\nrights claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 require a jury un-\\nder the Seventh Amendment, even though the statute \\n8 \\n itself cannot be plausibly interpreted as including such \\na requirement).  \\n--------------------------------- ♦ ---------------------------------'}\n"

      "{'I. THE RULE OF LENITY SHOULD BE APPLIED RIGOROUSLY TO MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCING STATUTES': '\"[T]he rule of lenity[] teach[es] that ambiguities \\nabout the breadth of a cri minal statute should be \\nresolved in the defendant\\'s favor.\"  United States v. \\nDavis , 139 S. Ct. 2319, 2333 ( 2019).  That rule has \\nfamously been described as \"\\'perhaps not much less old than\\' the task of statut ory \\'construction itself.\\'\"  \\nId. (quoting United States v. Wiltberger , 18 U.S.  \\n(5 Wheat.) 76, 95 (1820) (Marshall, C.J.)).   \\nAt its core the rule of le nity is an understanding \\nthat \"a fair warning should be given to the world in \\nlanguage that the common world will understand,  \\nof what the law intends to  do if a certain line is \\npassed,\" and that, \"[t]o make  the warning fair, so far \\nas possible the line sh ould be clear.\"  McBoyle v. \\nUnited States , 283 U.S. 25, 27 (1931) (Holmes, J.).  In \\naddition, judicial adherence to the rule of lenity also \"places the weight of inertia upon the party\" – that \\nis, the executive branch – \"that can best induce \\nCongress to speak more clearly and keeps courts \\n 7 \\nfrom making criminal law in Congress\\'s stead.\"  \\nUnited States v. Santos , 553 U.S. 507, 514 (2008) \\n(plurality); see Bell v. United States , 349 U.S. 81, 83 \\n(1955) (Frankfurter, J.) (\" When Congress leaves to \\nthe Judiciary the task of imputing to Congress an \\nundeclared will, the ambiguity should be resolved in \\nfavor of lenity.\"). \\nIn several cases involving mandatory minimum \\nsentencing provisions, the Court has recognized and \\napplied the \"presupposition . . . [that] doubts in the enforcement of a penal code\" should be \"resolve[d] . . . \\nagainst the imposition of a harsher punishment.\"  Bell, 349 U.S. at 83.  Examples include Davis , which \\ninvoked lenity to reject a broader saving construction of a different provision of the same mandatory mini-\\nmum statute at issue here, see 139 S. Ct. at 2333; \\nBurrage v. United States , 571 U.S. 204 (2014), which \\ndescribed a 15-year mandat ory minimum statute as \\n\"a criminal statute subject to the rule of lenity,\" and \\nlenity as a reason the Court \"[e]specially\" could not \\ndepart from the \"ordinary,  accepted meaning\" of  \\n\"the [statutory] text,\" id. at 216; and United States  \\nv. Granderson , 511 U.S. 39 (1994), which \"appl[ied] \\nthe rule of lenity\" to \"resolve [an] ambiguity\" in a \"mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment\" \\nafter revocation of probation, id. at 56-57.  Those \\ndecisions cohere with others explaining that the rule of lenity assists \"not only to resolve issues about the \\nsubstantive scope of criminal statutes, but to answer questions about the severity of sentencing.\"  United \\nStates v. R.L.C. , 503 U.S. 291, 306 (1992) (plurality) \\n(citing Bifulco v. United States , 447 U.S. 381, 387 \\n(1980) (collecting cases)). \\nIndeed, especially good reasons warrant applying \\nthe rule of lenity rigorously to statutes that, like the \\nACCA, create aggravated offenses with mandatory \\n 8 \\nminimum sentences.  A broad construction bars \\njudges from tailoring the sentence to the offense and \\nthe offender, leading to particularly harsh conse-\\nquences that only Congress can correct.  A narrower \\nconstruction, by contrast, does not prevent judges \\nfrom imposing longer sentences where necessary.  \\n\"These interpretive asymmetries give the rule of \\nlenity special force in the context of mandatory \\nminimum provisions.\"  Dean v. United States , 556 \\nU.S. 568, 585 (2009) (Breyer, J., dissenting). \\nFurther, experience shows that mandatory mini-\\nmum statutes frequently present difficult problems \\nof statutory construction, creating a heightened risk \\nthat courts will read them to impose sentences that \\nCongress never intended.  Wh ere, as here, an unclear \\nstatute presents a palpable risk of error, courts \\nproperly refuse to \"condemn a man to a minimum of \\n15 years in prison on the basis of . . . speculation,\" \\nBegay v. United States , 553 U.S. 137, 154 (2008) \\n(Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment), about what \\nCongress meant to say.'}\n",
      "{'A. The Rule of Lenity Helps Avoid the Particularly High Costs of Reading Mandatory Minimums Too Broadly': '1. The costs of erroneously construing mandatory \\nminimum sentencing provisions too broadly are especially high, and the costs of construing them too \\nnarrowly are especially low.  The greatest cost of \\nreading a mandatory minimu m too broadly is that \\nindividual defendants lose  their liberty.  Mandatory \\nminimum provisions are, by design, severe.  They \\noften tie an additional prison sentence of years or \\ndecades (here, a decade and a half) to a single factual \\ndetermination.  Such provisions therefore speak to \\nthe core concern that has motivated courts to apply \\nthe rule of lenity for centuries:  the \"instinctive \\n 9 \\ndistaste[] against men lang uishing in prison unless \\nthe lawmaker has clearly sa id they should.\"  Henry \\nJ. Friendly, \"Mr. Justice Frankfurter and the Reading of Statutes,\" in Benchmarks  196, 209 (1967), \\nquoted in United States v. Bass , 404 U.S. 336, 348 \\n(1971).  Because of that concern, this Court \"will not \\ninterpret a federal criminal statute so as to increase \\nthe penalty that it places on an individual when such \\nan interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what Congress intended.\"  Ladner v. \\nUnited States , 358 U.S. 169, 178 (1958). \\nFurther, mandatory minimum provisions often are \\nsaid to reflect (at least in theory) the moral judgment \\nof the community that particular conduct deserves \\nharsher punishment.  In our system of government, \\nthat judgment is reserved to the legislature.  The \\nrule of lenity ensures that criminal sentences \\nactually reflect legislative judgment, rather than \\nguesswork by the courts abo ut what the legislature \\nmeant.  See Granderson , 511 U.S. at 69 (Kennedy, J., \\nconcurring in the judgment) (\"\\'[B]ecause criminal punishment usually represents the moral condemna-\\ntion of the community, legislatures and not courts \\nshould define criminal activity,\\' and set the punish-\\nments therefor.\") (quoting Bass , 404 U.S. at 348) \\n(citation omitted); R.L.C. , 503 U.S. at 309 (Scalia, J., \\nconcurring in part and co ncurring in the judgment) \\n(describing one of \"the rule of lenity\\'s . . . purpose[s]\" \\nas \"assuring that the society, through its represen-\\ntatives, has genuinely called for the punishment to \\nbe meted out\"); Wiltberger , 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) at 95 \\n(explaining that \"[t]he rule that penal laws are to  be construed strictly\" is  founded not merely on \\n\"tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals\" \\nbut also on the \"plain principle that the power of \\n 10 \\npunishment is vested in the legislative, not in the \\njudicial department\"). \\nAny criminal statute presents these concerns,  \\nbut mandatory minimum provisions make them \\nparticularly weighty.  Unlike other criminal laws, \\nmandatory minimums are exceptions to the principle \\nthat courts should \"impose a sentence sufficient,  \\nbut not greater than necessary,\" to accomplish the goals of criminal punishme nt after considering  \\n\"the nature and circumstances of the offense and  \\nthe history and characteristics of the defendant.\"   \\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1).  A mandatory minimum is a \\ncongressional directive to subordinate justice in \\nindividual cases to a perceived need for greater \\ndeterrence or incapacitation generally.  Congress may choose to make that tradeoff (within constitu-\\ntional bounds), but the courts should ensure that \\nCongress has actually made that choice before \\nimposing needlessly harsh punishments.  Cf. Busic  \\nv. United States , 446 U.S. 398, 408-09 (1980) \\n(interpreting a sentencing enhancement; rejecting the \"assumption that . . . Congress\\' sole objective  \\nwas to increase the penalties . . . to the maximum \\nextent possible\"). \\n2. The adverse consequences of erroneously \\nexpanding mandatory sentencing beyond the limits of congressional intent affect more than just \\nindividual defendants.  Such errors strike at the \\nfoundations of the sentencing system by under-\\nmining \"sentencing proportionality – a key element of sentencing fairness.\"  Harris v. United States , 536 \\nU.S. 545, 570-71 (2002) (Breye r, J., concurring in \\npart and concurring in the judgment), overruled by \\nAlleyne v. United States , 570 U.S. 99 (2013).  As the \\nSentencing Commission – quoted with approval by this Court – has explained:  \"\\'The \"cliffs\" that result \\n 11 \\nfrom mandatory minimums compromise proportion-\\nality, a fundamental prem ise for just punishment, \\nand a primary goal of the Sentencing Reform Act.\\'\"  Neal v. United States , 516 U.S. 284, 291-92 (1996) \\n(quoting United States Sentencing Comm\\'n, Special \\nReport to the Congress:  Mandatory Minimum \\nPenalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System  iii \\n(Aug. 1991)). \\nFurther, the rule of leni ty historically has been \\njustified in part based on the \"principle of legality\":  conduct can be criminalized , and penalties author-\\nized, only by legislative action, so \"that the amount  \\nof discretion entrusted to those who enforce the law \\ndoes not exceed tolerable lim its.\"  Herbert L. Packer, \\nThe Limits of the Criminal Sanction  93 (1968).  As \\nthe Court put it in Marinello v. United States , 138 S. \\nCt. 1101 (2018), \"prosecutorial discretion\" to enforce \\na statute with \"wide-rangin g scope . . . places great \\npower in the hands of the prosecutor,\" creating risks of \"nonuniform execution\" and \"arbitary prosecution.\"  \\nId. at 1108-09.  That concern is one reason for  \\nthe Court\\'s \"\\'traditional[] exercise[]\\'\" of \"\\'restraint in \\nassessing the reach of a federal criminal statute.\\'\"  Id. at 1109 (quoting United States v. Aguilar , 515 \\nU.S. 593, 600 (1995)).  And it is a special problem \\nwith mandatory minimums that effectively transfer \\nsentencing discretion from the trial judge, \"the one \\nactor in the system most ex perienced with exercising \\ndiscretion,\" to \"an assistant prosecutor not trained in \\nthe exercise of discretion.\"   An Address by Anthony \\nM. Kennedy, Associate Justic e, Supreme Court of the \\nUnited States, Speech at the American Bar Associ-\\nation Annual Meeting (Aug. 9, 2003), available at  \\nhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/speeches/sp_08-09-03.html. \\n 12 \\nInconsistently exercised discretion means that, in \\npractice, mandatory minimums fail to yield even \\nuniformity in sentencing – the benefit they are \\nsupposed to obtain at the cost of individual justice \\nand proportionality.  Over decades, the Sentencing \\nCommission has repeatedly reported \"inconsisten[cy]\" \\nand \"wide geographic variations\" in the use of mandatory minimum sentences.  E.g., United States \\nSentencing Comm\\'n, Application and Impact of  \\n21 U.S.C. § 851:  Enhanced  Penalties for Federal \\nDrug Trafficking Offenders  6 (July 2018) (finding \\n\"significant variation in the extent to which . . . enhanced penalties were sought against eligible \\noffenders\"); see also United States v. Angelos , 345  \\nF. Supp. 2d 1227, 1252 (D. Utah 2004) (discussing \\n\"the potential for tremendous sentencing disparity if \\nfederal prosecutors across th e country do not uniformly \\ncharge . . . violations\" of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)), aff\\'d , 433 \\nF.3d 738 (10th Cir. 2006).\\n2   \\n                                                 \\n2 See also  United States Sentencing Comm\\'n, Mandatory \\nMinimum Penalties for Sex Offenses in the Federal Criminal \\nJustice System  56 (Jan. 2019) (finding that, \"[i]n fiscal year \\n2016, the mandatory minimum penalty for receipt [of child por-nography] [wa]s inconsistently applied,\" leading to \"substantial\" \\ndifferences in sentences where \"the conduct involved in the  \\noffenses was not meaningfully distinguishable\"); United States Sentencing Comm\\'n, Report to Congress:  Mandatory Minimum \\nPenalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System  345 (Oct. \\n2011) (\"2011 Report\") (finding \"inconsistencies in application  \\nof certain mandatory minimum penalties, as shown by . . .  \\ndata analyses and confirmed by interviews of prosecutors and \\ndefense attorneys\"); United States Sentencing Comm\\'n, Fifteen \\nYears of Guidelines Sentencing:  An Assessment of How Well  \\nthe Federal Criminal Justice System is Achieving the Goals  of Sentencing Reform  89 (Nov. 2004) (\"Research over the past \\nfifteen years has consistently found that mandatory penalty \\nstatutes are used inconsistently in cases in which they appear \\nto apply.\"). \\n 13 \\nIndeed, over the last two decades, different \\nAttorneys General have instructed federal prose-\\ncutors differently on how to use mandatory minimum \\nstatutes, switching between more- and less-aggressive \\napproaches.3  In adopting such policies, the executive \\nbranch takes into its own hands the tradeoff between \\nsentencing uniformity, on the one hand, and \\nindividual justice and proportionality, on the other.  Whatever the wisdom of the competing approaches, \\nthat practice emphasizes how mandatory minimum \\nstatutes transfer power over  individual liberty from \\nlawmakers and judges to pr osecutors.  In our adver-\\nsarial system, moreover, pr osecutors can and do use \\nthat power strategically in ways that undermine \\nstructural protections for individual liberties, such as by using the threat of a mandatory minimum to \\nobtain a guilty plea.  See United States v. Kupa ,  \\n976 F. Supp. 2d 417, 420 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) \\n(condemning the practice of \"coerc[ing] guilty pleas, \\nand sometimes . . . coerc[ing] cooperation as well,  \\n[by] routinely threaten[ing] ultra-harsh, enhanced mandatory sentences that no one  – not even the \\nprosecutors themselves – thinks are appropriate\") \\n(footnote omitted),  aff \\'d, 616 F. App\\'x 33  (2d Cir. 2015) . \\n                                                 \\n3 See Angelos , 345 F. Supp. 2d at 1253 & n.120 (discussing a \\n2003 memorandum intended \"to reduce charging disparities \\nstemming from § 924(c)\"); United States Sentencing Comm\\'n, \\nAn Overview of Mandatory Minim um Penalties in the Federal \\nCriminal Justice System 24-25 (July 2017) (comparing the 2013 \\n\"Smart on Crime\" initiative, which outlined circumstances  \\nin which prosecutors should \"\\'decline to charge\\'\" mandatory \\nminimum sentences, to \"revised guidance\" in 2017 directing \\nprosecutors generally to \"\\'charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense,\\'\" with seriousness measured by the \\ngreatest sentence, \" \\'including mandatory minimum sentences\\' \"). \\n 14 \\nNor does the expansion of prosecutorial power \\nthrough mandatory minimum statutes stop at the \\ncharging stage.  Even after conviction, the prosecutor \\nholds an important key to lessening the effect of a \\nmandatory minimum sentence.  A district court is \\nfreed from restrictions on its sentencing discretion \\n\"[u]pon motion of the Government . . . so as to reflect \\na defendant\\'s substantial assistance in the investi-gation or prosecution of another person,\" 18 U.S.C. \\n§ 3553(e), or it can similarly reduce the sentence \\nlater, again with the government\\'s approval, under \\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b)(4).\\n4  Suc h \\ndiscretionary motions have large effects on \\nsentences, often reducing them by many years.5  \\nResearch has found \"enorm ous differences in how \\nprosecutors exercise that di scretion, with substantial \\nvariation by district.\"6  Again, within broad constitu-\\ntional bounds, Congress has the power to create such \\na system.  But the Court need not and should not \\nbroaden more than Congress\\'s language requires \\n                                                 \\n4 In certain cases involving no n-violent drug offenders, a  \\ndistrict judge may invoke 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f), often called a  \\njudicial \"safety valve,\" but the sa fety valve is \"narrow\" and still \\nrequires prosecutorial approval in substance if not in form.   \\nRachel E. Barkow, Categorical Mistakes:  The Flawed Frame-\\nwork of the Armed Career Criminal Act and Mandatory Mini-\\nmum Sentencing , 133 Harv. L. Rev. 200, 218 (2019). \\n5 See United States Sentencing Comm\\'n,  Mandatory Minimum \\nPenalties for Firearms Offenses in the Federal Criminal Justice \\nSystem 42 (Mar. 2018)  (\"In fiscal year 2016, the average sentence \\nfor offenders who remained subject to the mandatory minimum \\npenalty [under § 924(e)] at sentencing was 200 months, signifi-cantly longer than the average sentence for offenders relieved of \\nthis mandatory minimum penalty (112 months).\"). \\n6 Barkow, Categorical Mistakes , 133 Harv.

By contrast, the costs of erroneously \\nconstruing a mandatory minimum provision too \\nnarrowly are relatively low, both for individual cases \\nand for the criminal justice system as a whole.  In \\ncases that fall outside the scope of a mandatory \\nminimum, but that nevertheless feature aggravating \\ncircumstances similar to those that moved Congress \\nto impose the minimum, a sentencing judge still has discretion (guided by § 3553(a) and the sentencing \\nguidelines) to impose a more severe sentence.  As Justice Breyer explained in Dean , \"an interpretive \\nerror on the side of leniency[] still permits  the \\nsentencing judge to impose a sentence similar to, \\nperhaps close to, the statutor y sentence even if that \\nsentence . . . is not legislatively required .\"  556 U.S. \\nat 584 (Breyer, J., dissenting). \\nMoreover, \"an error that excludes (erroneously) a \\nset of instances Congress me ant to include . . . could \\nlead the Sentencing Commission to focus on those cases . . . [and] make avail able to Congress a body of \\nevidence and analysis that w ill help it reconsider the \\nstatute.\"  Id. at 585.  Those who bring actions under \\nthe criminal laws (the executive branch) have far greater access to thos e who create them (the \\nlegislative branch) than do those who defend against \\nsuch actions (potential criminal defendants).  In light \\nof this practical reality, the rule of lenity \"places the \\nweight of inertia upon the party that can best induce \\nCongress to speak more clearly.\"  Santos , 553 U.S. at \\n514 (plurality).  \\n 16'}\n",
      "{'B. The Risk of Reading Mandatory Minimums Too Broadly Is Also Particularly High': 'The risk of mistaking congressional intent is also \\nunusually high in the case of mandatory minimum \\nprovisions.  Those provisions often do not originate \\nfrom a careful and considered drafting process.   \\nThe history of the \"occasions different from one \\nanother\" language of § 924(e) (1) is a good example:  \\nas petitioner shows in detail, that language stemmed \\nfrom then-Solicitor-General  Fried\\'s confession of \\nerror to this Court in Petty v. United States , 481 U.S. \\n1034 (1987) (No. 86-6263).  In that case, the United States candidly admitted that the different-occasions \\nlanguage, present in \"other enhanced penalty \\nprovisions,\" was omitted from the predecessor to \\n§ 924(e)(1), even though the legislative history \\nshowed \"that both Congress and those supporting the legislation, including the Department of Justice, did \\nnot intend that the penalty provision would apply \\nmore broadly than in the case of the other federal \\nenhanced penalty statutes.\"   Pet. Br. App. 25a-26a; \\nsee id.  at 26a-31a. \\nHad the United States not taken the unusual step \\nof confessing error in Petty , the courts might well \\nhave concluded – as the Eighth Circuit already had –that Congress had intentionally left the different-occasions language out of th e statute.  After all,  \\nas the Solicitor General\\'s brief pointed out, courts \\nconstruing statutes often draw a \"negative implica-\\ntion\" from the omission of  language in one statute \\nthat is present in anot her, similar statute.  Id. at  \\n26a (citing Rodriguez v. United States , 480 U.S. 522, \\n525 (1987) (per curiam)).  An d courts reaching that \\nconclusion would have imposed minimum 15-year \\nsentences, not based on a \"genuine[] call[] for th[at] \\n 17 \\npunishment\" by \"society[\\'s] . . . representatives,\" R.L.C. , \\n503 U.S. at 309 (Scalia, J., concurrring in part and concurring in the judgment), but based on a slip of the legislative pen. \\nThere are other examples.  Indeed, § 924(e) \\npresents one:  its \"residual clause\" defined a \"violent \\nfelony\" to include any felony that \"involves conduct \\nthat presents a serious potential risk of physical \\ninjury.\"  18 U.S.C. § 924( e)(2)(B)(ii).  This Court \\nstruck that clause down as unconstitutionally vague \\nin Johnson v. United States , 576 U.S. 591 (2015), \\nrelying in part on \"[n]ine years\\' experience trying to derive meaning from the residual clause\" as evidence \\nthat the courts had \"embarked upon a failed enterprise.\"  Id. at 601-02.  And the Court reached \\nthe same conclusion in Davis as to § 924(e)\\'s cousin \\n§ 924(c), striking down a similarly vague clause that \\ntriggered mandatory minimum sentences of 5, 7, 10, and 25 years.  See 139 S. Ct. at 2325, 2336. \\nIn United States v. O\\'Brien , 560 U.S. 218 (2010), \\nthe Court described as \" unclear\" yet another provi-\\nsion of § 924(c) that i mposed a 30-year mandatory \\nminimum sentence for possessing a machinegun \\nwhile committing certain crimes.  Id. at 227, 229.  \\nFacing that lack of clarity, the Court applied a  five-factor test to determine whether machinegun \\npossession was intended to be an offense element  or as a sentencing factor.  See id. at 227-32.  In \\nGranderson , the Court diplomatically observed that \\n18 U.S.C. § 3565(a), imposi ng a mandatory minimum \\nsentence for certain revocations of parole, did not \\n\"appear[] . . . to have received Congress\\' careful \\nattention.\"  511 U.S. at 42.  Justice Scalia less \\ndiplomatically called § 3565(a) \"wretchedly drafted.\"  \\nId. at 60 (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment). \\n 18 \\nThe Court\\'s repeated struggles with opaque text \\nand structure in mandatory minimum provisions  \\nare the kind of \"experience\"  that is \"the life of the \\nlaw.\"  Johnson , 576 U.S. at 601.  That experience \\nteaches that mandatory minimum sentencing statutes, including the one at issue here, commonly \\nuse \"sweeping and imprecise language\" that \"set[s] \\nup a host of vexing constitutional and statutory \\ninterpretation questions for the courts.\"  Barkow, \\nCategorical Mistakes , 133 Harv. L. Rev. at 202.   \\nThe rule of lenity, \"as a so rt of \\'junior version of  \\nthe vagueness doctrine,\\'\" United States v. Lanier , \\n520 U.S. 259, 266 (1997) (quoting Packer, Criminal \\nSanction  at 95), is a useful doctrinal approach to \\nanswering those questions.  If the Court finds the \\nstatute now before it ambiguous, lenity can help – \\nand an emphasis on lenity in the context of \\nmandatory minimum statutes can help guide the \\nlower courts to solve futu re, similar problems that \\nwill inevitably arrive.\\n7 \\n                                                 \\n7 Some have stated that \"a court must find not just ambiguity \\nbut \\'grievous ambiguity\\' before resorting to the rule of lenity.\"  \\nShular v. United States , 140 S. Ct. 779, 788 & n.2 (2020)  \\n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (collecting examples).  Other recent decisions, drawing on a long line of authority, have applied \\nprinciples of lenity without the adjective \"grievous.\"  See, e.g., \\nDavis , 139 S. Ct. at 2333 (invoking lenity where \"a criminal \\nstatute . . . d[id] not clearly proscribe\" conduct and stating that \\n\"ambiguities about the breadth of a criminal statute should  be resolved in the defendant\\'s favor\").  The notion that lenity \\napplies only in cases of \"grievous ambiguity\" appeared in this \\nCourt\\'s cases relatively recently.  See Chapman v. United \\nStates , 500 U.S. 453, 463 (1991) (quoting Huddleston v. United \\nStates , 415 U.S. 814, 831 (1974), which had stated that the \\nCourt \"perceive[d] no grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in\" a \\nstatute before it, id., but did not suggest that \"grievous ambigu-\\nity\" was a threshold requirement for any reliance on lenity).  \\nThe rule of lenity itself goes back for centuries.  In any event, \\n 19'}\n",
      "{'II. JUDICIAL EXPERIENCE WITH 18 U.S.C. section 924(e)(1) SUPPORTS APPLYING THE RULE OF LENITY': 'Petitioner\\'s brief ably sets forth why the Sixth \\nCircuit\\'s analysis finds no support in the ACCA\\'s \\ntext, history, or purpose.  FAMM agrees that this \\nCourt can and should reverse the judgment of the \\nSixth Circuit without resort to the rule of lenity or the principles that underlie it.  If the Court finds the \\nquestion close, however, it may help to consider \\njudicial experience applying the same standard that \\nthe Sixth Circuit applied here.  Examining that \\nexperience counsels in favor of lenity. \\nThat experience shows that the approach of the \\ncourt of appeals – asking wh ether \"it [is] possible to \\ndiscern the point at which the first offense is \\ncompleted and the subsequent point at which the \\nsecond offense begins,\" JA22 – does not satisfy this \\nCourt\\'s teaching that \"so far as possible the line should be clear.\"  McBoyle , 283 U.S. at 27.  Nor does \\nthat test align, in any way \"the common world will \\nunderstand,\" id., with Congress\\'s effo rt to classify as \\nan armed career criminal someone who has \"three previous convictions . . . for a violent felony or a \\nserious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions \\ndifferent from one another, \" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1).  \\nInstead, the temporal-sequencing test is at best \"no \\nmore than a guess as to what Congress intended,\" \\nLadner , 358 U.S. at 178 – a guess that produces \\narbitrary and unpredictable results. \\n                                                                                                   \\nwhere all the tools of statutory construction fail to resolve genu-\\nine ambiguity as to whether Congress has demanded a manda-\\ntory prison term, that ambiguity can fairly be called \"grievous.\" \\n 20'}\n",
      "{'A. Entries of Separate Structures on a Single Day or Night Are Not Clearly Multiple Different \"Occasions\"': '1. The decision under review  is a useful starting \\npoint.  According to the Sixth Circuit, all 10 of Wooden\\'s 1997 convictions for burglary, which took \\nplace on a single night, were \"separate ACCA \\npredicate offenses\" that occurred on \"\\'occasions \\ndifferent from one another.\\'\"  JA21 (quoting 18 \\nU.S.C. § 924(e)(1)).  To support that conclusion, the court of appeals reasoned that, \"[w]hatever the \\ncontours of a \\'mini\\' wareho use, Wooden could not be \\nin two (let alone ten) of them  at once\"; that he \"could \\nhave ceased his criminal conduct\" after entering the \\nfirst warehouse without en tering nine more; and \\nthat, although \"one could characterize th[e] cluster of \\nwarehouses as being adjoined \\'at the same business location,\\'\" they were \"different locations\" because  \\ntheir owners had \"distinct se ts of property rights.\"  \\nJA23-24. \\nWooden argues persuasively (at 30) that the \\n\"textual foundations\" for the court of appeals\\' \"test \\n. . . are essentially nonexistent.\"  Even if the statute \\ndoes not wholly foreclose th at test, it certainly gives \\nno fair warning that unlawfully entering 10 small \\nwarehouses within the same building on a single \\nevening triggers a harsh 15-year penalty for later \\nowning a gun, while spending the same amount  \\nof time in a single warehouse would not.  The court  \\nof appeals\\' analysis thus  \"mak[es] criminal law  \\nin Congress\\'s stead.\"  Santos , 553 U.S. at 514 \\n(plurality).  At best it is judicial doctrine built up  \\nto cover the lack of clarity in the statute, rather  \\nthan anything that can claim to be an application of \\nthe statute itself.  Those who agree with Justice \\nScalia that \"it is not consistent with the rule of lenity \\n 21 \\nto construe a textually ambiguous penal statute \\nagainst a criminal defendant on the basis of legis-\\nlative history,\" R.L.C. , 503 U.S. at 307 (Scalia, J., \\nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment), \\ncan stop there, because the statute is at least \\ntextually ambiguous.   \\nThose who look to legislative history as an \\ninterpretive guide should reach the same ultimate \\nconclusion.  As Wooden persuasively shows (at 21-\\n25), that history ranges fr om an Assistant Attorney \\nGeneral\\'s 1984 testimony that the statute was meant \\nto catch \"people who have demonstrated . . . that \\nlocking them up and letting them go doesn\\'t do any \\ngood,\" Pet. Br. Add. 29a; to the Solicitor General\\'s 1987 concession in Petty that the statute was \\n\"intended\" to cover \"multiple criminal episodes,\" id. \\nat 26a; to then-Senator Biden\\'s 1988 statement that \\nthe statute was meant to \"express[] [a] concept of \\nwhat is meant by a \\'career criminal,\\'\" 134 Cong. Rec. S17,370 (daily ed. Nov. 10, 1988).  None of this \\nsuggests an intent – let alone a clear one – to \\nconsider multiple offenses on a single night to be a \\ncareer in crime because it took a few seconds to move \\nfrom one mini-warehouse to another within a cluster \\nof such warehouses. \\n2. The Fourth Circuit\\'s decision in United States \\nv. Carr , 592 F.3d 636 (4th Cir. 2010), illustrates the \\nsame point.  That case involved Daryl Carr, who possessed a firearm after previously pleading guilty \\nto 13 state-law charges of \"felony breaking or entering.\"  Id. at 638.  Those 13 offenses all took \\nplace on a single day in 2006 during which Carr broke into each of 13 \"different storage unit[s]\" at  \\nthe same street addres s (\"N.C. 32 South\").  Id.  The \\ncourt of appeals conceded that the offenses were \\n\"substantively the same and arguably had the same \\n 22 \\ncriminal objective,\" but it nevertheless found them  \\nto be \"separate and distinct criminal episodes.\"  Id.  \\nat 645.  It reasoned that  the storage units were \\n\"different locations\"; that mo st, though not all, of the \\noffenses had \"different victims\"; and that Carr \"had \\nthe opportunity . . . to cease and desist his criminal \\nbehavior\" between one storage unit and the next, \\nadding in a footnote that \"Carr simply could not have \\nbroken into or entered the 13 separate storage units simultaneously.\"  Id. at 645 & n.8 (citation omitted).\\n8 \\nIn that analysis, the Fourth Circuit asserted that \\nthe statutory \"\\'definition may be clear\\'\" but conceded \\nthat \"\\'the factual permutations surrounding the \\nACCA tend to create havoc\\'\"; that \"\\'courts have \\napplied a multiplicity of factors\\'\" in cases involving \\n§ 924(e); and that the \"analysis\" has a \"fluid nature.\"  Id. at 640 (quoting United States v. Letterlough ,  \\n63 F.3d 332, 335 (4th Cir.  1995)).  That sort of \\nassessment ought to be a warning sign in construing a criminal statute:  it calls to mind this Court\\'s \\nobservation in Johnson that \"pervasive disagreement \\nabout the nature of the inquiry one is supposed to \\nconduct and the kinds of factors one is supposed to \\nconsider\" is a sign of unacceptable vagueness.  576 \\nU.S. at 601.  The present case, to be sure, is not  \\na vagueness challenge.  But the rule of lenity – and  \\nthe \"constitutional principles underlying th[at] rule,\" \\nDavis , 139 S. Ct. at 2333 n. 8 – counsels against \\nadopting a line of authority whose own proponents \\nreport fluidity at best and havoc at worst. \\n                                                 \\n8 In another footnote, the Fourth Circuit noted that Carr had \\nother \"state convictions\" on different dates, at least one of which \\ninvolved \"assault by pointing a gun,\" Carr , 592 F.3d at 639 n.3, \\nbut did not analyze whether they  constituted ACCA predicates \\nor rely on them for its holding. \\n 23 \\n3. The Seventh Circuit\\'s decision in United States \\nv. Hudspeth , 42 F.3d 1015 (7th Cir. 1994) (en banc), \\ninvolved Thomas Hudspeth, who on one day in 1983 broke into three businesses – \"a doughnut shop, a dry \\ncleaners, and an insurance company.\"  Id. at 1018-19.  \\nThe businesses were in the same \"strip mall,\" id., \\nwhere the burglars made \"a hole through [a] shared wall\" and \"forced open the door\" connecting two of \\nthe businesses, id. at 1022.  The whole affair took \\n\"approximately thirty-five minutes.\"  Id. at 1018-19.  \\nA majority of the Seventh Circuit held that, because Hudspeth\\'s three offenses were \"committed sequen-\\ntially, against different victims, at different times, \\nand at different locations,\" they were \"clearly crimes \\n\\'committed on occasions different from one another.\\'\"  Id. at 1021. \\nOne concurrence reasoned that Hudspeth was \\n\"appropriately sentenced because . . . the record shows three separate crimes against separate victims \\nand not a single crime or criminal occasion (whatever that is).\"  Id. at 1025 (Bauer, J., concurring).  One \\npartial dissent noted that past decisions had \"grappl[ed] with the ambi guity of the ACCA\" and \\nnoted \"the malleability of the relevant terms,\" including the different-occasions language.  Id. at \\n1025-26 (Flaum, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Another, joined by  five of the 11 judges who \\nheard the case, agreed that the \"cold print of the \\nstatute books\" did not answ er the question before  \\nthe court and argued for interpreting § 924(e) as  \\na \"congressional mandate . . . to identify the true recidivist.\"  Id. at 1034, 1037 (Ripple, J., concurring \\nin part and dissenting in part).  \\nNone of the opinions in Hudspeth suggested \\napplying the rule of lenity.  Yet at least six members \\n 24 \\nof the en banc court – counting Judge Bauer, whose \\nconcurrence expressed marked frustration with the \\nstatutory language – appear to have found no answer \\nto the question before them in § 924(e).9  As judicial \\nexperience goes, that is further evidence that \\n\"Congress le[ft] to the Judiciary the task of imputing \\nto Congress an undeclared will,\" Bell, 349 U.S. at 83, \\nconcerning prior offenses that occur over a short \\nperiod of time in several adjacent structures.'}\n",
      "{'B. Evading or Resisting Arrest Does Not Clearly Involve Multiple Different \"Occasions\"': 'Another  situation that repeatedly arises under \\n§ 924(e) is an offense af ter which the defendant \\nevades or resists arrest.  A rule that focuses on \\nsequence in time treats evasion or resistance as a \\ndifferent \"occasion,\" because it is possible to imagine a point at which the defendant stops the first offense \\nand starts running.  But an ordinary person trying  \\nto figure out the meaning of the statute from its \\nwords would not likely reach that conclusion.  Nor  \\ndo the tools of statutory construction suggest that \\nCongress meant to treat such an offender as a career \\ncriminal deserving 15 years in prison. \\n1. In United States v. Schieman , 894 F.2d 909 \\n(7th Cir. 1990), David Schi eman received a 15-year \\nsentence based in part on prior convictions of \\nburglary and aggravated batte ry of a police officer.  \\nId. at 910.  As a partial dissent explained:  \\n                                                 \\n9 Hudspeth relied on police reports to determine the circum-\\nstances of prior offenses; Shepard v. United States , 544 U.S. 13, \\n16 (2005), later barred courts from considering police reports  \\nin applying § 924(e).  The Seventh Circuit has since cited  \\nHudspeth as \"abrogated\" at least in part by Shepard .  See, e.g., \\nUnited States v. Elliott , 703 F.3d 378, 384 n.3 (7th Cir. 2012). \\n 25 \\nSchieman committed a robbery, walked three \\nblocks away to make a telephone call [at a phone \\nbooth] to arrange transportation away from the \\nscene, and, in an attempt to evade apprehension, \\npushed a police officer at the phone booth.  The \\npushing incident occurred approximately five \\nminutes after the robbery. \\nId. at 913 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and \\ndissenting in part).  The majority reasoned that, \"[o]nce the original crime is complete, there is no \\nprincipled way to distinguish\" between a battery \\n\"within ten minutes of the burglary\" and one \"a day after the burglary.\"  Id. at  913 (majority). \\nOne giving the words \"different\" and \"occasion\" \\ntheir ordinary meaning might well think that both \\nSchieman\\'s burglary and his attempt to escape five \\nminutes later occurred on the same occasion.  One \\nthinking of the statute as an attempt to identify \\ncareer criminals would reach the same result.  And \\nthe Schieman court\\'s reasoning only emphasizes  \\nhow traditional principles of lenity support that conclusion.  The court took a case it thought clear \\n(escape a day later) and used it to resolve a case  \\nit thought unclear (escape five minutes later) by \\narguing the lack of a \"principled . . . distin[ction]\" \\nbetween the two.  But the felt need to invoke the day-after hypothetical itself shows that the statute does \\nnot speak clearly to the five -minute case.  The court\\'s \\nrole was therefore to limit the 15-year sanction to the \\ncase where it was unambiguously intended. \\n2. In United States v. Davidson , 527 F.3d 703 \\n(8th Cir. 2008), vacated in part on other grounds , 551 \\nF.3d 807 (8th Cir. 2008) (per curiam), Mark Davidson \\nwas sentenced under § 924(e)  based on prior convic-\\ntions that included an attempted domestic assault \\n 26 \\nand fleeing from a police officer who interrupted that \\nattempt with a traffic stop.  Id. at 707.  The Seventh \\nCircuit conceded that the \"pause between the two offenses was brief\" and that the crimes were \\ncommitted in \"rapid succession,\" but reasoned that  \\na \"moment of relative calm\" had occurred when  \\nthe officer stopped Davidson, creating \"a point of \\ndemarcation between episodes\" that justified treating \\nDavidson\\'s prior convictions as separate.  Id. at 710. \\nThe Davidson court candidly acknowledged that \\nthe circuits had \"struggled with th[e] problem\" of applying § 924(e) to resist ance or evasion offenses, \\n\"reaching arguably inconsistent results,\" id. at 709, \\ndiscussing Schieman and other examples.  Considered \\nas an exercise in the common-law method, the \"point of demarcation\" analysis that Davidson derived \\nmight not be exceptional.  But it has been settled \\nsince United States v. Hudson , 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 32 \\n(1812), that \"federal crimes . . . are solely creatures of \\nstatute,\" Liparota v. United States , 471 U.S. 419, 424 \\n(1985), a principle that lenity helps protect, see id. at \\n427-28.  And the distinction that Davidson and cases \\nlike it draw – if it can even be squared with the \\nstatute at all – is clearly a rule made by the courts \\nrather than one set down by statute. \\n3. In Levering v. United States , 890 F.3d 738 (8th \\nCir. 2018), Merwyn Leveri ng was sentenced under \\n§ 924(e) based on prior convictions that included at \\nleast two assaults in the cour se of a high-speed flight \\nfrom police officers in a stolen automobile.  Id. at \\n739.  Levering argued that the assaults were not committed on different occasions because the flight \\nwas a \"\\'continuous course of conduct.\\'\"  Id. at 741.  \\nThe Eighth Circuit acknowledged that \"the phrase \\n\\'continuous course of conduct\\' appears in our cases on \\n 27 \\nthis subject,\" but rejected  it as \"unhelpful to the \\nanalysis.\"  Id. at 742.  Instead, the court relied on the \\nfact that the assaults were committed \"at different times in different counties against different victims.\"  \\nId.  The Eighth Circuit acknowledged that several \\nunpublished decisions from the Sixth Circuit pointed \\nto a different result, but \"respectfully differ[ed]\" with them.  Id.   \\nLike the Fourth Circuit\\'s acknowledgment of \"havoc\" \\nin Carr , the vigorous disagreement among members \\nof the Seventh Circuit in Hudspeth , and the Eighth \\nCircuit\\'s own earlier acknowledgment of \"arguabl[e] \\ninconsisten[cy]\" in Davidson , the reasoning of \\nLevering points to the type of pervasive uncertainty \\nabout statutory application that suggests courts have gone beyond the guidance that an unclear statute \\ncan offer.  It is especially  telling that – as the Eighth \\nCircuit\\'s criticism of the Sixth Circuit shows – courts theoretically applying the sa me sequential test reach \\ndifferent results as to similarly situated defendants. \\n4. None of this is to deny that fleeing from arrest \\nand assaulting someone while doing so is not serious misconduct that state and sometimes federal law \\nproperly criminalize.  The police officer in Schieman \\ncould have been hurt, as could the bystanders to the \\nhigh-speed chases in Davidson and Levering .  Nor is \\nthere any doubt that after their prior convictions the \\nvarious defendants were prohibited from possessing guns, see 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), and could be punished \\nfor breaking that law.  The function of § 924(e), \\nhowever – as its text, structure, and history all show – is to carve out a special set of repeat offenders, \\nlabeled as \"armed career criminals,\" for special \\ncondemnation and harsh mandatory punishment.  It \\nis impossible to read the cases struggling with these \\n 28 \\nissues and conclude that the legislature has \"clearly \\nsaid\" that those defendants should \"languish[] in \\nprison,\" Bass , 404 U.S. at 348 (cit ation omitted), for \\nat least 15 years.'}\n"

      "INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY \n",
      "I. The rule of lenity has an important role to  \n",
      "play in the interpretation of mandatory minimum sentencing statutes and shou ld be given special force \n",
      "in cases that involve them.  Mandatory minimum \n",
      "sentencing statutes pose special threats to individual liberty and the separation of powers.  Experience \n",
      "teaches that such statut e s  l e a d  t o  s e v e r e  a n d  \n",
      "disproportionate sentences, reallocate power from \n",
      "legislators and judges to prosecutors, and often \n",
      "ultimately fail to achieve their ostensible goal of \n",
      "sentencing uniformity.  Experience also teaches that \n",
      "such statutes are poorly drafted and difficult to \n",
      "apply.  Because the costs of overreading harsh \n",
      "sentencing statutes are high , lenity counsels in favor \n",
      "of narrower reading. \n",
      " 3 \n",
      "A. The most obvious cost of error in overreading a  \n",
      "mandatory minimum sentencing statute is the lost liberty of individuals who receive a far longer prison term than the legislature actually intended.  Lenity \n",
      "embodies the courts' \"instinctive distaste[] against \n",
      "men languishing in prison unless the lawmaker has \n",
      "clearly said they should.\"  Henry J. Friendly, \"Mr. \n",
      "Justice Frankfurter and the Reading of Statutes,\" in \n",
      "Benchmarks  196, 209 (1967).  A mandatory 15-year \n",
      "sentence based on less-than-certain evidence of \n",
      "legislative intent is indeed distasteful.  Mandatory \n",
      "minimum statutes like the one here also reflect moral condemnation for a special subgroup of criminals – as \n",
      "shown by Congress's decision to pass an \"Armed \n",
      "Career Criminal Act\" (\"ACCA\") – that should follow \n",
      "only from a genuine legislative decision. \n",
      "Mandatory minimum sentencing statutes also \n",
      "impair courts' efforts to achieve the important goals \n",
      "of fairness and proportionate punishment.  Although Congress has the power (within constitutional \n",
      "bounds) to sacrifice fairness and proportionality to a \n",
      "perceived greater good, courts should not conclude \n",
      "that Congress has done so based on guesswork or \n",
      "speculation about the meaning of an unclear statute.  \n",
      "Often, mandatory minimum sentencing statutes fail \n",
      "to achieve the goal of sentencing uniformity because they place great power in the hands of prosecutors, \n",
      "thus inviting inconsistent and arbitrary application.  \n",
      "Applying the rule of lenity rigorously to such statutes \n",
      "lessens those costs to the system and ensures that \n",
      "they are imposed only when Congress has truly \n",
      "found them justified. \n",
      "By contrast, erring on the side of narrow \n",
      "constructions for mandatory minimum statutes is \n",
      "less risky.  Most importantly, judges always retain \n",
      "power to sentence up to the statutory maximum or to \n",
      " 4 \n",
      "run sentences for multiple offenses consecutively.  \n",
      "They do not need mandatory minimums to determine \n",
      "appropriate sentences based on the nature of an \n",
      "offense or the history and characteristics of an \n",
      "offender.  Moreover, the go vernment is well situated \n",
      "to press for new legislation if dissatisfied with the \n",
      "courts' interpretation.  There is no reason to doubt \n",
      "that prosecutors will call for stronger criminal penalties in response to any true threat to public \n",
      "safety or that legislators will fail to answer such calls. \n",
      "B. The risk of error is particularly acute when \n",
      "courts interpret mandatory minimum sentencing statutes.  As this Court knows all too well, Congress \n",
      "often writes such statutes in a confusing way.  The \n",
      "statutory provision here resulted from a rare \n",
      "confession of error by the Solicitor General that, in \n",
      "essence, Congress had left needed language out of a 15-year sentencing statute and so had inflicted a \n",
      "harsher and broader penalty than anyone involved  \n",
      "in the statute's creation (the Justice Department \n",
      "included) had anticipated.  This Court's recent cases \n",
      "have invalidated other parts of § 924 as unconsti-\n",
      "tutionally vague, and over the years the Court has \n",
      "remarked on similar problems with other mandatory minimum sentencing statutes.  When Congress \n",
      "enacts mandatory minimum sentencing statutes  \n",
      "with enormous effects on future defendants, but \n",
      "gives little consideration to statutory details, the rule \n",
      "of lenity provides a much-needed safeguard for \n",
      "individual liberty. \n",
      "II. The rule of lenity confirms that this Court \n",
      "should reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.  \n",
      "Petitioner Wooden correctly argues that 18 U.S.C. \n",
      "§ 924(e) should be read in his favor even without the \n",
      "rule of lenity.  If any doubt remains, lenity should \n",
      "dispose of it.  That conclusion is further supported  \n",
      " 5 \n",
      "by examining judicial experience with cases under \n",
      "§ 924(e)(1).  The standard endorsed by the court of \n",
      "appeals – under which even a moment's separation \n",
      "between two prior offenses qualifies them as \n",
      "occurring on different occasions – has led to \n",
      "inconsistent results, arbitrary distinctions, and \n",
      "repeated judicial observations about confusion and \n",
      "uncertainty in the statutory scheme. \n",
      "A. One recurring type of situation involves \n",
      "burglaries of related or adjacent structures or dwellings.  Examples include the mini-warehouses at \n",
      "issue here; a group of adjacent storage units at the same street address in United States v. Carr , 592 \n",
      "F.3d 636 (4th Cir. 2010); and three businesses in a \n",
      "single strip mall in United States v. Hudspeth , 42 \n",
      "F.3d 1015 (7th Cir. 1994) (en banc), abrogated on \n",
      "other grounds by Shepard v. United States , 544 U.S. \n",
      "13 (2005).  Whether assessed against the constitu-tional right to fair warnin g or the legislature's sole \n",
      "responsibility under the Constitution to define \n",
      "crimes, the statute does no t clearly classify several \n",
      "break-ins in the course of a day or an hour as prior \n",
      "offenses on \"occasions different from one another.\"  \n",
      "Accordingly, the statute should not be construed to \n",
      "mandate 15 years in prison by treating such offenses \n",
      "as separate violent felonies.  \n",
      "B. Another situation that repeatedly arises under \n",
      "§ 924(e) is an offense co mmitted while the defendant \n",
      "evades or resists arrest for another offense.  \n",
      "Examples include pushing a police officer after \n",
      "committing a robbery, United States v. Schieman , \n",
      "894 F.2d 909 (7th Cir. 1990); fleeing a police officer \n",
      "after a traffic stop that interrupted a domestic \n",
      "assault, United States v. Davidson , 527 F.3d 703  \n",
      "(8th Cir. 2008), vacated in part on other grounds ,  \n",
      "551 F.3d 807 (8th Cir. 2008) (per curiam); and \n",

      "high-speed chase, Levering v. United States , 890 F.3d \n",
      "738 (8th Cir. 2018).  The decisions applying § 924(e) to these situations acknowledge confusion and \n",
      "judicial disagreement, with some courts ruling that any separation of time between the onset of two \n",
      "offenses supports a finding that they occurred on different occasions.  No such rule can be clearly \n",
      "derived from the present statute using ordinary rules \n",
      "of statutory construction.  The courts of appeals should instead have followed the tradition of lenity to \n",

Those rules are rarely satisfied . \\nThe same is true  here , not least because reading Spend-\\ning Clause legislation to create rights privately enforce-\\nable via Section 1983 can raise  similar concerns.   \\nStart with federalism considerations.  This Court has \\nrequired Congress to speak clearly when its legislation \\ndisrupts the usual federal -State balance of power.  See \\nGregory  v. Ashcroft , 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991).  In Spend-\\ning Clause programs like Medicaid, that balance is care-\\nfully tailored:  the federal government establishes con-\\nditions for funding, but within those parameters, States \\ngenerally have latitude to develop their own programs.  \\nSee Alexander  v. Choate , 469 U.S. 287, 303 (1985).  In-\\ndeed, Spendin g Clause legislation operates \"much in \\nthe nature of a contract.\"  Pennhurst , 451 U.S. at 17.  \\nThe \"legitimacy\" of the federal -State bargain \"rests on \\nwhether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts \\nthe terms of the \\'contract.\\' \\u200a\"  Ibid.   A State cannot know-\\ningly accept those terms if it \"is unaware of the condi-\\ntions or is unable to ascertain what is expected of it.\"  \\nIbid.   Congress is thus expected to \"speak with a clear \\nvoice\" before imposing a condition on federal funding.  \\nIbid.   The same degree of clarity is called for  when the \\nfunding condition  involves a grant of  individual rights \\n18 \\n that could expose States to private  enforcement suits \\nunder Section 1983.    \\nRequiring  an unambiguous conferral of individual \\nrights also alleviates potential \"separation -of-powers \\nconcerns.\"  Gonzaga , 536 U.S. at 286.  Congress, not the \\njudicial branch , has \"primacy\" over creating causes of \\nactio n, and courts transgress that line by finding judi-\\ncially enforceable rights where Congress leaves  some \\ndoubt that it intended to create them.  Talevski , 599 U.S.  \\nat 183.  The rigorous standard of \"unambiguous confer-\\nral\" also safeguards the Executive\\'s role as the primary \\nenforcer of state c ompliance with federal funding condi-\\ntions.  See ibid.   If Congress intends the Executive to \\nshare that enforcement with potentially millions of ben-\\neficiaries, Congress  can be expected to say so clearly.  \\n3. Earlier decisions of this Court appeared to  \"sug-\\ngest that something less than an unambiguously con-\\nferred right\"  could still render  Spending Clause provi-\\nsions enforceable  under Section 1983.  Gonzaga , 536 U.S.  \\nat 282.  In Wilder  v. Virginia Hospital Ass\\'n , 496 U.S. \\n498 (1990), the Court reasoned  that Spending Clause \\nlegislation could be  enforceable under Section 1983 as \\nlong as  the provision was \"intend[ed] to benefit the pu-\\ntative plaintiff \\u200a\" and the plaintiff \\u200a\\'s asserted interest in \\nthe statute was not \"too vague and amorphous\" for \\ncourts to enforce.   Id. at 509  (citations omitted) .  The \\nCourt\\'s analysis in  Blessing  v. Freestone , 520 U.S. 329 \\n(1997), also led so me courts to permit  private plaintiffs \\nto enforce federal statutes  under Section 1983  \"so long \\nas the plaintiff falls within the general zone of interest \\nthat the statute is intended to protect.\"  Gonzaga , 536 \\nU.S. at 283.  \\nBut in  Gonzaga , the Court \"repudiate[d] the ready \\nimplication of a § 1983  action that Wilder \" and other \\n19 \\n early cases exemplified.  Armstrong  v. Exceptional Child  \\nCenter, Inc. , 575 U.S. 320, 330 n. (2015).  Gonzaga  held  \\nthat nothing \"short of an unambiguously conferred \\nright \" could  \"support a cause of action brought under  \\n§ 1983 .\"  536 U.S. at 283.   Only when the statutory  \"text \\nand structure \" unambiguously contain  \"explicit rights -\\ncreating \" language and an \"individual\"  focus  can federal \\nstatutes conceivably create Section 1983 -enforceable \\nrights .  Id. at 284, 286.  Policy -focused language —like a \\nprovision that  \"[n]o funds shall be made available \" to \\n\"any educational agency or institution which has a pol-\\nicy or practice of permitting the release  of [students\\'] \\neducation records\" without parents\\' written consent —\\nfails that bar .  Id. at 279 (quoting 20 U.S.C.  1232g(b)(1) ). \\nEven after Gonzaga  was decided in 2002 , courts of \\nappeals continued to mix statutory analysis of a partic-\\nular provision with  a more freewheeling inquiry into \\nquestions like whether Congress \"intended that the \\nprovision in question benefit the plaintiff .\"  Planned \\nParenthood Arizona Inc.  v. Betlach , 727 F.3d 960, 966 \\n(9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Blessing , 520 U.S. at 341) , cert. \\ndenied, 571 U.S. 1198 (2014) .  This Court i n Talevski  put \\na stop to  that approach, instructing that Gonzaga  alone \\n\"sets the standard for determining when a Spending \\nClause statute confers individual rights.\"  599 U.S. at \\n193 (Barrett,  J., concurring).  Talevski emphasized how \\n\"stringent\" that standard is, and how infrequently it \\nwill be met.  Id. at 186 (majority opinion) .  Only in the \\n\"atypical case\" will Spending Clause legislation clear \\nthe \"significant hurdle\"  of an unambiguous conferral of \\nindividual rights.   Id. at 183 -184.  Thus , \"§ 1983 actions \\nare the exception —not the rule —for violations of \\nSpending Clause statutes.\"  Id. at 193 -194 (Barrett, J., \\nconcurring).    \\n20'}\n",
      "{'B. The any-qualified-provider provision does not unambiguously confer individual federal rights': '1. This Court\\'s cases illustrate the hallmarks of un-\\nusual, rights -conferring provisions versus features that \\ndo not suffice .   \\nOn one end of the spectrum, Talevski  exemplifies the \\n\"atypical case\" where Congress clearly and unambigu-\\nously created individual -focused rights enforceable un-\\nder Section 1983 .  599 U.S. at 183.  Again, Talevski  in-\\nvolved two provisions of a statute governing nursing \\nhomes that Congress appended to the federal Medicaid \\nstatute.  One required nursing homes to \"protect and pro-\\nmote\" residents\\' \"right to be free from\" certain \"physi-\\ncal or chemical restraints.\"  42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii).  \\nThe second provided that nursing homes \"must not \\ntransfer or discharge [a] resident\" unless certain pre-\\nconditions were satisfied.  42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(2)(A)  and \\n(B).  To parse those provisions, this Court began with \\ntheir \"place in the overall statutory scheme .\"  Talevski , \\n599 U.S. at 184.   Both provisions were housed in a sub-\\nsection of the statute tit led \"Requirements relating to \\nresidents\\' rights .\"  Id. at 184-185 (citation s omitted) .  Ze-\\nroing  in on the provisions\\' text, the Court observed that \\nthey made multiple  references to an individual benefi-\\nciary (the \"resident\"), and several express references  \\nto \"rights.\"  Ibid.  The Court held that the combined ef-\\nfect of the text and structure \"inexorably\" recognized \\nindividual rights enforceable under Section 1983 .  Id. at \\n192.  Even then, the Court considered whether other \\nstatutory features rebutted that unambiguous rights -\\ncreating language  by suggesting that Congress  had \\nruled  out Section 1983 remedies.  Id. at 186 -191.   \\nMany other types of provisions fall short .  Consider \\nthe provision in Gonzaga :  \"No funds shall be made \\n21 \\n available under any applicable program to any educa-\\ntional agency or institution which has a policy or prac-\\ntice of permitting the release of [students\\'] education \\nrecords       without the written consent of their par-\\nents.\"  20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1).  That nondisclosure provi-\\nsion include s no \"\\u200a\\'rights -creating \\' language ,\" \"speak[s] \\nonly to the Secretary of Education,\" and concerns only \\nwhether entities have a generalized policy that would \\ndisqualify them from funding .  Gonzaga , 536 U.S. at  \\n287-288 (citation omitted) .  Further, institutions needed \\nto comply only \"substantially\" to avoid termination of \\nfunding.  Id. at 288.  The absence of any mention of \\n\"rights,\" the provision\\'s focus on the Secretary rather \\nthan individuals, and its placement in a substantial -\\ncompliance  regime all foreclosed Section 1983 enforce-\\nment . \\nOr take the Medicaid provision in Armstrong , 42 \\nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(30)(A) , which require s state plans to \\n\"provide such methods and procedures \" as necessary to \\nassure that \"care and services are available under the \\nplan at least to the extent    available to the general \\npopulation in the geographic area.\"  In a footnote, Arm-\\nstrong  explained that the medical -provider plaintiffs  \\nhad not tried to bring a suit under Section 1983 , even \\nthough Wilder  had found a privately enforceable right \\nfor a nearby Medicaid provision  requiring state plans to \\nprovide \"for payment\" of certain services through \"rea-\\nsonable and adequate \" reimbursement rates.   575 U.S . \\nat 33 0 n.; 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(13)(A) (1982).4  The Court \\napproved of that strategic decision \"since our later opin-\\nions plainly repudiate the ready implication of a § 1983 \\naction that Wilder  exemplified.\"  575 U.S. at 33 0 n..   \\n \\n4  The provision in Wilder  has since been repealed.  See Balanced \\nBudget Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 105 -33, § 4711, 111 Stat. 507 -508. \\n22 \\n 2. Applying th ose precedents , the any -qualified -\\nprovider provision of the Medicaid statute , 42 U.S.C. \\n1396a(a)(23)(A)  cannot surmount  the \"demanding bar\"  \\nfor unmistakably clear , rights -conferring language.   \\nTalevski , 599 U.S. at 180.  The statutory \"text and struc-\\nture\" do not reveal the requisite  unambiguous conferral  \\nof individual rights .  Gonzaga , 536 U.S. at 286.   \\n a. The Court in Talevski  began by focusing on the \\nFNHRA provisions\\'  \"place in the overall statutory \\nscheme.\"  599 U.S. at 184 (citation omitted).  The Court \\nobserved that the provisions were set off from the rest \\nof the statute in a subsection expressly titled \"Require-\\nments relating to residents\\' rights .\"  Ibid.  (quoting 42 \\nU.S.C. 1396r(c)).  That  distinctive place in the statute  \\nwas, at the outset , \"indicative of an individual rights -\\ncreating focus.\"  Ibid.  (citation omitted).   \\nBeginning in the same place here, the any-qualified -\\nprovider provision lacks any special, distinctive place  \\nin Section 1396a(a).  The any -qualified -provider provi-\\nsion is housed in 42 U.S.C. 1396a, a section titled \"State \\nplans  for medical assistance.\"  Subsection (a) of that \\nstatute, titled \"Contents,\" includes 87 paragraphs of re-\\nquirements for state Medicaid plans, of which the any -\\nqualified -provider provision is number 23.  See 42 \\nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(1) -(87).  Those paragraphs ar e not ar-\\nranged in any discernible order, let alone  under  sub-\\nheadings that mention \"rights.\"  See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a).   \\nMany of the surrounding 86 paragraphs in 42 U.S.C. \\n1396a(a) lack even arguably rights -conferring  language .  \\nFor example, paragraph  (a)(58) requires state plans to \\nprovide for the development of a certain \"written de-\\nscription of the law of the State .\"  42 U.S.C. \\n1396 a(a)(58).  And paragraph (a)(6) requires state plans \\nto \"provide that the State [Medicaid] agency will make \\n23 \\n such reports, in such form and containing such infor-\\nmation, as the Secretary may from time to time re-\\nquire.\"  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(6).  That is simply a report-\\ning requirement —a generalized \" \\u200a\\'policy or practice\\' \\u200a\" of \\nthe sort this Court held does not confer individual \\nrights.  Gonzaga , 536 U.S. at 288 -289.  Section 1396a(a) \\nincludes many other similarly generalized policies.5  \\nSome  were added in the same amendments as the any -\\nqualified -provider provision.  See , e.g., Social Security \\nAmendments of 1967, Pub. L. No. 90 -248, § § 227-229, 81 \\nStat. 903 -905.  Paragraph  (a)(24), for example, requires \\nstate plans to \"provide for consultative services by \\nhealth agencies\" to \"hospitals, nursing homes,\" and \\nother institutions.  § 228(a)(3), 81 Stat. 904 (codified as \\namended at 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(24) ). \\nIt is not apparent  why Congress would have buried \\na rights -conferring provision deep within  a long list rid-\\ndled with  generalized policies.  If Congress intended to \\nsingle out the any -qualified -provider provision as the \\n\"atypical case,\" one would expect the statutory struc-\\nture to reflect that choice, as in Talevski . \\nb. Section 1396a(a)(23)\\'s place in the broader Medi-\\ncaid statute reinforces its lack of special, Section 1983 -\\nenforceable features .  This Court has already observed \\nthat provisions in a substantial -compliance regime for \\nStates are less likely to trigger Section 1983.  Gonzaga , \\n536 U.S. at 288.   A substantial -compliance regime tends \\nto indicate  a focus  on the \"aggregate practices \" of the \\n \\n5  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(1) ( State plan must \"provide that\" \\nit \"shall be in effect in all political subdivisions of the State\"); 42 \\nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(59) (State must \"maintain a list\" of \"all physicians \\nwho are certified to participate under the State plan\"); 42 U.S.C. \\n1396a(a)(7 1) (State  plan must  \"provide that the State will implement \\nan asset verification program \"). \\n24 \\n funding recipient , not \"whether the needs of any partic-\\nular person have been satisfied.\"  Does v. Gillespie , 867 \\nF.3d 1034, 104 2 (8th Cir. 2017)  (citation omitted); Gon-\\nzaga , 536 U.S. at 288 (citation omitted).   \\nThe Medicaid statute is a case in point:  a State need \\nonly \"comply substantially\" with Section 1396a(a)  re-\\nquirements  to continue receiving federal  funding.  42 \\nU.S.C. 1396c(2).   Congress has even authorized the Sec-\\nretary to waive entirely States \\' compliance with Section \\n1396a(a) requirements  under certain circumstances.   \\nE.g., 42 U.S.C. 1315(a)(1) (authorizing waivers for States  \\nto conduct pilot project s).  As in Gonzaga , the fact that \\nCongress tied federal funding to substantial compliance  \\nwith Section 1396a(a)(23) and its brethren —and permit-\\nted States  not to comply at all if the Secretary grants  \\na waiver —undercuts the inference that Section \\n1396a( a)(23) unambiguously secures individual rights.   \\nc. In Talevski , the Court then evaluated the text  \\nof the at -issue provisions alongside their place in the \\nstatutory scheme.  See 599 U.S. at 185.  There , the re-\\ncurrent references to \"rights\" in various levels of  \\nsubprovisions —and to \" residents \" in the specific provi-\\nsions —showed that Congress was unmistakably confer-\\nring Section 1983 -enforceable rights.  That same ap-\\nproach yields the opposite inference  here :  Section \\n1396a(a)(23)\\'s text, read in context, does not confer in-\\ndividual rights with the requisite clarity.  \\nFirst, Section 1396a(a)(23)  lacks \"explicit rights -\\ncreating\" language.  Gonzaga , 536 U.S. at 284.  Again, \\nthe nursing -home provisions in Talevski  were replete \\nwith references to \"rights\":  nursing homes were  \\nrequired  to protect \"the right  to be free from\" certain \\nrestraints, and the provisions were  nestled within sub-\\nheadings concerning \"requirements relating to \\n25 \\n residents\\' rights \" and \"transfer and discharge rights .\"  \\n599 U.S. at 184 -185 (brackets and citations omitted).  \\nBut Section 1396a(a)(23)\\'s any -qualified -provider provi-\\nsion never mentions \"rights,\" let alone repeatedly.  \\nWhile \"rights\" is not a magic word, the dearth of even \\nsynonyms for \"rights\" in Section 1396a(a)(23) makes it \\nharder to read the provision to unambiguously confer \\nthem .  \\nThe closest that Section 1396a(a)(23) comes is the \\nphrase \"may obtain \":  state plans must provide that an \\neligible individual \" may obtain \" care from \"any institu-\\ntion,\" \"qualified to perform the service\" required, \"who \\nundertakes to provide him such services .\"  42 U.S.C. \\n1396a(a)(23)(A)  (emphasis added); s ee Br. in Opp. 25.  In \\nisolation, that phrase could  be read as a freestanding \\nguarantee that beneficiaries \"may obtain\" medical care \\nfrom their choice of qualified provider .  But other parts \\nof the text undercut that reading . \\nSection 1396a(a)(23)  lacks an \"unmistakable focus on \\nthe benefited class.\"   Talevski , 599 U.S. at 186 (citation \\nomitted).   In Talevski , the nursing -home provisions at \\nissue, found in Section  1396r, were not directives to \\nStates about what to include in plans or instructions to \\nthe Secretary about preconditions State plans had to \\nmeet to obtain approval.  Those provisions instead de-\\nscribed \"rights\" for individual nursing -home patients \\nthrougho ut.  Here, however, while Section 1396a(a)(23) \\nmentions \"individua l[s]\" who benefit from the federal -\\nState bargain to furnish medical care, individual bene-\\nficiaries are not the focus in the same way.  Read as a \\nwhole, Section 1396a(a)(23) is directed to two other ac-\\ntors:  the States and the Secretary .   \\nAs to the States, all of Section 1396a(a) instructs \\nStates what the required \"Contents\" of their state plans \\n26 \\n must be.  Language in Section 1396a(a)(23)  shifts the \\nfocus to States further, granting them the authority to \\ndecline to provide payments to certain  providers \"con-\\nvicted of a felony\"  and to \"determine[]\"  which felony \\nconvictions  should qualify.  See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23) .   \\nMeanwhile, Section 1396a is ultimately directed to \\nthe Secretary  of HHS, since the provision\\'s reticulated \\nprescriptions for plans tell the Secretary what to look \\nfor before approving a State plan .  See 42 U.S.C. \\n1396a(b)) (\" The Secretary shall approve any plan which  \\nfulfills the conditions specified in subsection (a).\") ; see \\nGillespie , 867 F.3d at 1041 .  That feature of the statute \\nled a  plurality of this Court in Armstrong to conclude \\nthat a nearby  provision , 42 U.S.C. 1396a (a)(30)(A), \"is \\nphrased as a directive to the federal agency charged \\nwith approving state Medicaid plans, not as a conferral \\nof the right to sue upon the beneficiaries.\"  575 U.S.  \\nat 331  (plurality opinion) .  In sum, t he any -qualified -\\nprovider provision  \"serve[s] primarily to direct the Fed-\\neral Government\\'s distribution of public funds.\"  Talev-\\nski, 599 U.S. at 183 -184 (brackets and citation omitted).  \\nCongress could have taken another approach .  As \\nTalevski  illustrates, even within the Medicaid frame-\\nwork, Congress knows how to create individual rights .  \\nThe FNHRA is part of the Medicaid statute, and state \\nplans must provide for compliance with its provisions   \\nto be approved by the Secretary.  See 42 U.S.C. \\n1396a(a)(28)(A).   But Congress did not purport to confer \\nindividual rights through that state -plan requirement. \\nInstead, Congress created a separate, separately subti-\\ntled provision focused expressly on  rights , see Talevski , \\n599 U.S. at 18 4, and cross -referenced that section in the \\nstate -plan requirements for purposes of the Secretary\\'s \\nevaluation of plan compliance .  Had Congress wanted to \\n27 \\n create similarly enforceable individual rights to choose \\nany qualified provider, Congress could have taken the \\nsame tack .'}\n",
      "{'C. Finding a privately enforceable individual right in this case would create line-drawing problems': 'If Section 1396a(a)(23) creates privately enforceable \\nrights, many analogous provisions sprinkled through-\\nout the Medicaid statute and similar  federal benefits \\nprograms presumptively might as well .  Far from being \\n\"atypical\" exceptions, rights -creating provisions could \\nswallow the \"rule,\" contravening this Court\\'s admoni-\\ntions in Talevski , 599 U.S. at 183 ; id. at 193 (Barrett, J., \\nconcurring).  Other Spending Clause statutes likewise \\ninclude state -plan requirements that refer to \"individu-\\nals\" and their benefi ts.  But respondents offer no prin-\\ncipled way to draw lines between which of those provi-\\nsions confer individual rights and which do not.  That \\nrespondents\\' theory could potentially make many other \\nSpending Clause provisions privately enforceable is an \\nadditional reason to reject it, given Talevski \\'s directive \\nthat Section 1983 enforcement of Spending Clause leg-\\nislation is meant to be atypical . \\nScattered among the generalized state -plan policies \\nin Section 1396a are several other provisions that, like \\nSection 1396a(a)(23)\\'s any -qualified -provider provision, \\nrefer to \"individual\" beneficiaries .  For example,  para-\\ngraph (a)(12) requires Medicaid plans to \"provide that, \\nin determining whether an individual is blind, there \\nshall be an examination by a physician skilled in the dis-\\neases of the eye or by an optometrist, whichever the in-\\ndividual may select.\"  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a) (12).  Like  the \\nany-qualified -provider provision, paragraph (a)(12) ref-\\nerences an \"individual\" and suggests that the plan must \\nprovide that he \" may  select\" the eye specialist of his \\n28 \\n choice.  If the words \"individual\" and \"may\" suffice  to \\nunambiguously confer Section 1983 -enforceable  rights \\nin paragraph  (a)(23)\\'s any -qualified -provider provision , \\nthen presumably they would  unambiguously confer \\nrights in  paragraph  (a)(12), too. \\nOther provisions with similar phrasing  crop up \\namidst  Section 1396a (a)\\'s 87 paragraphs  in no discerni-\\nble order .  See pp. 22-23, supra .  Take paragraph (a)(3) , \\nwhich  requires state plans to \"provide for granting an \\nopportunity for a fair hearing before the State agency \\nto any individual whose claim for medical assistance un-\\nder the plan is denied or not acted upon with reasonable \\npromptness.\"  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(3).  Or paragraph  \\n(a)(26):  state plans must  provide , \"with respect to each \\npatient receiving\" certain services,  for \"a written plan \\nof care.\"  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)( 26).  Or consider  paragraph  \\n(a)(53):  state plans are to  provide \"for notifying in a \\ntimely manner all [eligible] individuals \" of \"the availa-\\nbility of benefits furnished by the special supplemental \\nnutrition program.\"   42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(53).    \\nOther examples include paragraph (a)(32), which re-\\nquires States to provide that \"no payment \" for care \\n\"provided to an individual shall be made to anyone other \\nthan such individual,\" or paragraph (a)(84), which re-\\nquires state plans  to provide that they will not termi-\\nnate coverage \"for an individual who is an eligible juve-\\nnile\" because he is \"an inmate of a public institution .\"  \\n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(32) ; 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(84) (2018 ); \\nsee Pet. Br. 37 -40.   \\nUnder respondents\\' theory, these provisions would \\nalso trigger Section 1983.  And the line -drawing difficul-\\nties these provisions present under that approach are \\nalready apparent.  Lower courts  have found some of \\nthose provisions to be rights -conferring, but others not \\n29 \\n to be .  See, e.g., Shakhnes  v. Berlin , 689 F.3d 244, 247 \\n(2d Cir. 2012)  (finding a privately enforceable right in \\nparagraph  (a)(3)) , cert. denied, 569 U.S. 918 (2013) ; \\nAliser  v. SEIU California , 419 F. Supp. 3d 1161, 1168 \\n(N.D. Cal. 2019) (holding that paragraph (a)(32) \"does \\nnot create an individually enforceable right\") .   \\nTreating Section 1396a(a)(23) as a Section 1983 - \\nenforceable provision would open the door for similar \\nprovisions —and the attendant line -drawing problems —\\nin other Spending Clause statutes.  The Food and Nu-\\ntrition  Act of 2008 , 7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq. , includes a long \\nlist of state -plan requirements  mention ing individual \\n\"households ,\" including  that the State shall \"promptly \\ndetermine the eligibility of each applicant household\"  \\nfor supplemental nutrition assistance benefits .  7 U.S.C. \\n2020(e)(3); see Briggs v. Bremby , 792 F.3d 239 (2d Cir. \\n2015) (finding Section 1983 -enforceable right ).  The fed-\\neral adoption -assistance statute requires state plans to , \\namong other things,  provide  for a \"fair hearing\" to \"any \\nindividual\" whose claim for benefits is denied or not \\nacted upon with \"reasonable promptness.\"   42 U.S.C. \\n671(a)(12); see ASW  v. Oregon , 424 F.3d 970 , 978 (9th \\nCir. 2005)  (finding Section 1983 -enforceable right ), cert. \\ndenied, 549 U.S. 812 (2006) .  And o ther b enefits statutes \\nrequire state plans  to provide that assistance \"shall be \\nfurnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible in-\\ndividuals .\"  E.g., 42 U.S.C. 302(a)(8), 1202(a)(11).  Those \\nprovisions also mention individual beneficiaries and \\nspecific benefits.  Respondents\\' theory offers no way to \\ndistinguish between these provisions.  And t hose broad \\nconsequences for  analogous provisions suggest that \\nSection 1396a(a)(23) cannot qualify as the \"atypical \\ncase\" of a privately enforceable Spending Clause provi-\\nsion.  See Talevski , 599 U.S. at 183.   \\n30'}\n",
      "{'D. Other enforcement mechanisms protect beneficiaries': 'Just because Section 1396a(a)(23) is not privately en-\\nforceable does not leave beneficiaries without protec-\\ntion.  Alternative enforcement mechanisms protect in-\\ndividual beneficiaries\\' interests, both with respect to \\nthe any -qualified -provider provision and other similarly \\nworded state -plan provisions.  If anything, those mech-\\nanisms cut further against the notion tha t Congress un-\\nmistakably designated Section 1396a(a)(23) as a trigger \\nfor Section 1983 suits.   The existence of an alternative \\n\"mechanism that Cong ress chose to provide for enforc-\\ning\" certain provisions \"buttress e[s]\" the \"conclusion \\nthat [those ] provisions fail to confer enforceable rights.\"  \\nGonzaga , 536 U.S. at 289.  \\nThe primary enforcement mechanism for Spending \\nClause legislation is the termination of federal funding.  \\nTalevski , 599 U.S. at 183; see 42 U.S.C. 1396c(2).  In ad-\\ndition, t he Secretary has rejected plan amendments \\nthat fail to satisfy the any -qualified -provider provision \\nand leave individual beneficiaries with insufficient \\nchoice among qualified providers.  See, e.g., Letter  from \\nThomas A. Scully, Admin. , Dep\\'t of Health & Human \\nServs., to Kathryn A. Plan t, Dir., N.J. Div. of Med. As-\\nsistance & Health Servs.  (Sept. 19, 2002) . \\nThe Secretary has also required States to give pro-\\nviders the right to an administrative appeal of their ex-\\nclusion from Medicaid.  See 42 C.F.R. 1002.213.  Re-\\nspondents contend that it would have been futile for \\nPlanned Parenthood to pursue  such  an appeal given \\nthat South Carolina terminated its enrollment pursuant \\nto state law.  Br. in Opp. 15 n.2.  But predicted outcomes \\nin individual cases do not make the procedure an  \\nineffective remedy across the board.  States terminate \\nproviders\\' participation in Medic aid for different  rea-\\n31 \\n sons, many of which are well suited to challenge in the \\nadministrative appeals process.  The existence of that \\nalternative mechanism for challenging the termination \\nof a particular provider thus \"buttresse [s]\" the conclu-\\nsion that Congress did not intend to create a privately \\nenforceable right for beneficiaries under Section 1983.  \\nGonzaga , 536 U.S. at 289.   \\nGiven the availability of alternative remedies, find-\\ning a Section 1983 -enforceable right in this case  \"would \\nresult in a curious system\"  of duplicative enforcement.   \\nGillespie , 867 F.3d at 1041 ; see Pet. Br. 42 -43.  Provid-\\ners would  be able to  challenge their disqualification  \\nin state administrative proceedings while individuals \\nwere challenging the same decision in federal court , po-\\ntentially rendering conflicting decisions.  See ibid.  \\nSubjecting States to competing litigation might also  \\n\"dissuade state officials from making decisions that \\nthey believe to be in the public interest \" when amending \\nor implem enting their Medicaid plans.  Gee v. Planned \\nParenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc. , 586 U.S. 1057, 105 8 \\n(2018) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) .   \\nFor other state -plan provisions that mention \"indi-\\nviduals,\" see pp. 27-29, supra , additional enforcement \\nmechanisms may be available.  For example, Section \\n1396a (a)(3)  requires state plans to provide for fair hear-\\nings  for individuals whose claims for  medical assistance  \\nare denied .  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(3) .  By federal regula-\\ntion, s tate fair-hearing system s must  \"meet the due pro-\\ncess standards set forth in Goldberg  v. Kelly , 397 U.S. \\n254 (1970 ),\" 42 C.F.R. 431.205 (d), and provide the op-\\nportunity for a hearing when an individual claims  that \\nthe State has erroneously terminated, suspended, or re-\\nduced his Medicaid benefits or eligibility , 42 C.F.R. \\n431.201, 431.220 .  And a s those federal regulations  \\n32 \\n reflect, the  Due Process Clause  independently requires \\nnotice and a fair hearing before States can deprive indi-\\nviduals of particular entitlements.   See Goldberg , 397 \\nU.S. 254.   Rejecting respondents\\' broad theory of pri-\\nvate enforcement here thus would not leave individual \\nbeneficiaries without a remedy .'}\n",
      "{'II. The court of appeals erred in finding an individual federal right': 'The Fourth Circuit\\'s decision allowing respondents\\' \\nSection 1983 action misapplied this Court\\'s cases and \\ncontravened this Court\\'s recent admonitions about the \\nrarity of rights -conferring provisions.  The court fo-\\ncused on isolated language in the any -quali fied-provider \\nprovision\\'s text but failed to properly  consider how Sec-\\ntion 1396a(a)(23) fits within Section 1396a(a) and the \\nMedicaid statute writ large . \\n 1. Courts \"must read the words Congress enacted \\n\\'in their context and with a view to their place in the \\noverall statutory scheme.\\' \\u200a\"  Turkiye Halk Bankasi A.S.  \\nv. United States , 598 U.S. 264, 275 (2023) ( citation omit-\\nted).  Thus, as noted,  Talevski first examined the \\nbroader statutory scheme governing nursing homes be-\\nfore discussing how the at -issue provisions fit within \\nthat scheme .  599 U.S. at 184 -185. \\nHere, however, the  court of appeals below focused  \\nnarrowly  on Section 1396a(a)(23)\\'s  references to \"any \\nindividual\" and that eligible individuals \"may obtain\" \\nmedical assistance from qualified providers.  Pet. App. \\n25a.  Even if that language , in isolation,  could be read to \\nconfer individual rights , additional statutory context \\ndispels any inference that Congress unambiguously \\nconferred privately enforceable individual rights.   The \\nany-qualified -provider provision is simply one of a long \\nlist of conditions that the Secretary must find to be \\n33 \\n satisfied before approving state Medicaid plans, and \\nthere are other ways of en suring that Medicaid recipi-\\nents have a choice of qualified providers .  See pp. 30-31, \\nsupra .   \\nBy ignoring the provision\\'s place in the broader statute, \\nthe court of appeals failed to follow Talevski \\'s mode of \\nanalysis and violated the basic rule that \"the words of a \\nstatute must be read in their context and with a view to \\ntheir place in the overall statutory scheme.\"  King  v. \\nBurwell , 576 U.S. 473, 492 (2015) (citation omitted) . \\n 2. The court of appeals  discounted broader evidence \\nthat Section 1396a(a)(23) does not confer privately en-\\nforceable rights based on an erroneous view  of this \\nCourt\\'s precedents and a 1994 statute.  See Pet. App. \\n27a-31a. \\nThe court of appeals downplayed  the any -qualified -\\nprovider provision\\'s place in the broader statute  be-\\ncause the Court in Wilder \"already held that a different \\nfunding condition enumerated in § 1396a(a) confers in-\\ndividual  rights enforceable via 42 U.S.C. §  1983 .\"  See \\nPet. App. 27a -28a.  As discussed, Wilder \\'s reasoning has \\nbeen repudiated.  See p . 21, supra .  Wilder  supplies a \\ncautionary tale, not interpretive instruction.  \\nThe court of appeals also invok ed a separate statu-\\ntory provision,  42 U.S.C. 1320a -2, which  provides, in rel-\\nevant part:  \\nIn an action brought to enforce a provision of [the \\nSocial Security Act], such provision is not to be \\ndeemed unenforceable because of its inclusion in a \\nsection of this chapter  requiring a  State  plan or spec-\\nifying the required contents of a  State  plan.  This \\nsection is not intended to limit or expand the grounds \\nfor determining the availability of private actions to \\nenforce  State  plan requirements other than by \\n34 \\n overturning any such grounds applied in Suter v. \\nArtist M., 112 S. Ct. 1360 (1992), but not applied in \\nprior Supreme Court decisions .  \\nIbid.   The court of appeals seemed to read Section \\n1320a -2 as a directive to consider whether a provision, \\nin isolation , \"speak[s] in clear and unambiguous terms,\" \\nPet. App. 29a, and to place no weight on wheth er the pro-\\nvision is a state -plan requirement.  That was error.  Sec-\\ntion 1320a -2 prohibits courts from deeming provisions \\nunenforceable under Section 1983 merely because of \\ntheir inclusion in a state plan .  See Midwest Foster Care \\n& Adoption Ass\\'n v. Kincade , 712  F.3d 1190, 1200 (8th \\nCir. 2013).   It does not require courts to ignore entirely \\nthe contextual significance of a provision\\' s placement in \\na list of state -plan requirements.  \\nFor similar reasons, the court of appeals was wrong \\nto dismiss the argument that \"the overlay of a substan-\\ntial compliance regime indicates\" that Section \\n1396a(a)(23) \"has an aggregate rather than individual \\nfocus .\"  Pet. App. 30a.  The court noted that Wilder  and \\nTalevski  both involved provisions within substantial -\\ncompliance regimes.  Ibid.   But again,  Wilder  supplies \\nno interpretive guidance.  And Talevski  did consider  \\nbroad  features of the Medicaid program , including that \\nthe typical remedy for noncompli ance with state -plan \\nrequirements is to cut off federal funds.  599 U.S . at 181-\\n182.  The Court simply found those features outweighed \\nby the FNHRA\\'s  recurrent, explicit textual and struc-\\ntural focus on individuals and their \"rights.\"  See id. at \\n183.  Talevski thus  shows that courts should consider \\nthe broader statutory context ; what courts cannot do is \\ntreat placement in a list of state -plan requirements as \\nthe beginning and end of the analysis.   \\n35 \\n 3. In an earlier decision, t he court of appeals also \\nmisread  this Court\\'s decision in O\\'Bannon  v. Town \\nCourt Nursing Center , 447 U.S. 773 (1980) .  See Pet. \\nApp. 62a -63a.6  The court of appeals stated that to the \\nextent O\\'Bannon  is relevant, it \"supports the existence \\nof a private right ,\" because of a statement in the deci-\\nsion that  Section 1396a(a)(23) gives Medicaid recipients \\n\"\\u200a\\'the right  to choose among a range of qualified provid-\\ners.\\'\\u200a\" Pet. App. 62a -63a (quoting O\\'Bannon , 447 U.S. at \\n787)  (emphases added and omitted).   \\nThe court of appeals read O\\'Bannon \\'s language  out \\nof context.   O\\'Bannon  was a due -process case, not a Sec-\\ntion 1983 right -of-action case.  The Court held that \\nPennsylvania did not violate the Due Process Clause by \\nterminating  a nursing home\\'s participation in  the state \\nMedicaid plan  without first holding a hearing , because \\nSection 1396a(a)(23)  does not create a cognizable prop-\\nerty  interest for Medicaid recipients \"to enter an un-\\nqualified home and demand a hearing to certify it.\"  \\nO\\'Bannon , 447 U.S.  at 785.   As an aside, O\\'Bannon  ob-\\nserved that Section 1396a(a)(23) purportedly did create \\n\"the right to choose among a range of qualified  provid-\\ners.\"  Ibid.  But t o the extent O\\'Bannon was recognizing \\nany \"right\" in that passage, it was a property interest \\nsounding in due process , not an unambiguous  conferral \\nof a Section 1983 -enforceable statutory right.    \\nMoreover, read in context, O\\'Bannon \\'s discussion of \\nrights actually  cuts against finding a privately enforce-\\nable right  here .  For purposes of due process , O\\'Bannon  \\nheld that Section 1396a(a)(23) \"clearly does not confer\" \\n \\n6 The court of appeals discussed O\\'Bannon  in its second decision, \\nwhich this Court subsequently vacated in light of Talevski .  See Pet. \\nApp. 62a -63a.  The court  of appeals then declined to revisit  its \"pre-\\nvious determinations\" on remand.  Id. at 12a.  \\n36 \\n the very right  that respondents assert here :  the right \\nto challenge  a State\\'s  termination of a particular pro-\\nvider as unqualified .  447 U.S. at 785 -786.  It would make \\nlittle sense to interpret the same provision as \"unam-\\nbiguously \" conferring an individual right to bring such \\na challenge via Section 1983 .'}\n"

      " Attempting to avoid this Court 's review, \n",
      "Respondents claim the opinion below is consistent \n",
      "with precedent and narrowly prohibits the State of \n",
      "Washington from \"destroying \" salmon fisheries and \n",
      "abrogating treaty rights. These claims cannot \n",
      "withstand scrutiny.  \n",
      " The Ninth Circuit opinion is not a narrow \n",
      "restriction on \"destroying \" salmon runs. If it were, \n",
      "Washington would not have sought certiorari. Salmon \n",
      "are vital to our Sta te's people, culture, and economy. \n",
      "In reality, the panel held that the Treaties make a \n",
      "promise beyond the State 's control: \"that the number \n",
      "of fish would always be sufficient to provide a \n",
      "'moderate living ' to the Tribes. \" Pet. App. 94a. This \n",

      "Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing \n",
      "Vessel Ass 'n, 443 U.S. 658 (1979)  (Fishing Vessel ). \n",
      " Respondents similarly err in claiming that \n",
      "Washington 's equitable defenses would abrogate \n",
      "treaty rights. As this Court recognized in City of \n",
      "Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation , 544 U.S. 197, 213 \n",
      "(2005) , equitable defenses address what relief is \n",
      "available, not what rights exist. And as this Court and \n",
      "the Second Circuit have recognized, such defenses are \n",
      "available in treaty cases. The Ninth Circuit disagreed, \n",
      "rejectin g these holdings and the powerful equities \n",
      "here, where the federal government designed and \n",
      "granted permits for the very culverts it now claims \n",
      "violate tr eaties it signed 160 years ago.  \n",
      " Finally, Respondents ' attempt to reconcile the \n",
      "injunction here with pr ecedent fails. Respondents \n",

      " To minimize the conflict with Fishing  Vessel  \n",
      "and the importance of this case, Respondents \n",
      "mischaracterize the Ninth Circuit 's opinion in two \n",
      "crucial respects.  \n",
      " First, Respondents claim that the Ninth \n",
      "Circuit 's opinion narrowly \"addressed whether the \n",

      "destroy the fisheries that form the Treaty res, and \n",
      "held that they do. \" Tribes BIO at 17; id. at 18; U.S. \n",
      "BIO at 14. If that were all that the panel held, this \n",
      "case would be as unimportant as Respondents claim. \n",
      "Indeed, the Ninth Circuit held 40 years ago that \n",
      "\"neither the treaty Indians nor the state on behalf of \n",
      "its citizens may permit the subject matter of these \n",
      "treaties to be destroyed. \" United States v. Wash ington, \n",

      "o.php?pk_vid=0000008307 . \n",
      " But that is not what the Ninth Circuit held. It \n",

      "3 \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "  There are crucial differences between what \n",
      "Respondents claim the Ninth Circuit held (a \n",

      "actually held (a guaranteed moderate living). Most \n",
      "importantly, as detailed below, an anti -destruction \n",
      "principle could be reconciled with Fishing  Vessel , \n",
      "while the modera te-living guarantee cannot. An anti -\n",
      "destruction rule would also lead to a very different \n",
      "test for treaty violation from the one the courts below \n",
      "applied. Rather than simply concluding that Tribes \n",
      "are not earning a moderate living from fishing and \n",
      "that culv erts play some unknown part in that, the \n",
      "courts below would have needed to consider whether \n",
      "the State destroyed the salmon fishery or particular \n",
      "salmon runs by building culverts, given factors like: \n",
      "(1) the State built culverts to standards that the \n",
      "federa l government said were sufficient to allow \n",
      "streams to pass through and comply with federal law; \n",
      "(2) Respondents ' highest estimate of salmon affected \n",
      "by state culverts (200,000) is a small fraction of \n",
      "annual harvests even in recent times (e.g., less than \n",
      "5% of the 4 million salmon harvested in 2003, ER 267), \n",
      "and an even smaller percentage of historic harvests; \n",
      "(3) state culverts are vastly outnumbered by non -\n",
      "State culverts, including federal culverts, Pet. App. \n",
      "203a, ER 196 -209, 407 -555; and (4) salmon runs had \n",
      "declined dramatically long before the State built any \n",

      "1922)  (\"It is a well -known fact that the salmon \n",
      "industry of the state is r apidly disappearing.\") . \n",
      " Respondents ' second mischaracterization is \n",

      "[{\"I. Respondents Mischaracterize the Ninth Circuit's Opinion\": 'To minimize the conflict with Fishing  Vessel  \\nand the importance of this case, Respondents \\nmischaracterize the Ninth Circuit \\'s opinion in two \\ncrucial respects.  \\n First, Respondents claim that the Ninth \\nCircuit \\'s opinion narrowly \"addressed whether the \\nTreaties place any limits on the State \\'s ability to \\ndestroy the fisheries that form the Treaty res, and \\nheld that they do. \" Tribes BIO at 17; id. at 18; U.S. \\nBIO at 14. If that were all that the panel held, this \\ncase would be as unimportant as Respondents claim. \\nIndeed, the Ninth Circuit held 40 years ago that \\n\"neither the treaty Indians nor the state on behalf of \\nits citizens may permit the subject matter of these \\ntreaties to be destroyed. \" United States v. Wash ington, \\n520 F.2d 676, 685 (9th Cir. 1975) . The State has made \\nclear that it has no objection to that rule. Ninth \\nCircuit Oral Argument at 50:20 to 51:10  (Oct. 16, \\n2015), http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/media/view_vide  \\no.php?pk_vid=0000008307 . \\n But that is not what the Ninth Circuit held. It \\nheld that the Treaties \"promise that the number of \\nfish would always be sufficient to provide a \\'moderate \\nliving \\' to the Tribes. \" Pet. App. 94a; U.S. BIO at 13 \\n(admitting that the panel held that Washington \\n\"violates the treaty fishing right by interfering with \\nthe Tribes \\' ability to ensure a moderate living \"). \\n3 \\n \\n \\n  There are crucial differences between what \\nRespondents claim the Ninth Circuit held (a \\nguarantee against fishery destruction) and what it \\nactually held (a guaranteed moderate living). Most \\nimportantly, as detailed below, an anti -destruction \\nprinciple could be reconciled with Fishing  Vessel , \\nwhile the modera te-living guarantee cannot. An anti -\\ndestruction rule would also lead to a very different \\ntest for treaty violation from the one the courts below \\napplied. Rather than simply concluding that Tribes \\nare not earning a moderate living from fishing and \\nthat culv erts play some unknown part in that, the \\ncourts below would have needed to consider whether \\nthe State destroyed the salmon fishery or particular \\nsalmon runs by building culverts, given factors like: \\n(1) the State built culverts to standards that the \\nfedera l government said were sufficient to allow \\nstreams to pass through and comply with federal law; \\n(2) Respondents \\' highest estimate of salmon affected \\nby state culverts (200,000) is a small fraction of \\nannual harvests even in recent times (e.g., less than \\n5% of the 4 million salmon harvested in 2003, ER 267), \\nand an even smaller percentage of historic harvests; \\n(3) state culverts are vastly outnumbered by non -\\nState culverts, including federal culverts, Pet. App. \\n203a, ER 196 -209, 407 -555; and (4) salmon runs had \\ndeclined dramatically long before the State built any \\nculverts, see, e.g. , Vail v. Seaborg , 207 P. 15, 16 (Wash. \\n1922)  (\"It is a well -known fact that the salmon \\nindustry of the state is r apidly disappearing.\") . \\n Respondents \\' second mischaracterization is \\nthat the Ninth Circuit \\'s opinion makes clear that it \\naddresses only culverts, so it will not have the far -\\nreaching impacts the State and amici describe. See, \\n4 \\n \\n \\n e.g., Tribes BIO at 36 ( \"[T]he  Court of Appeals could \\nnot have been clearer about the narrow scope of its \\ndecision[.] \"); U.S. BIO at 13 -14, 19 -20. But every \\npassage Respondents cite to support this proposition \\ncomes from the concurrence in denial of rehearing en \\nbanc authored by two pa nel members —not the \\nopinion. See, e.g. , Tribes BIO at 36 (citing Pet. App. \\n10a-11a); U.S. BIO at 13 -14 (citing Pet. App. 10a -11a); \\nU.S. BIO at 20 (citing Pet. App. 11a -12a). And when \\nRespondents or others file the next case based on the \\npanel \\'s opinion, th ey will surely argue that the \\nconcurrence in denial of rehearing \"is not a means by \\nwhich [the Ninth Circuit] can definitively speak on \\nlegal questions. \" Hughes v. Kisela , 862 F.3d 775, 797 \\n(9th Cir. 2016), as amended  (June 27, 2017)  (Ikuta, J., \\ndissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (citing \\nEEOC v. Bass Pro Outdoor World, LLC , 865 F.3d 216, \\n234 (5th Cir. 2017) (Jones, J., dissenting from denial  \\nof rehearing en banc) ( \"[T]he panel has only the right \\nto comment on the dissent from denial, not to \\narticulate any additional binding precedent. \"); Young \\nv.

The panel chose not to do that (despite \\nmaking other amendments on rehearing), instead \\n5 \\n \\n \\n issuing a concurrence in the denial of rehearing en \\nbanc. The Court should see through the panel \\'s (and \\nRespondents \\') efforts to downplay the opinion \\'s scope.  \\n Subsequent ev ents support the State \\'s concern \\nabout the opinion \\'s breadth and the need for this \\nCourt \\'s review. For example, the EPA \"cited the Ninth \\nCircuit culvert decision as a basis for disapproving \\nsome of Washington State \\'s water quality standards \\nunder the Clean  Water Act \" and Maine \\'s water quality \\nstandards.1 And the commission that  regulates land \\nuse in the Columbia River Gorge under 16 U.S.C.  \\n§§ 544 -544p , relied on the panel decision to uphold  the \\ndenial of a railroad \\'s land -use permit  in Oregon .2 \\n In short, Respondents \\' attempts to narrow the \\nopinion ring hollow, failing to undermine the \\nexceptional importance of this case.'}, {'II. The Conflict with Fishing Vessel Is Real': 'The Ninth Circuit ruled tha t the Treaties \\n\"promise that the number of fish would always  \\nbe sufficient to provide a \\'moderate living \\' to the \\nTribes. \" Pet. App. 94a.  This is irreconcilable with \\nFishing  Vessel , which specifically rejected the  \\nTribes \\' argument \"that the treaties had reserved a \\npre-existing right to as many fish as their commercial \\n                                            \\n1 Conference of Western Attorneys General, American \\nIndian Law Deskbook  § 9:18, 674 -76 & nn.28, 31 -32 (2017) . \\n2 Union Pac.

Ct . App. Nov. 7, 2017) . \\n6 \\n \\n \\n and subsistence n eeds dictated. \" Fishing Vessel , 443 \\nU.S. at 670.  \\n To avoid the conflict, Respondents first rewrite \\nFishing  Vessel . They claim the Court  recognized a \\n\"right \" to as many fish as the Tribes need for a \\nmoderate living, subject to a \"ceiling \" of 50% of the \\navailable  fish. U.S. BIO at 13 ; Tribes BIO at 19 -20. \\nThis reverses the opinion and conflates the right with \\nthe remedy . Fishing Vessel declared \"a right , secured \\nby treaty, to take a fair share of the available fish .\" \\nFishing Vessel , 443 U.S. at 684 -85 (emphasis added). \\nThe Court then turned to the remedy, affirming an \\nequitabl e apportionment of 50% of the catch to the \\nTribes unless \"tribal needs may be satisfied by a lesser \\namount. \" Id. at 685 -86. Thus, rather than declaring a \\nright to a \"moderate living, \" the Court declared a right \\nto a fair share, capped at 50%. If a lesser share were \\nsufficient to \"provide the Indians with a livelihood —\\nthat is to say, a moderate living ,\" their share could be \\nreduced. Id. at 686 -87. Thus, as the Tribes themselves \\nadmit, Fishing Vessel  used the moderate living \\n\"standard to bound the tribal share \" of the catch, not \\nto declare a minimum guarantee . Tribes BI O at 20.  \\nBy contrast , \"the panel opinion turns Fishing Vessel  \\non its head \" by \"impos[ing] an affirmative duty upon \\nthe State to provide a certain quantity of fish[.] \"  \\nPet. App. 24a.  \\n Next, Respondents claim that the panel needed \\nto read Fishing  Vessel  to guarantee a moderate living \\nbecause otherwise the State could \"entirely eliminate \\nthe supply of harvestable salmon. \" U.S. BIO at 14 \\n(quoting Fletcher, J., concurring in the denial of \\nrehearing en banc, Pet. App. 9a). Judge O \\'Scannlain \\nproperly described this theory as \"utter nonsense. \" \\n7 \\n \\n \\n Pet. App. 28a. Courts have equitable powers to protect \\nthe shared salmon fishery from waste, overfishing, or \\ndestruction. See Fishing Vessel , 443 U.S. at 692 n.32; \\nUnited States v. Wash ington , 52 0 F.2d at 685 \\n(\"[N]either the treaty Indians nor the state on behalf \\nof its citizens may permit the subject matter of these \\ntreaties to be destroyed. \"); United States v. Oregon , \\n657 F.2d 1009, 1015 -16 (9 th Cir. 1981) . Countless \\nother state and federal laws protect salmon, and the \\nState has strong incentives to preserve and restore \\nsalmon runs to benefit all Washingtonians, evidenced \\nby the State \\'s voluntary expenditure of hundreds of \\nmillions  of dollars on salmon recovery.  \\n The Tribes also claim there is no conflict \\nbecause Fishing Vessel  left \"open \" \"whether the \\nTreaties place any limits on the State \\'s ability to \\ndestroy the treaty fisheries. \" Tribes  BIO at 18 . It is \\ntrue that Fishing  Vessel  did not specifically address \\nthat question. But the Ninth Circuit \\'s holding is not \\nlimited to that question. The court held the Treaties  \\n\"promise that the number of fish would always be \\nsufficie nt to provide a \\'moderate living \\' to the Tribes. \" \\nPet. App. 94a.  That  rationale is irreconcilable with \\nFishing  Vessel , which rejected that very principle. Cf. \\nSeminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida , 517 U.S. 44, 67  \\n(1996)  (\"When an opinion issues for the Court, it is not \\nonly the result but also those portions of the opinion \\nnecessary to that result by which we are bound. \").'}, {\"III.

And Sherrill  and \\nsubsequent Second Circuit cases have applied \\nequitable defenses to bar analogous tr eaty claims.  \\n Next, Respondents claim Sherrill is \\ndistinguishable because it did not address \"specific \\nrights \" created by Treaties. U.S. BIO at 22. Not so. \\nThe tribe \\'s claim in that case was that it was exempt \\nfrom tax on property within its  \"reservation s et aside \\nby the 1794 Canandaigua Treaty .\" Sherrill , 544 U.S. \\nat 212; see also id.  at 203 -05. Although it was \\nundisputed that the land at issue was within the \\ntreaty reservation, the Court held that equitable \\nconsiderations barred the tribe \\'s claim. Id. at 213-20. \\n Respondents also point out that the federal \\ngovernment was not a party to Sherrill . Tribes BIO at \\n27; U.S. BIO at 22. But Respondents never explain \\nwhy this matters, especially given that the United \\nStates appeared as amicus in  Sherrill  to support the \\ntribe. Nor does this lessen the circuit conflict —the \\nUnited States was party to Second Circuit cases \\napplying equitable defenses. See Oneida Indian \\n9 \\n \\n \\n Nation v. Cty. of Oneida , 617 F.3d 114 (2d Cir. 2010), \\ncert. denied , 565 U.S. 970 ( 2011) ; Cayuga Indian \\nNation v. Pataki , 413 F.3d 266 (2d Cir. 2005), cert. \\ndenied , 547 U.S. 1128 (2006) . \\n Next, Respondents assert that this case differs \\nfactually from Sherrill and the Second Circuit cases, \\nwhich involved \"long-moribund sovereignty \" over land \\nheld by others. U.S. BIO at 22 -23; Tribes BIO at 27. \\nBut these arguments go to whether the State \\'s \\nequitable defenses should prevail on the merits, not \\nwhether the State can raise these defenses at all. \\nHere, the district court dismissed the State \\'s defenses \\nas a matter of law at the pleading stage, Pet. App. \\n273a -74a, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed that \\ndecision, creating a clear conflict.  \\n These factual distinctions are also weak. \\nSherrill  and the Second Circuit cases all involved  \\nclaims within a tribe \\'s historic reservation lands.  \\nSherrill , 544 U.S. at 212; Oneida  Indian Nation , 617 \\nF.3d at 119.  By contrast, Respondents here seek to \\nregulate State actions outside of reservations in  \\nareas wher e the Tribes \"cede[d], relinquish[ed], and \\nconvey[ed] . . . all their right, title, and interest in and \\nto the lands. \" Treaty with the Nisqualli, Puyallup Etc. \\n1854 (Medicine Creek Treaty), arts. I, III, 10 Stat. \\n1132, 1133 (Dec. 26, 1854, ratified Mar. 3, 1855, \\nproclaimed Apr. 10, 1855) . If anything, such claims \\nthreaten to be more disruptive than claims to \\nreservation lands. And if equity can limit a treaty \\nclaim to reservation l and itself, surely it can limit \\nother typ es of claims.  \\n Finally, Respondents claim that  this case \\ndiffers bec ause the T reaties here have been the \\n10 \\n \\n \\n subject of litigation for over a century. But the same \\nwas true in Sherrill , where litigation seeking \\ncompensa tion for the t ribe\\'s lost land began in 1893.  \\nSherrill , 544 U.S. at 207. And the history of litigation \\nover these Treaties actually supports the availability \\nof equitable defenses here. At least since United \\nStates v. Winans , 198 U.S. 3 71 (1905) , and throughout \\nsubsequent decades, the federal government has \\nbrought many cases to enforce the Stevens Treaties. \\nYet at the exact same time , the federal government \\nwas enco uraging and funding Washington \\'s highway \\nconstruction and directing the State \\'s culvert design.3 \\nEven after this case was filed in 1970, the federal \\ngovernment continued to issue permits for culverts in \\nWashington, saying that they complied with federal \\nlaw. ER 990.  Given that the federal government  \\nspent decades suing to enforce the Treaties while \\nsimultaneously providing the design and permits for \\nthe State \\'s culverts, the State \\'s reliance interests are \\nclear. Cf. Sherrill , 544 U.S. at  217 ( \"It is well \\nestablished that laches, a doctrine focused on one \\nside\\'s inaction and the other \\'s legitimate reliance, may \\nbar long -dormant claims for equitable relief. \").'}, {\"IV. The Injunction is Irreconcilable with This Court's Precedent\": 'The United States c laims that normal \\nprinciples of injunctive relief —that injunctions be \\nnarrowly tailored to redress only conduct that violates \\n                                            \\n3 The federal government was also building dams in \\nareas covered by the Treaties that completely or partially blocked \\nsalmon runs. See, e.g. , Wild Fish Conservancy  v. Salazar , 628 \\nF.3d 513, 516 -17 (9 th Cir. 2010) ; Idaho ex rel. Evans v. Oregon , \\n462 U.S. 1017, 1020 -21 & nn. 2-5 (1983) . \\n11 \\n \\n \\n federal law, issued only after considering public \\nimpacts, and shaped with due regard for federalism —\\ndo not apply to treaty claims , and that the only \\nrelevant precedent is Fishing  Vessel . U.S. BIO at  \\n25-26. But Fishing  Vessel  announced no different \\nstandard and upheld an injunction carefully designed \\nto implement the treaty right to a fair share  of \\navailable fish. United States v. Washington , 384  \\nF. Supp. 312, 413 (W.D. Wash. 1974) ; see Fishing  \\nVessel , 443 U.S. at 685 -89. By con trast, the injunction \\nhere is not narrowly tailored to prevent \"destruction \" \\nof salmon or even to implement the \"moderate living \" \\nright declared by the Ninth Circuit. Pet. App. 94a. As \\nJudge O \\'Scannlain noted, the injunction forces the \\nState to replace hun dreds of culverts \"without regard \\nto whether replacement of a particular culvert \\nactually will increase the available salmon habitat. \" \\nPet. App. 37a.  \\n Neither Respondent disputes this. The United \\nStates excuses this overbroad injunction by claiming \\nthat the district court followed the State \\'s own \\nprioritization methodology. U.S. BIO at 24. Not so. \\nThe district court criticized and rejected the State \\'s \\nprioritization, Pet. App. 169a -70a, and substituted its \\nown, Pet. App. 237a. It gave equal priority to al l \\nculverts that have \"200 lineal meters or more of \\nsalmon habitat upstream to the first natural passage \\nbarrier, \" Pet. App. 237a, regardless of whether other \\nbarriers prevent salmon from getting to the culvert, \\nand regardless of cost , Pet. App. 247a.  \\n Fina lly, Respondents claim the State has \\ninflated the injunction \\'s costs. U.S. BIO at 25; Tribes \\nBIO at 33. The State has been living under the \\ninjunction for four years, and during that time, \\n12 \\n \\n \\n removing and replacing highway culverts to the \\nstandard the distric t court ordered has averaged \\nseveral million dollars per culvert.4 Even if just a \\nfraction of the hundreds of culverts the injunction \\norders replaced have no impact, tens of millions of \\nstate dollars will be wasted.'}]\n"

The ability of EPA to issue sporadic, unforeseeable, and largely unreviewable exemptions to small refineries imposes significant economic damage on biofuels producers': '.  \\nPetitioners portray the small refinery \\nexemption provisions of the RFS program as a flexible \\ntool created by Congress to guarantee small refineries \\nperpetual financial success. Regardless of the underlying cause of a small refinery\\'s financial trouble – from a global COVID-19 pandemic to its \\ninability to adapt to the slow and foreseeable \\nincreases in biofuel blending requirements of the RFS program – Petitioners believe the solution is for EPA to issue small refineries extensions of their \\nexemptions from RFS obligations \"at any time\" \\nregardless of how long it has been since the small \\nrefinery last held an exemption. Curtailing EPA\\'s \\nsupposed authority to issue dozens of exemptions, Petitioners argue, will produce a wave of small \\nrefinery failures. Pet\\'rs\\' Br. 4, 17. This argument \\nignores the original purpose of the RFS program, its structure, the recent history of small refinery viability, and the countervailing harm that a RFS program administered in that manner causes to \\nbiofuels producers across the country.  \\n14 \\n \\n  Congress did not grant EPA unilateral \\nauthority to put its thumb on the scale in order to influence the price of bi ofuels. The briefs of \\nRespondents and Federal Respondent explain that \\nthe small refinery exemption aspect of the RFS \\nprogram was designed by Co ngress to serve as a \\nbridge that would allow initially disadvantaged small \\nrefineries to eventually attain the ability to ensure \\nperpetual compliance with the RFS biofuel blending \\nmandates.

Respondents and Federal Respondent further explain that the plain and most logical reading of the \\nrelevant statutory text at 42 U.S.C. §7545(o)(9) uses \\nthe term \"extension\" in its temporal sense and \\nincludes a continuity element. Resp\\'ts\\' Br. 19-33 and \\nFed. Resp\\'t\\'s Br. 17-23. \\nPetitioners\\' claim that small refineries are on \\nthe cusp of closure if the av ailability of small refinery \\nexemptions is curtailed is not supported by the evidence.  For compliance years 2013 to 2015, a mere eight, seven, and seven small refinery exemptions \\nwere granted, respectively.\\n20 Nevertheless, \\nPetitioners do not provide evidence that any of the remaining 50+ refineries that did not receive \\nexemptions during that time  were forced to close.   \\nThe reason for the refineries\\' continued success \\nwithout the crutch of a small refinery exemption is \\ntheir ability to purchase RIN s from the open market \\nto compensate for their inability to blend biofuels at a reasonable price. The refineries are able to large pass the costs of those RINs to consumers. While EPA\\'s \\nadministration of the RFS program and its \\n                                                 \\n20 EPA Small Refinery Exemption Dashboard, supra  note 10. \\n15 \\n \\n interpretation of relevant provisions has been \\ninconsistent over the years, EPA has consistently maintained that the cost to purchase RINs on the \\nopen market can largely be passed to consumers.  \\nWhile the CAA is sprinkled with several \\nmandates that provide regulated parties the ability to apply for general hardship exemptions or temporary \\nexemptions based on unforeseen circumstances, EPA \\nexplained in its promulgation of its initial RFS program regulations that the ability of obligated parties to purchase RINs from the nationwide trading program rendered such exemptions unnecessary \\nunder the RFS program. \\nIn recent rulemakings, we have included \\na general hardship exemption for parties that are able to demonstrate severe economic hardship in complying with \\nthe standard. We proposed not to include \\nprovisions for a general hardship exemption in the RFS program. Unlike most other fuels programs, the RFS \\nprogram includes inherent flexibility \\nsince compliance with the renewable \\nfuels standard is based on a nationwide \\ntrading program, without any per gallon requirements, and without any \\nrequirement that the refiner or importer \\nproduce the renewable fuel. By purchasing RINs, obli gated parties will \\nbe able to fulfill their renewable fuel obligation without having to make \\ncapital investments that may otherwise \\nbe necessary in order to blend renewable \\nfuels into gasoline. We believe that \\n16 \\n \\n sufficient RINs will be available and at \\nreasonable prices, given that EIA projects that far gr eater renewable fuels \\nwill be used than required. Given the \\nflexibility provided in the RIN trading \\nprogram, including the provisions for deficit carry-over, and the fact that the \\nstandard is proportional to the volume of \\ngasoline actually produced or imported, we continue to believe a general hardship exemption is not warranted. As a result, the final rule does not contain \\nprovisions for a general hardship \\nexemption.\\n21  \\nA decade later and under a different \\nPresidential Administration, EPA\\'s conclusion on that critical aspect of the RFS program had not changed. \\n\"All obligated parties, including merchant refiners, \\nare generally able to recover the cost of the RINs they need for compliance with the RFS obligations through the cost of the gasoline and diesel fuel they produce.\"\\n22  \\nEven if Petitioners could supply evidence of \\nscattered small refinery closures during the years in \\nwhich few exemptions were granted, that outcome \\ndoes not run contrary to th e larger purpose of the RFS \\nprogram when you consider that during that same \\ntime a plethora of new dome stic biofuels production \\nfacilities were constructed. For example, as of October \\n                                                 \\n21 U.S. EPA, Regulation of Fuels and Fuel Additives: Renewable \\nFuel Standard Program; Final Rule , 72 Fed.

      "{\"II. Affirming the Tenth Circuit's opinion will rightfully undercut EPA's ability to arbitrarily award secret financial windfalls to small refineries that escape judicial review and disrupt biofuels markets\": '. \\nThe briefs of Respondents and Federal \\nRespondent present compelling explanations as to why the only logical and practical reading of RFS \\nsmall refinery extension language is for the word \\n\"extension\" in 42 U.S.C. § 7545(o)(9)(B)(i) to have a temporal meaning and to include an inherent continuity requirement.

EPA , No. 18-1115, 2019 WL 2615358 at 38 \\n(D.C. Cir. June 25, 2019). Petitioner HollyFrontier \\nRefining and Marketing LLC now argues that \"extension\" means \"to grant.\" Pet\\'rs\\' Br. 18-19. \\nThis Court\\'s decision should be driven by the \\nclear intent of Congress, through the express language used in 42 U.S.C. §7545(o)(9), to limit small refineries relief from complying with the RFS obligations to extensions of their earlier temporary \\nexemptions. The Court should take comfort, however, \\nthat such a ruling will have the additional benefit of \\nlargely ending EPA\\'s practice of awarding large \\neconomic windfalls to unidentified small refineries, in unknown amounts, for unknown reasons, through the \\nissuance of confidential de cision documents that are \\nlargely immune from judicial review yet send economic ripple effects through the RINs market to the detriment of biofuels prod ucers and  refineries not \\nreceiving such largess. \\nAs explained above, EPA\\'s small refinery \\nexemption decisions are shrouded by secrecy. While \\nEPA now publishes on an online dashboard basic data about the number of petitions for extensions of small \\nrefinery exemptions that it has received, granted, or \\ndenied as well as the es timated number of gallons of \\nrenewable fuel and RINs exempted from the RFS program, the agency still refuses to publish the identifies of the refineries that have applied for or \\nreceived extensions of exem ptions or the rationales \\nfor those decisions. Incredibly, only EPA, the \\ncompanies and ABFA\\'s counsel knows who received \\n20 \\n \\n exemptions for compliance years 2016 and 2017 and \\nwhy, which is subject to a protective order.    \\nThe dubious legal rationale underpinning this \\nveil of secrecy is that all sma ll refineries that petition \\nfor extensions of exemptions claim that the information in the petitions is confidential business information (\"CBI\"). EPA then unquestioningly treats \\nas CBI all information in its final decision document, \\neven down to the name of the company seeking the exemption. EPA claims that regulations at 40 C.F.R. §§ 2.204, 2.205, and 2.208 require it to treat as CBI any information that small refineries claim is \\nconfidential until EPA can evaluate that claim. In \\nreality, however, EPA makes no effort to review the \\nsmall refineries\\' over-inclusive claims of CBI and \\nnever releases additional information about the recipients of the exemptions.  \\nEPA and the refineries had every reason to \\nproceed in secrecy.  This practice allows EPA to issue small refinery exemptions free from oversight or scrutiny from the public, Congress, or courts. EPA has \\nrefused, based on claims of CBI, to provide detailed \\ninformation about its small refinery exemption \\ndecisions in response to requests from Congress.\\n26 \\nEPA maintains this policy even after a refinery publicly discloses its receipt of a small refinery \\nexemption in public filings to the U.S. Securities and \\nExchange Commission. Even in the face of protracted Freedom of Information Act li tigation, EPA refused to \\nidentify the name or location of small refineries receiving exemptions, thereby shielding those \\ndecisions from judicial review. \\nSee Renewable Fuels \\n                                                 \\n26 See Grassley letter, supra  note 7.  \\n21 \\n \\n Ass\\'n v. EPA , No. 18-2031, 2021 WL 602913 at 1 \\n(D.C. Cir. Feb. 16, 2021). \\nThese exemptions are lucrative for the small \\nrefineries that receive them. While privately-owned \\nrefineries hold their exemption status close to the chest, public companies that must update shareholders with the ne ws have trumpeted their \\nwindfalls in financial disclosures.\\n27 It is worth noting \\nhere that the case at hand filed by Respondents was only made possible thanks to public disclosures made \\nby the companies themselves. Privately held small refineries that may have received exemptions based \\non identical agency rational es cannot, as a practical \\nmatter, be subject to any legal challenges because \\ntheir identifies remain unknown. Before EPA began \\npublishing its online Small Refinery Exemption Dashboard, this secrecy would have also allowed the \\nsmall refineries that received exemptions to dump \\ntheir now unnecessary RINs into the marketplace, \\nwhere they were privy to information that other market participants were no t.  The biofuel producers, \\non the other hand, were unaware that EPA was \\nundermining its own renewable volume obligation (\"RVO\") through dozens of small refinery exemptions \\nand continued to produce biofuels to meet an \\n                                                 \\n27 Jarrett Renshaw, U.S. Refiners Reap Big Rewards from EPA \\nBiofuel Waivers , Reuters (May 8, 2018), \\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-usabiofuels-  \\nsavings/u-s-refiners-reap-big-rewards-from-epa-biofuel-\\nwaiversidUSKBN1I91ZG  \\n(documenting claims of cost savings of $100 million by \\nAndeavor, $120 million by CVR Refining, and $79 million by \\nDelek U.S. Holdings). \\n22 \\n \\n anticipated market dema nd for RINs that never \\nmaterialized.  \\nWith its final decision documents shielded from \\nthe public scrutiny and facing an unprecedented \\nvolume of petitions, the level of detail and legal analysis that EPA began to provide in its final \\ndecision documents became shockingly sparse. As \\nABFA explained in the undisputed allegations in its \\nlitigation against EPA in the D.C. Circuit, where previous decision documents had contained 20 pages of refinery-specific an alysis, EPA\\'s decision \\ndocuments for compliance years 2016 and 2017 were \\ntypically only five pages of legal boilerplate following \\nby a few paragraphs, or in some cases a few sentences, \\nof refinery specific information.\\n28 Apparently even \\nthis minimal amount of work proved too much for EPA, such that for compliance year 2018 the agency \\nissued final determinations on 42 petitions through a \\ntwo-page letter that is currently subject to a separate legal challenge in the D.C. Circuit.\\n29 \\nABFA\\'s 2018 litigation against EPA was not \\nsuccessful due to the fact that EPA had not yet \\nreduced its change in me thodology for compliance \\nyears 2016 and 2017 to a written memo or guidance \\ndocument.  Hence, the D.C. Circuit found that EPA\\'s \\n                                                 \\n28 Brief of Petitioner at 39-40, Advanced Biofuels Ass\\'n v.
