      "The only question here is how to apply those long-set-\n",

      "case, involving a waiver of preemption under Section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act. \n",
      "As petitioners describe things, that question is \n",
      "“straightforward” because standing is automatic here.  Pet. Br. 35.  Petitioners profit  from sales of fuel.  They \n",
      "note that the waiver allowed California to impose state standards limiting greenhouse-gas emissions across automakers’ fleets an d requiring automakers to \n",
      "sell a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles.  Pe-titioners assert that “[ t]hey promptly challenged \n",

      "for Hippocratic Med. , 602 U.S. 367, 384 (2024), and pe-\n",
      "titioners elide the most salient  facts in this case.  EPA \n",
      "granted the relevant waiver  in 2013.  Petitioners did \n",
      "not challenge that waiver and neither did anyone else.  \n",
      "It remained in effect for more than six years before \n",

      " EPA withdrew it in 2019.  Du ring those six years, in \n",
      "response to the state standards and wider national \n",

      "changing their fleets and building consumer demand for electric vehicles.  Consumer preferences and the \n",

      "drew the waiver, automakers  accelerated their transi-\n",
      "tion to electric vehicles and consumer demand \n",
      "continued to grow. \n",
      "In 2021, when EPA invited comment on whether to \n",
      "reinstate the waiver, the state respondents supported reinstatement.  As their comment explained, the with-\n",
      "drawal had exceeded EPA’s authority and it deprived California’s regulations of legal effect.  But by the time \n",
      "EPA reinstated the waiver and petitioners challenged \n",
      "that decision in 2022, “‘both internal sustainability goals and external market forces’” were pushing \n",
      "“manufacturers to transition toward electric vehicles, \n",
      "irrespective of California’s regulations.”  Pet. App. 24a n.8.  Indeed, publicly available evidence submitted by \n",
      "the state respondents showed that zero-emission vehi-\n",

      "the relevant standards required.  Consumers were \n",
      "willing to pay substantial price premiums for those ve-\n",
      "hicles.  And automakers had strong incentives to keep selling them. \n",

      "properly held that petitioners failed to meet their bur-den of demonstrating redressability. \n",
      "Petitioners ask this Court to excuse that failure.  \n",
      "They first urge the Court to  adopt a new “categorical \n",
      "rule.”  Pet. Br. 4.  Unde r that rule, redressability \n",
      "would be established automatically whenever peti-\n",
