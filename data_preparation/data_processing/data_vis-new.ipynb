The any-qualified-provider provision does not create individual rights enforceable under 42 U.S.C.  1983': 'Private individuals seeking to enforce Spending \\nClause legislation through an action under 42 U.S.C. \\n1983 face a demanding bar:  Congress must have unam-\\nbiguously conferred individual federal rights in the stat-\\nute.  Gonzaga Univ.  v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 280 (2002).  That  \\n\"stringent standard\" will be satisfied only in the \"atyp-\\nical case.\"  Health & Hosp . Corp. of Marion County v. \\nTalevski , 599 U.S. 166, 183, 186 (2023).  This case is not \\natypical.  The Medicaid statute\\'s any -qualified -provider \\nprovision, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23)(A),  is buried in a long, \\nundifferentiated list of requirements for state Medicaid \\nplans , and its text lacks \"explicit rights -creating\" lan-\\nguage .  Gonzaga , 536 U.S. at 284. \\n16'}\n",
      "{'A. Spending Clause statutes must unambiguously confer individual rights to be privately enforceable under Section 1983': '1. Sect ion 1983  creates a private cause of action \\nagainst any person who, under color of state law, de-\\nprives another \"of any rights , privileges, or immunities \\nsecured by the Constitution and laws.\"  42 U.S.C. 1983 .  \\nSection 1983 thus authorizes suits against state actors \\nwho violate \"rights\" created by federal laws .  See Maine  \\nv. Thibo utot, 448 U.S. 1, 4 (1980).  Not every violation of \\na federal statute constitutes a deprivation of  \"rights\" \\nunder  Section 1983.   See Gonzaga , 536 U.S. at 283.  In-\\nstead, private plaintiffs cannot enforce a federal statute \\nunder Section 1983 unless  the statute unmistakably  \\n\"confer [s] individual rights upon a class of beneficiar-\\nies.\"  Id. at 285.   Even then,  Section 1983 enforcement \\nmay be unavailable, if Congress signaled expressly or \\nimplicitly that it displace d the Section 1983 remedy with \\nothers .  See City of Rancho Palos Verdes  v. Abrams , \\n544 U.S. 113, 120 ( 2005).  \\nLegislation  enacted  under the  Spending Clause, U.S. \\nConst. Art. I, § 8, Cl. 1 , is particularly u nlikely to confer  \\nenforceable individual rights .  The \"typical remedy for \\nstate noncompliance with\" conditions imposed in Spend-\\ning Clause legislation \"is not a private cause of action \\nfor noncompliance but rather action by the Federal Gov-\\nernment to terminate funds to the State.\"  Pennhurst \\nState Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman , 451 U .S. 1, 28 (1981).   \\nUnless Congress \" \\u200a\\'speak [s] with a clear voice \\'\\u200a\" and \\n\"manifests  an \\'unambiguous \\' intent to confer individual \\nrights,\" a Spending Clause statute is not  privately en-\\nforceable under Section 1983.  Gonzaga , 536 U.S. at 280 \\n(quoting Pennhurst , 451 U.S. at 17, 28, & n.21) ( empha-\\nsis added ). \\n17 \\n 2. That rigorous standard harks to similar ly strin-\\ngent rules in related contexts.  Courts do not  interpret \\nstatutes to abrogate States\\' sovereign immunity unless \\nCongress makes \"its intention unmistakably clear in the \\nlanguage of the statute.\"  Dellmuth  v. Muth , 491 U.S. \\n223, 228 (1989) (citation omitted) .  And only \"explicit \\n\\'right - or duty -creating language \\'\\u200a\" suffices to show that \\nCongress created a private right of action.  Gonzaga , \\n536 U.S. at 284 n.3 (citing Alexander  v. Sandoval , 532 \\nU.S. 275, 288 (2001)).  Those rules are rarely satisfied . \\nThe same is true  here , not least because reading Spend-\\ning Clause legislation to create rights privately enforce-\\nable via Section 1983 can raise  similar concerns.   \\nStart with federalism considerations.  This Court has \\nrequired Congress to speak clearly when its legislation \\ndisrupts the usual federal -State balance of power.  See \\nGregory  v. Ashcroft , 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991).  In Spend-\\ning Clause programs like Medicaid, that balance is care-\\nfully tailored:  the federal government establishes con-\\nditions for funding, but within those parameters, States \\ngenerally have latitude to develop their own programs.  \\nSee Alexander  v. Choate , 469 U.S. 287, 303 (1985).  In-\\ndeed, Spendin g Clause legislation operates \"much in \\nthe nature of a contract.\"  Pennhurst , 451 U.S. at 17.  \\nThe \"legitimacy\" of the federal -State bargain \"rests on \\nwhether the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts \\nthe terms of the \\'contract.\\' \\u200a\"  Ibid.   A State cannot know-\\ningly accept those terms if it \"is unaware of the condi-\\ntions or is unable to ascertain what is expected of it.\"  \\nIbid.   Congress is thus expected to \"speak with a clear \\nvoice\" before imposing a condition on federal funding.  \\nIbid.   The same degree of clarity is called for  when the \\nfunding condition  involves a grant of  individual rights \\n18 \\n that could expose States to private  enforcement suits \\nunder Section 1983.    \\nRequiring  an unambiguous conferral of individual \\nrights also alleviates potential \"separation -of-powers \\nconcerns.\"  Gonzaga , 536 U.S. at 286.  Congress, not the \\njudicial branch , has \"primacy\" over creating causes of \\nactio n, and courts transgress that line by finding judi-\\ncially enforceable rights where Congress leaves  some \\ndoubt that it intended to create them.  Talevski , 599 U.S.  \\nat 183.  The rigorous standard of \"unambiguous confer-\\nral\" also safeguards the Executive\\'s role as the primary \\nenforcer of state c ompliance with federal funding condi-\\ntions.  See ibid.   If Congress intends the Executive to \\nshare that enforcement with potentially millions of ben-\\neficiaries, Congress  can be expected to say so clearly.  \\n3. Earlier decisions of this Court appeared to  \"sug-\\ngest that something less than an unambiguously con-\\nferred right\"  could still render  Spending Clause provi-\\nsions enforceable  under Section 1983.  Gonzaga , 536 U.S.  \\nat 282.  In Wilder  v. Virginia Hospital Ass\\'n , 496 U.S. \\n498 (1990), the Court reasoned  that Spending Clause \\nlegislation could be  enforceable under Section 1983 as \\nlong as  the provision was \"intend[ed] to benefit the pu-\\ntative plaintiff \\u200a\" and the plaintiff \\u200a\\'s asserted interest in \\nthe statute was not \"too vague and amorphous\" for \\ncourts to enforce.   Id. at 509  (citations omitted) .  The \\nCourt\\'s analysis in  Blessing  v. Freestone , 520 U.S. 329 \\n(1997), also led so me courts to permit  private plaintiffs \\nto enforce federal statutes  under Section 1983  \"so long \\nas the plaintiff falls within the general zone of interest \\nthat the statute is intended to protect.\"  Gonzaga , 536 \\nU.S. at 283.  \\nBut in  Gonzaga , the Court \"repudiate[d] the ready \\nimplication of a § 1983  action that Wilder \" and other \\n19 \\n early cases exemplified.  Armstrong  v. Exceptional Child  \\nCenter, Inc. , 575 U.S. 320, 330 n. (2015).  Gonzaga  held  \\nthat nothing \"short of an unambiguously conferred \\nright \" could  \"support a cause of action brought under  \\n§ 1983 .\"  536 U.S. at 283.   Only when the statutory  \"text \\nand structure \" unambiguously contain  \"explicit rights -\\ncreating \" language and an \"individual\"  focus  can federal \\nstatutes conceivably create Section 1983 -enforceable \\nrights .  Id. at 284, 286.  Policy -focused language —like a \\nprovision that  \"[n]o funds shall be made available \" to \\n\"any educational agency or institution which has a pol-\\nicy or practice of permitting the release  of [students\\'] \\neducation records\" without parents\\' written consent —\\nfails that bar .  Id. at 279 (quoting 20 U.S.C.  1232g(b)(1) ). \\nEven after Gonzaga  was decided in 2002 , courts of \\nappeals continued to mix statutory analysis of a partic-\\nular provision with  a more freewheeling inquiry into \\nquestions like whether Congress \"intended that the \\nprovision in question benefit the plaintiff .\"  Planned \\nParenthood Arizona Inc.  v. Betlach , 727 F.3d 960, 966 \\n(9th Cir. 2013) (quoting Blessing , 520 U.S. at 341) , cert. \\ndenied, 571 U.S. 1198 (2014) .  This Court i n Talevski  put \\na stop to  that approach, instructing that Gonzaga  alone \\n\"sets the standard for determining when a Spending \\nClause statute confers individual rights.\"  599 U.S. at \\n193 (Barrett,  J., concurring).  Talevski emphasized how \\n\"stringent\" that standard is, and how infrequently it \\nwill be met.  Id. at 186 (majority opinion) .  Only in the \\n\"atypical case\" will Spending Clause legislation clear \\nthe \"significant hurdle\"  of an unambiguous conferral of \\nindividual rights.   Id. at 183 -184.  Thus , \"§ 1983 actions \\nare the exception —not the rule —for violations of \\nSpending Clause statutes.\"  Id. at 193 -194 (Barrett, J., \\nconcurring).    \\n20'}\n",
      "{'B. The any-qualified-provider provision does not unambiguously confer individual federal rights': '1. This Court\\'s cases illustrate the hallmarks of un-\\nusual, rights -conferring provisions versus features that \\ndo not suffice .   \\nOn one end of the spectrum, Talevski  exemplifies the \\n\"atypical case\" where Congress clearly and unambigu-\\nously created individual -focused rights enforceable un-\\nder Section 1983 .  599 U.S. at 183.  Again, Talevski  in-\\nvolved two provisions of a statute governing nursing \\nhomes that Congress appended to the federal Medicaid \\nstatute.  One required nursing homes to \"protect and pro-\\nmote\" residents\\' \"right to be free from\" certain \"physi-\\ncal or chemical restraints.\"  42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(1)(A)(ii).  \\nThe second provided that nursing homes \"must not \\ntransfer or discharge [a] resident\" unless certain pre-\\nconditions were satisfied.  42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(2)(A)  and \\n(B).  To parse those provisions, this Court began with \\ntheir \"place in the overall statutory scheme .\"  Talevski , \\n599 U.S. at 184.   Both provisions were housed in a sub-\\nsection of the statute tit led \"Requirements relating to \\nresidents\\' rights .\"  Id. at 184-185 (citation s omitted) .  Ze-\\nroing  in on the provisions\\' text, the Court observed that \\nthey made multiple  references to an individual benefi-\\nciary (the \"resident\"), and several express references  \\nto \"rights.\"  Ibid.  The Court held that the combined ef-\\nfect of the text and structure \"inexorably\" recognized \\nindividual rights enforceable under Section 1983 .  Id. at \\n192.  Even then, the Court considered whether other \\nstatutory features rebutted that unambiguous rights -\\ncreating language  by suggesting that Congress  had \\nruled  out Section 1983 remedies.  Id. at 186 -191.   \\nMany other types of provisions fall short .  Consider \\nthe provision in Gonzaga :  \"No funds shall be made \\n21 \\n available under any applicable program to any educa-\\ntional agency or institution which has a policy or prac-\\ntice of permitting the release of [students\\'] education \\nrecords       without the written consent of their par-\\nents.\"  20 U.S.C. 1232g(b)(1).  That nondisclosure provi-\\nsion include s no \"\\u200a\\'rights -creating \\' language ,\" \"speak[s] \\nonly to the Secretary of Education,\" and concerns only \\nwhether entities have a generalized policy that would \\ndisqualify them from funding .  Gonzaga , 536 U.S. at  \\n287-288 (citation omitted) .  Further, institutions needed \\nto comply only \"substantially\" to avoid termination of \\nfunding.  Id. at 288.  The absence of any mention of \\n\"rights,\" the provision\\'s focus on the Secretary rather \\nthan individuals, and its placement in a substantial -\\ncompliance  regime all foreclosed Section 1983 enforce-\\nment . \\nOr take the Medicaid provision in Armstrong , 42 \\nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(30)(A) , which require s state plans to \\n\"provide such methods and procedures \" as necessary to \\nassure that \"care and services are available under the \\nplan at least to the extent    available to the general \\npopulation in the geographic area.\"  In a footnote, Arm-\\nstrong  explained that the medical -provider plaintiffs  \\nhad not tried to bring a suit under Section 1983 , even \\nthough Wilder  had found a privately enforceable right \\nfor a nearby Medicaid provision  requiring state plans to \\nprovide \"for payment\" of certain services through \"rea-\\nsonable and adequate \" reimbursement rates.   575 U.S . \\nat 33 0 n.; 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(13)(A) (1982).4  The Court \\napproved of that strategic decision \"since our later opin-\\nions plainly repudiate the ready implication of a § 1983 \\naction that Wilder  exemplified.\"  575 U.S. at 33 0 n..   \\n \\n4  The provision in Wilder  has since been repealed.  See Balanced \\nBudget Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 105 -33, § 4711, 111 Stat. 507 -508. \\n22 \\n 2. Applying th ose precedents , the any -qualified -\\nprovider provision of the Medicaid statute , 42 U.S.C. \\n1396a(a)(23)(A)  cannot surmount  the \"demanding bar\"  \\nfor unmistakably clear , rights -conferring language.   \\nTalevski , 599 U.S. at 180.  The statutory \"text and struc-\\nture\" do not reveal the requisite  unambiguous conferral  \\nof individual rights .  Gonzaga , 536 U.S. at 286.   \\n a. The Court in Talevski  began by focusing on the \\nFNHRA provisions\\'  \"place in the overall statutory \\nscheme.\"  599 U.S. at 184 (citation omitted).  The Court \\nobserved that the provisions were set off from the rest \\nof the statute in a subsection expressly titled \"Require-\\nments relating to residents\\' rights .\"  Ibid.  (quoting 42 \\nU.S.C. 1396r(c)).  That  distinctive place in the statute  \\nwas, at the outset , \"indicative of an individual rights -\\ncreating focus.\"  Ibid.  (citation omitted).   \\nBeginning in the same place here, the any-qualified -\\nprovider provision lacks any special, distinctive place  \\nin Section 1396a(a).  The any -qualified -provider provi-\\nsion is housed in 42 U.S.C. 1396a, a section titled \"State \\nplans  for medical assistance.\"  Subsection (a) of that \\nstatute, titled \"Contents,\" includes 87 paragraphs of re-\\nquirements for state Medicaid plans, of which the any -\\nqualified -provider provision is number 23.  See 42 \\nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(1) -(87).  Those paragraphs ar e not ar-\\nranged in any discernible order, let alone  under  sub-\\nheadings that mention \"rights.\"  See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a).   \\nMany of the surrounding 86 paragraphs in 42 U.S.C. \\n1396a(a) lack even arguably rights -conferring  language .  \\nFor example, paragraph  (a)(58) requires state plans to \\nprovide for the development of a certain \"written de-\\nscription of the law of the State .\"  42 U.S.C. \\n1396 a(a)(58).  And paragraph (a)(6) requires state plans \\nto \"provide that the State [Medicaid] agency will make \\n23 \\n such reports, in such form and containing such infor-\\nmation, as the Secretary may from time to time re-\\nquire.\"  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(6).  That is simply a report-\\ning requirement —a generalized \" \\u200a\\'policy or practice\\' \\u200a\" of \\nthe sort this Court held does not confer individual \\nrights.  Gonzaga , 536 U.S. at 288 -289.  Section 1396a(a) \\nincludes many other similarly generalized policies.5  \\nSome  were added in the same amendments as the any -\\nqualified -provider provision.  See , e.g., Social Security \\nAmendments of 1967, Pub. L. No. 90 -248, § § 227-229, 81 \\nStat. 903 -905.  Paragraph  (a)(24), for example, requires \\nstate plans to \"provide for consultative services by \\nhealth agencies\" to \"hospitals, nursing homes,\" and \\nother institutions.  § 228(a)(3), 81 Stat. 904 (codified as \\namended at 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(24) ). \\nIt is not apparent  why Congress would have buried \\na rights -conferring provision deep within  a long list rid-\\ndled with  generalized policies.  If Congress intended to \\nsingle out the any -qualified -provider provision as the \\n\"atypical case,\" one would expect the statutory struc-\\nture to reflect that choice, as in Talevski . \\nb. Section 1396a(a)(23)\\'s place in the broader Medi-\\ncaid statute reinforces its lack of special, Section 1983 -\\nenforceable features .  This Court has already observed \\nthat provisions in a substantial -compliance regime for \\nStates are less likely to trigger Section 1983.  Gonzaga , \\n536 U.S. at 288.   A substantial -compliance regime tends \\nto indicate  a focus  on the \"aggregate practices \" of the \\n \\n5  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(1) ( State plan must \"provide that\" \\nit \"shall be in effect in all political subdivisions of the State\"); 42 \\nU.S.C. 1396a(a)(59) (State must \"maintain a list\" of \"all physicians \\nwho are certified to participate under the State plan\"); 42 U.S.C. \\n1396a(a)(7 1) (State  plan must  \"provide that the State will implement \\nan asset verification program \"). \\n24 \\n funding recipient , not \"whether the needs of any partic-\\nular person have been satisfied.\"  Does v. Gillespie , 867 \\nF.3d 1034, 104 2 (8th Cir. 2017)  (citation omitted); Gon-\\nzaga , 536 U.S. at 288 (citation omitted).   \\nThe Medicaid statute is a case in point:  a State need \\nonly \"comply substantially\" with Section 1396a(a)  re-\\nquirements  to continue receiving federal  funding.  42 \\nU.S.C. 1396c(2).   Congress has even authorized the Sec-\\nretary to waive entirely States \\' compliance with Section \\n1396a(a) requirements  under certain circumstances.   \\nE.g., 42 U.S.C. 1315(a)(1) (authorizing waivers for States  \\nto conduct pilot project s).  As in Gonzaga , the fact that \\nCongress tied federal funding to substantial compliance  \\nwith Section 1396a(a)(23) and its brethren —and permit-\\nted States  not to comply at all if the Secretary grants  \\na waiver —undercuts the inference that Section \\n1396a( a)(23) unambiguously secures individual rights.   \\nc. In Talevski , the Court then evaluated the text  \\nof the at -issue provisions alongside their place in the \\nstatutory scheme.  See 599 U.S. at 185.  There , the re-\\ncurrent references to \"rights\" in various levels of  \\nsubprovisions —and to \" residents \" in the specific provi-\\nsions —showed that Congress was unmistakably confer-\\nring Section 1983 -enforceable rights.  That same ap-\\nproach yields the opposite inference  here :  Section \\n1396a(a)(23)\\'s text, read in context, does not confer in-\\ndividual rights with the requisite clarity.  \\nFirst, Section 1396a(a)(23)  lacks \"explicit rights -\\ncreating\" language.  Gonzaga , 536 U.S. at 284.  Again, \\nthe nursing -home provisions in Talevski  were replete \\nwith references to \"rights\":  nursing homes were  \\nrequired  to protect \"the right  to be free from\" certain \\nrestraints, and the provisions were  nestled within sub-\\nheadings concerning \"requirements relating to \\n25 \\n residents\\' rights \" and \"transfer and discharge rights .\"  \\n599 U.S. at 184 -185 (brackets and citations omitted).  \\nBut Section 1396a(a)(23)\\'s any -qualified -provider provi-\\nsion never mentions \"rights,\" let alone repeatedly.  \\nWhile \"rights\" is not a magic word, the dearth of even \\nsynonyms for \"rights\" in Section 1396a(a)(23) makes it \\nharder to read the provision to unambiguously confer \\nthem .  \\nThe closest that Section 1396a(a)(23) comes is the \\nphrase \"may obtain \":  state plans must provide that an \\neligible individual \" may obtain \" care from \"any institu-\\ntion,\" \"qualified to perform the service\" required, \"who \\nundertakes to provide him such services .\"  42 U.S.C. \\n1396a(a)(23)(A)  (emphasis added); s ee Br. in Opp. 25.  In \\nisolation, that phrase could  be read as a freestanding \\nguarantee that beneficiaries \"may obtain\" medical care \\nfrom their choice of qualified provider .  But other parts \\nof the text undercut that reading . \\nSection 1396a(a)(23)  lacks an \"unmistakable focus on \\nthe benefited class.\"   Talevski , 599 U.S. at 186 (citation \\nomitted).   In Talevski , the nursing -home provisions at \\nissue, found in Section  1396r, were not directives to \\nStates about what to include in plans or instructions to \\nthe Secretary about preconditions State plans had to \\nmeet to obtain approval.  Those provisions instead de-\\nscribed \"rights\" for individual nursing -home patients \\nthrougho ut.  Here, however, while Section 1396a(a)(23) \\nmentions \"individua l[s]\" who benefit from the federal -\\nState bargain to furnish medical care, individual bene-\\nficiaries are not the focus in the same way.  Read as a \\nwhole, Section 1396a(a)(23) is directed to two other ac-\\ntors:  the States and the Secretary .   \\nAs to the States, all of Section 1396a(a) instructs \\nStates what the required \"Contents\" of their state plans \\n26 \\n must be.  Language in Section 1396a(a)(23)  shifts the \\nfocus to States further, granting them the authority to \\ndecline to provide payments to certain  providers \"con-\\nvicted of a felony\"  and to \"determine[]\"  which felony \\nconvictions  should qualify.  See 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(23) .   \\nMeanwhile, Section 1396a is ultimately directed to \\nthe Secretary  of HHS, since the provision\\'s reticulated \\nprescriptions for plans tell the Secretary what to look \\nfor before approving a State plan .  See 42 U.S.C. \\n1396a(b)) (\" The Secretary shall approve any plan which  \\nfulfills the conditions specified in subsection (a).\") ; see \\nGillespie , 867 F.3d at 1041 .  That feature of the statute \\nled a  plurality of this Court in Armstrong to conclude \\nthat a nearby  provision , 42 U.S.C. 1396a (a)(30)(A), \"is \\nphrased as a directive to the federal agency charged \\nwith approving state Medicaid plans, not as a conferral \\nof the right to sue upon the beneficiaries.\"  575 U.S.  \\nat 331  (plurality opinion) .  In sum, t he any -qualified -\\nprovider provision  \"serve[s] primarily to direct the Fed-\\neral Government\\'s distribution of public funds.\"  Talev-\\nski, 599 U.S. at 183 -184 (brackets and citation omitted).  \\nCongress could have taken another approach .  As \\nTalevski  illustrates, even within the Medicaid frame-\\nwork, Congress knows how to create individual rights .  \\nThe FNHRA is part of the Medicaid statute, and state \\nplans must provide for compliance with its provisions   \\nto be approved by the Secretary.  See 42 U.S.C. \\n1396a(a)(28)(A).   But Congress did not purport to confer \\nindividual rights through that state -plan requirement. \\nInstead, Congress created a separate, separately subti-\\ntled provision focused expressly on  rights , see Talevski , \\n599 U.S. at 18 4, and cross -referenced that section in the \\nstate -plan requirements for purposes of the Secretary\\'s \\nevaluation of plan compliance .  Had Congress wanted to \\n27 \\n create similarly enforceable individual rights to choose \\nany qualified provider, Congress could have taken the \\nsame tack .'}\n",
      "{'C. Finding a privately enforceable individual right in this case would create line-drawing problems': 'If Section 1396a(a)(23) creates privately enforceable \\nrights, many analogous provisions sprinkled through-\\nout the Medicaid statute and similar  federal benefits \\nprograms presumptively might as well .  Far from being \\n\"atypical\" exceptions, rights -creating provisions could \\nswallow the \"rule,\" contravening this Court\\'s admoni-\\ntions in Talevski , 599 U.S. at 183 ; id. at 193 (Barrett, J., \\nconcurring).  Other Spending Clause statutes likewise \\ninclude state -plan requirements that refer to \"individu-\\nals\" and their benefi ts.  But respondents offer no prin-\\ncipled way to draw lines between which of those provi-\\nsions confer individual rights and which do not.  That \\nrespondents\\' theory could potentially make many other \\nSpending Clause provisions privately enforceable is an \\nadditional reason to reject it, given Talevski \\'s directive \\nthat Section 1983 enforcement of Spending Clause leg-\\nislation is meant to be atypical . \\nScattered among the generalized state -plan policies \\nin Section 1396a are several other provisions that, like \\nSection 1396a(a)(23)\\'s any -qualified -provider provision, \\nrefer to \"individual\" beneficiaries .  For example,  para-\\ngraph (a)(12) requires Medicaid plans to \"provide that, \\nin determining whether an individual is blind, there \\nshall be an examination by a physician skilled in the dis-\\neases of the eye or by an optometrist, whichever the in-\\ndividual may select.\"  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a) (12).  Like  the \\nany-qualified -provider provision, paragraph (a)(12) ref-\\nerences an \"individual\" and suggests that the plan must \\nprovide that he \" may  select\" the eye specialist of his \\n28 \\n choice.  If the words \"individual\" and \"may\" suffice  to \\nunambiguously confer Section 1983 -enforceable  rights \\nin paragraph  (a)(23)\\'s any -qualified -provider provision , \\nthen presumably they would  unambiguously confer \\nrights in  paragraph  (a)(12), too. \\nOther provisions with similar phrasing  crop up \\namidst  Section 1396a (a)\\'s 87 paragraphs  in no discerni-\\nble order .  See pp. 22-23, supra .  Take paragraph (a)(3) , \\nwhich  requires state plans to \"provide for granting an \\nopportunity for a fair hearing before the State agency \\nto any individual whose claim for medical assistance un-\\nder the plan is denied or not acted upon with reasonable \\npromptness.\"  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(3).  Or paragraph  \\n(a)(26):  state plans must  provide , \"with respect to each \\npatient receiving\" certain services,  for \"a written plan \\nof care.\"  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)( 26).  Or consider  paragraph  \\n(a)(53):  state plans are to  provide \"for notifying in a \\ntimely manner all [eligible] individuals \" of \"the availa-\\nbility of benefits furnished by the special supplemental \\nnutrition program.\"   42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(53).    \\nOther examples include paragraph (a)(32), which re-\\nquires States to provide that \"no payment \" for care \\n\"provided to an individual shall be made to anyone other \\nthan such individual,\" or paragraph (a)(84), which re-\\nquires state plans  to provide that they will not termi-\\nnate coverage \"for an individual who is an eligible juve-\\nnile\" because he is \"an inmate of a public institution .\"  \\n42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(32) ; 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(84) (2018 ); \\nsee Pet. Br. 37 -40.   \\nUnder respondents\\' theory, these provisions would \\nalso trigger Section 1983.  And the line -drawing difficul-\\nties these provisions present under that approach are \\nalready apparent.  Lower courts  have found some of \\nthose provisions to be rights -conferring, but others not \\n29 \\n to be .  See, e.g., Shakhnes  v. Berlin , 689 F.3d 244, 247 \\n(2d Cir. 2012)  (finding a privately enforceable right in \\nparagraph  (a)(3)) , cert. denied, 569 U.S. 918 (2013) ; \\nAliser  v. SEIU California , 419 F. Supp. 3d 1161, 1168 \\n(N.D. Cal. 2019) (holding that paragraph (a)(32) \"does \\nnot create an individually enforceable right\") .   \\nTreating Section 1396a(a)(23) as a Section 1983 - \\nenforceable provision would open the door for similar \\nprovisions —and the attendant line -drawing problems —\\nin other Spending Clause statutes.  The Food and Nu-\\ntrition  Act of 2008 , 7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq. , includes a long \\nlist of state -plan requirements  mention ing individual \\n\"households ,\" including  that the State shall \"promptly \\ndetermine the eligibility of each applicant household\"  \\nfor supplemental nutrition assistance benefits .  7 U.S.C. \\n2020(e)(3); see Briggs v. Bremby , 792 F.3d 239 (2d Cir. \\n2015) (finding Section 1983 -enforceable right ).  The fed-\\neral adoption -assistance statute requires state plans to , \\namong other things,  provide  for a \"fair hearing\" to \"any \\nindividual\" whose claim for benefits is denied or not \\nacted upon with \"reasonable promptness.\"   42 U.S.C. \\n671(a)(12); see ASW  v. Oregon , 424 F.3d 970 , 978 (9th \\nCir. 2005)  (finding Section 1983 -enforceable right ), cert. \\ndenied, 549 U.S. 812 (2006) .  And o ther b enefits statutes \\nrequire state plans  to provide that assistance \"shall be \\nfurnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible in-\\ndividuals .\"  E.g., 42 U.S.C. 302(a)(8), 1202(a)(11).  Those \\nprovisions also mention individual beneficiaries and \\nspecific benefits.  Respondents\\' theory offers no way to \\ndistinguish between these provisions.  And t hose broad \\nconsequences for  analogous provisions suggest that \\nSection 1396a(a)(23) cannot qualify as the \"atypical \\ncase\" of a privately enforceable Spending Clause provi-\\nsion.  See Talevski , 599 U.S. at 183.   \\n30'}\n",
      "{'D. Other enforcement mechanisms protect beneficiaries': 'Just because Section 1396a(a)(23) is not privately en-\\nforceable does not leave beneficiaries without protec-\\ntion.  Alternative enforcement mechanisms protect in-\\ndividual beneficiaries\\' interests, both with respect to \\nthe any -qualified -provider provision and other similarly \\nworded state -plan provisions.  If anything, those mech-\\nanisms cut further against the notion tha t Congress un-\\nmistakably designated Section 1396a(a)(23) as a trigger \\nfor Section 1983 suits.   The existence of an alternative \\n\"mechanism that Cong ress chose to provide for enforc-\\ning\" certain provisions \"buttress e[s]\" the \"conclusion \\nthat [those ] provisions fail to confer enforceable rights.\"  \\nGonzaga , 536 U.S. at 289.  \\nThe primary enforcement mechanism for Spending \\nClause legislation is the termination of federal funding.  \\nTalevski , 599 U.S. at 183; see 42 U.S.C. 1396c(2).  In ad-\\ndition, t he Secretary has rejected plan amendments \\nthat fail to satisfy the any -qualified -provider provision \\nand leave individual beneficiaries with insufficient \\nchoice among qualified providers.  See, e.g., Letter  from \\nThomas A. Scully, Admin. , Dep\\'t of Health & Human \\nServs., to Kathryn A. Plan t, Dir., N.J. Div. of Med. As-\\nsistance & Health Servs.  (Sept. 19, 2002) . \\nThe Secretary has also required States to give pro-\\nviders the right to an administrative appeal of their ex-\\nclusion from Medicaid.  See 42 C.F.R. 1002.213.  Re-\\nspondents contend that it would have been futile for \\nPlanned Parenthood to pursue  such  an appeal given \\nthat South Carolina terminated its enrollment pursuant \\nto state law.  Br. in Opp. 15 n.2.  But predicted outcomes \\nin individual cases do not make the procedure an  \\nineffective remedy across the board.  States terminate \\nproviders\\' participation in Medic aid for different  rea-\\n31 \\n sons, many of which are well suited to challenge in the \\nadministrative appeals process.  The existence of that \\nalternative mechanism for challenging the termination \\nof a particular provider thus \"buttresse [s]\" the conclu-\\nsion that Congress did not intend to create a privately \\nenforceable right for beneficiaries under Section 1983.  \\nGonzaga , 536 U.S. at 289.   \\nGiven the availability of alternative remedies, find-\\ning a Section 1983 -enforceable right in this case  \"would \\nresult in a curious system\"  of duplicative enforcement.   \\nGillespie , 867 F.3d at 1041 ; see Pet. Br. 42 -43.  Provid-\\ners would  be able to  challenge their disqualification  \\nin state administrative proceedings while individuals \\nwere challenging the same decision in federal court , po-\\ntentially rendering conflicting decisions.  See ibid.  \\nSubjecting States to competing litigation might also  \\n\"dissuade state officials from making decisions that \\nthey believe to be in the public interest \" when amending \\nor implem enting their Medicaid plans.  Gee v. Planned \\nParenthood of Gulf Coast, Inc. , 586 U.S. 1057, 105 8 \\n(2018) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) .   \\nFor other state -plan provisions that mention \"indi-\\nviduals,\" see pp. 27-29, supra , additional enforcement \\nmechanisms may be available.  For example, Section \\n1396a (a)(3)  requires state plans to provide for fair hear-\\nings  for individuals whose claims for  medical assistance  \\nare denied .  42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(3) .  By federal regula-\\ntion, s tate fair-hearing system s must  \"meet the due pro-\\ncess standards set forth in Goldberg  v. Kelly , 397 U.S. \\n254 (1970 ),\" 42 C.F.R. 431.205 (d), and provide the op-\\nportunity for a hearing when an individual claims  that \\nthe State has erroneously terminated, suspended, or re-\\nduced his Medicaid benefits or eligibility , 42 C.F.R. \\n431.201, 431.220 .  And a s those federal regulations  \\n32 \\n reflect, the  Due Process Clause  independently requires \\nnotice and a fair hearing before States can deprive indi-\\nviduals of particular entitlements.   See Goldberg , 397 \\nU.S. 254.   Rejecting respondents\\' broad theory of pri-\\nvate enforcement here thus would not leave individual \\nbeneficiaries without a remedy .'}\n",
      "{'II. The court of appeals erred in finding an individual federal right': 'The Fourth Circuit\\'s decision allowing respondents\\' \\nSection 1983 action misapplied this Court\\'s cases and \\ncontravened this Court\\'s recent admonitions about the \\nrarity of rights -conferring provisions.  The court fo-\\ncused on isolated language in the any -quali fied-provider \\nprovision\\'s text but failed to properly  consider how Sec-\\ntion 1396a(a)(23) fits within Section 1396a(a) and the \\nMedicaid statute writ large . \\n 1.

App. \\n27a-31a. \\nThe court of appeals downplayed  the any -qualified -\\nprovider provision\\'s place in the broader statute  be-\\ncause the Court in Wilder \"already held that a different \\nfunding condition enumerated in § 1396a(a) confers in-\\ndividual  rights enforceable via 42 U.S.C. §  1983 .\"  See \\nPet. App. 27a -28a.  As discussed, Wilder \\'s reasoning has \\nbeen repudiated.  See p . 21, supra .  Wilder  supplies a \\ncautionary tale, not interpretive instruction.  \\nThe court of appeals also invok ed a separate statu-\\ntory provision,  42 U.S.C. 1320a -2, which  provides, in rel-\\nevant part:  \\nIn an action brought to enforce a provision of [the \\nSocial Security Act], such provision is not to be \\ndeemed unenforceable because of its inclusion in a \\nsection of this chapter  requiring a  State  plan or spec-\\nifying the required contents of a  State  plan.  This \\nsection is not intended to limit or expand the grounds \\nfor determining the availability of private actions to \\nenforce  State  plan requirements other than by \\n34 \\n overturning any such grounds applied in Suter v. \\nArtist M., 112 S. Ct. 1360 (1992), but not applied in \\nprior Supreme Court decisions .  \\nIbid.   The court of appeals seemed to read Section \\n1320a -2 as a directive to consider whether a provision, \\nin isolation , \"speak[s] in clear and unambiguous terms,\" \\nPet. App. 29a, and to place no weight on wheth er the pro-\\nvision is a state -plan requirement.  That was error.  Sec-\\ntion 1320a -2 prohibits courts from deeming provisions \\nunenforceable under Section 1983 merely because of \\ntheir inclusion in a state plan .  See Midwest Foster Care \\n& Adoption Ass\\'n v. Kincade , 712  F.3d 1190, 1200 (8th \\nCir. 2013).   It does not require courts to ignore entirely \\nthe contextual significance of a provision\\' s placement in \\na list of state -plan requirements.  \\nFor similar reasons, the court of appeals was wrong \\nto dismiss the argument that \"the overlay of a substan-\\ntial compliance regime indicates\" that Section \\n1396a(a)(23) \"has an aggregate rather than individual \\nfocus .\"  Pet. App. 30a.  The court noted that Wilder  and \\nTalevski  both involved provisions within substantial -\\ncompliance regimes.  Ibid.   But again,  Wilder  supplies \\nno interpretive guidance.  And Talevski  did consider  \\nbroad  features of the Medicaid program , including that \\nthe typical remedy for noncompli ance with state -plan \\nrequirements is to cut off federal funds.  599 U.S . at 181-\\n182.  The Court simply found those features outweighed \\nby the FNHRA\\'s  recurrent, explicit textual and struc-\\ntural focus on individuals and their \"rights.\"  See id. at \\n183.  Talevski thus  shows that courts should consider \\nthe broader statutory context ; what courts cannot do is \\ntreat placement in a list of state -plan requirements as \\nthe beginning and end of the analysis.   \\n35 \\n 3. In an earlier decision, t he court of appeals also \\nmisread  this Court\\'s decision in O\\'Bannon  v. Town \\nCourt Nursing Center , 447 U.S. 773 (1980) .  See Pet. \\nApp. 62a -63a.6  The court of appeals stated that to the \\nextent O\\'Bannon  is relevant, it \"supports the existence \\nof a private right ,\" because of a statement in the deci-\\nsion that  Section 1396a(a)(23) gives Medicaid recipients \\n\"\\u200a\\'the right  to choose among a range of qualified provid-\\ners.\\'\\u200a\" Pet. App. 62a -63a (quoting O\\'Bannon , 447 U.S. at \\n787)  (emphases added and omitted).   \\nThe court of appeals read O\\'Bannon \\'s language  out \\nof context.   O\\'Bannon  was a due -process case, not a Sec-\\ntion 1983 right -of-action case.  The Court held that \\nPennsylvania did not violate the Due Process Clause by \\nterminating  a nursing home\\'s participation in  the state \\nMedicaid plan  without first holding a hearing , because \\nSection 1396a(a)(23)  does not create a cognizable prop-\\nerty  interest for Medicaid recipients \"to enter an un-\\nqualified home and demand a hearing to certify it.\"  \\nO\\'Bannon , 447 U.S.  at 785.   As an aside, O\\'Bannon  ob-\\nserved that Section 1396a(a)(23) purportedly did create \\n\"the right to choose among a range of qualified  provid-\\ners.\"  Ibid.  But t o the extent O\\'Bannon was recognizing \\nany \"right\" in that passage, it was a property interest \\nsounding in due process , not an unambiguous  conferral \\nof a Section 1983 -enforceable statutory right.    \\nMoreover, read in context, O\\'Bannon \\'s discussion of \\nrights actually  cuts against finding a privately enforce-\\nable right  here .  For purposes of due process , O\\'Bannon  \\nheld that Section 1396a(a)(23) \"clearly does not confer\" \\n \\n6 The court of appeals discussed O\\'Bannon  in its second decision, \\nwhich this Court subsequently vacated in light of Talevski .  See Pet. \\nApp. 62a -63a.  The court  of appeals then declined to revisit  its \"pre-\\nvious determinations\" on remand.  Id. at 12a.  \\n36 \\n the very right  that respondents assert here :  the right \\nto challenge  a State\\'s  termination of a particular pro-\\nvider as unqualified .  447 U.S. at 785 -786.  It would make \\nlittle sense to interpret the same provision as \"unam-\\nbiguously \" conferring an individual right to bring such \\na challenge via Section 1983 .'}\n"

No person \\nother than amici curiae or their counsel made a monetary \\ncontribution to its preparation or submission. Each party \\nconsented to the filing of this brief in accordance with Supreme \\nCourt Rule 37.3. \\n2 \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\nThe Sixth Circuit\\'s overly expansive interpretation of \\nthe Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\" or the \"Act\") \\nmandates disproportional and unconstitutional \\npunishment of juvenile offenders in violation of the \\nEighth Amendment. ACCA\\'s sentencing \\nenhancement provision explicitly applies to children \\nand includes certain juvenile delinquency \\nadjudications as qualifying predicates for imposition \\nof its mandatory minimum sentencing requirement. \\nThe Sixth Circuit\\'s broad construction of the \\n\"different occasions\" language of the Act sweeps even \\nmore juvenile conduct into ACCA\\'s domain further \\ncompromising the ability of the sentencer to consider \\nthe infirmities of youth and impose a constitutionally \\nproportional sentence. In expanding the reach of \\nACCA beyond the intent of Congress, the Sixth \\nCircuit paves the way for excessive and potentially \\nunconstitutional sentences for child offenders. This \\nerroneous interpretation presents an unacceptable \\nrisk of inflicting permanent, debilitating sentencing \\nconsequences on children that lack any legitimate \\npenological justification and is thus inconsistent with \\nthis Court\\'s prior rulings that children are different \\nfrom adults and these differences neccissitate \\nheightened constituitonal protections. \\nThis Court has examined the parameters of \\njuvenile culpability on multiple occasions, \\nconsistently holding that kids cannot be held \\naccountable according to adult standards because of \\ntheir underdeveloped brains The Court has \\nrepeatedly reaffirmed, as recently as this year, that \\nthe circumstances leading to juvenile crime are \\n3 \\ntransient, not permanent, and as such are \\ninconsistent with designation of a child as an \\n\"irredeemable, career criminal.\" Constitutionally \\nacceptable juvenile sentencing instead requires \\nconsideration of all the mitigating factors associated \\nwith youth in general, as well as the specific situation \\nof the offender, with rehabilitation as the primary \\ngoal. \\nThe Sixth Circuit\\'s expansive interpretation of \\nACCA, however, contravenes this directive as it \\nwould result in even more children entering \\nadulthood permanently branded as career criminals, \\nsolely as a result of conduct precipitated by their still \\ndeveloping brains. Tragically, the consequences of \\nthis fleeting state of neurophysiological development, \\nover which they have no control and which they will \\noutgrow, will persist, relegating them to an adult life \\nof diminished opportunities at best, and incontestible \\nfelonious status, at worst. \\nUnder the Sixth Circuit\\'s reading of ACCA\\'s \\n\"different occasions\" language, circumstances this \\nCourt has previously described as transient will \\ninstead become a permanent albatross around a \\nchild\\'s neck. A child who exercises poor judgement or \\nsuccombs to peer pressure as a result of cognitive \\nimmaturity, or who has been subject to abuse and \\nneglect, risks being deemed a career criminal in direct \\ncontradiction to what Congress intended. Adopting \\nthe Sixth Circuit\\'s interpretation of the Act would \\ngreatly increase the likelihood of an individual \\nqualifying for an enhancement under the Act even \\nbefore reaching adulthood. This additional stripping \\nof sentencers\\' discretion to consider the actual \\n4 \\ncircumstances triggering offenses committed by kids \\nundermines the rehabilitation goal of this Court\\'s \\njuvenile sentencing precedent. \\nBy allowing sequential actions ocurring on a single \\nnight, at a single location, and in furtherance of a \\nsingle criminal opportunity, to morph into \"career \\ncriminal\" status, the Sixth Circuit has directly \\ncontradicted the plain language and purpose of \\nACCA. The effects of this interpretation are \\nmagnified when children are involved. The statute \\nwas intended to protect the public against hardened, \\nveteran criminals, not children, regardless of the \\nseverity of the crimes they have committed during one \\nday or night of intemperate behavior. Equating an \\nindividual\\'s poor decision-making on a single night \\nwith perpetual and irredeemable criminality is \\nunjustified when applied to adults, and \\nunconscionable when applied to children. \\n5 \\nARGUMENT \\nI. AN EXPANSIVE INTERPRETATION OF THE \\nARMED CAREER CRIMINAL ACT WOULD BE \\nESPECIALLY HARMFUL TO CHILD \\nOFFENDERS. \\nCurrently, some circuits, including the Sixth, \\napply an unjustifiably expansive test to determine \\nwhether previous offenses meet the \"different \\noccasions\" requirement of ACCA. This interpretation \\nis particularly harmful when applied to children in \\nsubjecting even more of them to imposition of ACCA\\'s \\nmandatory 15-year sentencing enhancement \\nprovision than the more common sense reading of the \\nphrase entails. The enhancement would be triggered \\nby convictions for multiple offenses, as well as certain \\njuvenile delinquency determinations, even when the \\nprior transgressions were committed as part of the \\nsame criminal opportunity, conspiracy or spree. 2  \\nGiven the often impulsive behavior of children, \\nespecially adolescents, resulting from their under-\\ndeveloped brains, this analysis could result in child \\noffenders becoming career criminals based solely on \\none night\\'s improvident conduct. 3  \\n2  See, e.g., United States v. Longoria, 874 F.3d 1278 (11th Cir. \\n2017) (finding Adam Longoria was a career criminal based on \\ntwo sales of controlled substances and one count of conspiracy \\nrelated to the sales). \\nUnited States v. Chappel, 801 Fed. App\\'x 379, 383 (6th Cir. \\n2020); see also United States v. Moody, 770 F.3d 577, 580 (7th \\nCir. 2014) (citing Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 15-17 \\n(2005)); United States v. Keesee, 358 F.3d 1217, 1221 (9th Cir. \\n2004) (finding there is no recency requirement and \"[t]he only \\n6'},\n",
       " {\"A. Under the Sixth Circuit's Interpretation of the Statute, Minor Offenders Will Enter Adulthood as Career Criminals.\": 'ACCA does not allow for consideration of the \\ninfirmities of youth in its application of mandatory \\nsentence enhancements. ACCA further includes \\njuvenile adjudications as qualifying offenses, \\nexplicitly including in the definition of a conviction, \"a \\nfinding that a person has committed an act of juvenile \\ndelinquency involving a violent felony.\" 4  \\nACCA\\'s definition of a violent felony further \\nincludes an \"act of juvenile delinquency involving the \\nuse or carrying of a firearm, knife, or destructive \\ndevice that would be punishable by over one year of \\nimprisonment if committed by an adult.\" 5  There is \\n\"no authority to ignore [an otherwise qualified] \\nconviction because of its age or its underlying \\ncircumstances. Such considerations are \\nirrelevant . . . under the Act.\" 6  ACCA has, in fact, \\nbeen applied in cases where all of the predicate \\noffenses were committed by a juvenile offender. 7  \\ntime limitation supported by the language of the Armed Career \\nCriminal Act is that the predicate convictions be \\'previous.1. \\n18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(C). \\n18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2). \\n6  United States v.

ACCA prohibits lower \\ncourts from considering factors that have been \\ndeemed critical by this Court in its Eighth \\nAmendment jurisprudence when sentencing \\nindividuals whose predicate offenses accrued as \\njuveniles. Adoption of the Sixth Circuit\\'s expansive \\ninterpretation of ACCA\\'s \"different occasions\" \\nrequirement will exacerbate this situation leading to \\nextremely harsh sentences for even greater numbers \\nof minors who will be unjustifiably designated as \\n\"career criminals \" \\nAn estimated 76,000 children are prosecuted in \\nthe adult criminal justice system every year in the \\nUnited States. 8  It is difficult, however, to estimate \\nwith any degree of certainty how many individuals \\nare currently incarcerated for crimes they committed \\nas children. 9  As of June 27, 2020, data from the U.S. \\nSentencing Commission revealed that there were 437 \\nEighth Amendment where the defendant had a long rap sheet, \\nincluding the predicate offenses, all committed as a juvenile). \\n8  See Charles Puzzanchera, et al., Youth Younger than 18 \\nProsecuted in Criminal Court: National Estimate, 2015 Cases, \\nNat\\'l Center for Juvenile Justice (2018), available at, \\nhttp://www.cfyj.org/images/Transfer-estimate.pdf  (last accessed \\nMay 9, 2021). \\n9  This data is not readily accessible though there is pending \\nlegislation that would require this information to be maintained. \\nSee H.R. 2908, 117th Congress (2021). \\n8 \\noffenders in BOP custody who had been sentenced to \\n20 years or longer who were under the age of 21 at the \\ntime of sentencing. 10  \\nEven in the absence of precise numbers of \\npotentially affected individuals, the Sixth Circuit\\'s \\ninterpretation raises serious concerns about how \\nACCA could be applied to child offenders. The Act \\nexplicitly allows for prior adjudications in juvenile \\ncourt, as well as prior convictions in adult criminal \\ncourt, to count as predicate offenses.\" This raises a \\nmyriad of additional concerns for child offenders, not \\nthe least of which is that Texas, Wisconsin, and \\nGeorgia exclude 17 year-olds from juvenile court \\naltogether. 12  The practical implication of the practices \\nof these outlier jurisdictions is that an unarmed 17 \\nyear old who burglarizes 10 storage units at the same \\nstorage facility in the same evening would not be \\neligible for an ACCA enhancement in 47 states, but \\nunder the interpretation of the Sixth Circuit, would \\nbe so eligible in the states that exclude 17 year olds \\nfrom juvenile court. 13  \\nThis is just the beginning of what such an \\nerroneous interpretation of ACCA would mean for \\nchild offenders.

The construction of ACCA applied \\nby the Sixth Circuit and other courts affords juveniles \\nlike Mr. Houston-Sconiers and Mr. Blount with no \\nopportunity to learn from a single night\\'s mistakes \\nbefore carrying the permanent designation of a career \\ncriminal In the event that a child is convicted of \\nmultiple charges stemming from a single incident, as \\nin the case of the Petitioner, he or she could face the \\nprospect of being branded a career criminal and \\nsubject to the harsh mandatory minimum sentence \\nthat accompanies such a designation, an outcome that \\nis clearly at odds with this Court\\'s jurisprudence and \\nthe intent of Congress. \\n14  State v.

Simmons, 24  holding that the Eighth and \\nFourteenth Amendments bar the execution of \\ndefendants who were under 18 years of age at the \\ntime of their crime. The Court identified three \\ndifferences between adults and children that \\n\"demonstrate that juvenile offenders cannot with \\nreliability be classified among the worst offenders.\" 25  \\nFirst, the Court explained that a \"lack of maturity and \\nunderdeveloped sense of responsibility are found in \\nyouth more often than in adults and are more \\nunderstandable among the youth,\" resulting in \\n\"impetuous and ill-considered actions and \\ndecisions.\" 28  Second, the Court noted that children \\n\"are more vulnerable or susceptible to negative \\ninfluences and outside pressures, including peer \\npressure.\" 27  Third, and most critically in the context \\nof ACCA\\'s sentencing enhancement provision \\ntargeting irredeemable, \"career criminals,\" the Court \\nfound that \"the character of a juvenile is not as well \\nformed as that of an adult\" with \"more transitory, less \\nfixed\" personality traits. 28  \\n23  Id. at 835. \\n24  543 U.S. 551 (2005). \\n25  Id. at 569. \\n26  Id.

Florida, 32  \\nholding that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the \\nimposition of life without parole sentences for \\njuvenile, non-homicide offenders. The Graham Court \\nreaffirmed Ropeis rationale, embracing research on \\nchild brain development, included in submissions \\nfrom the American Medical Association and American \\nPsychological Association as amid, in finding that \\n\"developments in psychology and brain science \\ncontinue to show fundamental differences between \\n29  Id. \\n3° Id.

Quoting Roper, the Court \\nheld that \"[fit is difficult even for expert psychologists \\nto differentiate between the juvenile offender whose \\ncrime reflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity, \\nand the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects \\nirreparable corruption.\" 34  The Court also relied upon \\nthe \"special difficulties encountered by counsel in \\njuvenile representation\" with respect to juvenile \\nclients characterized by reduced ability to weigh long-\\nterm consequences, impulsiveness, and a reluctance \\nto trust defense counse1. 35  \\nIn Miller v. Alabama, 36  the Court again relied on \\nthese innate attributes of childhood to hold that the \\nEighth Amendment bars mandatory life \\nimprisonment without parole sentences for \\ndefendants who commit their crimes as children. \\nCiting post- Graham psychological studies, the Court \\nexplained that \"the science and social science \\nsupporting Roper\\'s and Graham\\'s conclusions have \\nbecome even stronger.\" 37  In Montgomery v. \\nLouisiana, 38  the Court held that Milleis rule applied \\nretroactively on state collateral review, again relying \\non the reasoning of Roper and Graham.

The empirical \\nresearch supporting the decades of relevant case law \\nconfirms that crimes committed by children are, in all \\nbut the rarest of cases, the product of a transient set \\nof circumstances that do not reflect immutable \\ncharacteristics of the child\\'s identity or predict the \\nchild\\'s future behavior. In conflict with this reality, \\nthe construction of ACCA adopted by the Sixth Circuit \\nbelow would unjustifiably broaden the group of \\nchildren deemed hardened, habitual offenders, \\nincapable of rehabilitation, and thus deserving of \\nACCA\\'s drastic mandatory sentencing enhancement, \\nyet premised solely on a single night of brash \\nbehavior. \\nThe empirically demonstrated differences between \\nthe child and adult brain \"render suspect any \\nconclusion that a juvenile falls among the worst \\noffenders\" 43  and thus could conceivably qualify as a \\n\"career criminal\" under ACCA. The entire premise of \\nACCA\\'s sentencing enhancement — of the \"critical \\nneed to target the habitual offender [and] incarcerate \\nunrehabilitative [sic] repeat violent felons for lengthy \\nperiods\"44  — is thus categorically inapplicable to \\njuveniles, especially when the qualifying prior \\ncriminal conduct took place on a single occasion, as \\nthat term is commonly understood, and does not \\nreflect \"repeat\" behavior in any sense of the term. \\n43  Id. (italics added) \\n44  134 Cong. Rec. 15,806-07 (1988) (statement of Sen. Specter). \\n17 \\nThis Court has found that \"[amn offender\\'s age is \\nrelevant to the Eighth Amendment, and criminal \\nprocedure laws that fail to take defendants\\' \\nyouthfulness into account at all would be flawed.\" 45  \\nMandatory minimum sentences for juvenile offenders \\nundermine the fundamental principle that the \\npurpose of juvenile punishment is rehabilitation. 46  \\nThe Miller Court recognized the importance of \\nconsidering the \"mitigating qualities of youth!\" 47  In \\nfact, the Court found that mitigating factors are more \\nrelevant in the cases of juvenile offenders than they \\nare in the case of adults. 48  Unfortunately, ACCA was \\nnot worded with such considerations in mind as its \\nfocus was on the \"worst of the worst.\" Thus, the \\nstatute\\'s lack of sentencing discretion precludes \\nconsideration of age and all of the factors identified \\nand deemed relevant in Miller. Accordingly, ACCA\\'s \\nbreadth should not in turn be augmented by an overly \\nexpansive reading of the \"different occasions\" \\nlanguage as adopted by the Sixth Circuit. \\nEight circuits apply the ACCA enhancement too \\nbroadly, finding it applicable when crimes are \\ncommitted at different moments, even when \\ncommitted sequentially at the same location and \\n45  Graham, 560 U.S. at 76.

EXPANSIVE INTERPRETATION OF THE \\nARMED CAREER CRIMINAL ACT \\nCONTRAVENES CONGRESSIONAL INTENT \\nAND SHOULD BE NARROWED. \\nUnder ACCA, a defendant convicted of possessing \\na firearm or ammunition in violation of federal law \\nfaces a significantly more severe punishment if he has \\nthree or more previous convictions for a \"violent \\nfelony\" or \"serious drug offense,\" or both, \"committed \\non occasions different from one another.\" 54  In the case \\nbelow, this enhancement caused Mr. Wooden to face \\na mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years in \\nprison, approximately seven times his Sentencing \\nGuidelines range of 21 to 27 months. \\nThe Act defines a violent felony as a felony \\ninvolving the \"use of physical force\" or burglary, \\n53  McElyea, 158 F.3d at 1021. \\n54  18 U.S.C. § 924(e). \\n20 \\narson, extortion, or one involving explosives. 55  The \\ndefinition was previously more expansive, until this \\nCourt invalidated its residual clause in Johnson v. \\nUnited States as confusing, unpredictable, uncertain, \\nand a violation of the Constitutional guarantee of due \\nprocess.56  A serious drug offense is defined as certain \\noffenses involving controlled substances with a \\nmaximum possible sentence of ten years or more. 57  \\nNotwithstanding the \"wide differences\" between the \\njuvenile and adult justice systems, 59  as previously \\ndiscussed, the Act explicitly permits certain \\n\"finding[s] that a person has committed an act of \\njuvenile delinquency\" to serve as a predicate for the \\nsentencing enhancement. 59  \\nWhile the Act defines which previous convictions \\nto consider, it does not specify when these offenses are \\ndeemed to be \"committed on occasions different from \\none another.\" 69  The determination of whether a \\nprevious conviction qualifies as a predicate offense \\nand whether to apply ACCA\\'s enhancement at all, as \\nin the present case, often depends on whether this \\nadditional statutory requirement is met . 51  \\n\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2). \\n56  Johnson v.

ACCA was Only Intended to Apply to the \\nNarrow Subset of Irredeemable Offenders \\nIdentified after Multiple Opportunities for \\nRehabilitation. \\nThe legislation that would become ACCA was \\nintroduced in 1981 by Senator Arlen Specter, of \\nPennsylvania, a former district attorney. 62  At the \\ntime, there was a growing recognition that a large \\npercentage of crime is committed by a very small \\npercentage of repeat offenders. 63  \\nOrdinarily, conviction for unlawful possession of a \\nfirearm under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) is subject to a \\nsentence between zero to ten years.\" Senator Specter \\nproposed to mandate life imprisonment without the \\npossibility of a suspended sentence for career \\ncriminals. 65  The final version of the Act mandated a \\nsentence of fifteen years to life. 66  This sentencing \\nenhancement is significant, ,as the mandatory \\nminimum of fifteen years is higher than the \\nmaximum sentence without the enhancement. 67  The \\nresult is that sentences for convictions under § 922(g) \\nfrom 2008 through 2012 without the ACCA \\nenhancement averaged 46 months, compared to an \\nS. 1688, 97th Cong.

      "{'A. Text': 'xt \\n \\n Oklahoma\\'s claim that a Reservation was never established for the Nation in the Indian Territory is divorced from both text and history.  The \\nTreaty of 1866 expressly refers to the Nation\\'s \\nTerritory as a \"Reservation.\"  Art. IX, 14 Stat. 785, 788 (1866).  That was no slip of the pen, but rather reflected the defining characteristics of the Creek territory. \\n \\n The term \"reservation\" has long been \"used in the land law to describe any body of land reserved … from sale for any purpose.  It may be a military \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n6 \\n \\n reservation, or an Indian reservation ... [W]hen \\nCongress has once established a reservation, all tracts included within it remain a part of the reservation \\nuntil separated therefrom by Congress.\"  United \\nStates v. Celestine , 215 U.S. 278, 285 (1909). \\n  The statutory and treaty text creating a new \\nhomeland for the Nation establish that it readily \\nsatisfies this definition.  The Indian Removal Act of 1830 authorized the President to divide public domain lands into defined \"districts \" for tribes removing to \\nthe Indian territory.  § 1, 4 Stat. 411, 411-12.  It \\nfurther provided that the United States would \\n\"forever secure and guar anty\" such lands to the \\nremoved tribes, \"and if they prefer it … the United States will cause a patent … to be made and executed \\nto them for the same[.]\"  § 3, 4 Stat. at 412. \\n  Pursuant to the Act, the Treaty of 1832 provided that \"country west of the Mississippi shall be solemnly guarantied to the Creek Indians,\" and \\n\"also\" that \"a patent\" woul d issue once its boundaries \\nwere ascertained.  Art. XIV, 7 Stat. 366, 368.  Using precise geographic terms, the Treaty of 1833 then \"establish[ed] boundary lines which will secure a ... permanent home to the whole Creek nation,\" carving \\nthat home out of public domain lands that had been \\nceded to the United States by the Quapaw, 7 Stat. 176 (1818), and the Osage, 7 Stat. 183 (1818).  Preamble, art. II, 7 Stat. 417, 418-19.  The Treaty further \\nprovided that the United States would \"grant a \\npatent, in fee simple\" to the Nation.  Art. III, 7 Stat. \\nat 419.  That patent issued  in 1852, reiterating the \\n1833 boundaries verbatim.  Fee Patent, Aug. 11, 1852, Land Title Plant, Muscogee Creek Nation, Book \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n7 \\n \\n 1:748.  After ceding a tract of land to the Seminole \\nNation in 1856, art. I, 11 Stat. 699, 699 (1856), the Nation ceded the western half of its territory to the \\nUnited States in 1866, leaving it with what the Treaty \\ntermed \"the reduced Creek Reservation\" that is the subject of this case, art. IX, 14 Stat. at 788.  \\n These treaties, in sum, set aside lands from the \\npublic domain, and while reducing those lands over time, solemnly promised, in the words of the 1866 \\nTreaty, that the remaining territory would \"be forever set apart as a home for said Creek Nation[.]\"  Art. III, \\n14 Stat. at 786.  They ordained a reservation in the \\nclassic sense, and the 1866 Treaty called it precisely that.      Oklahoma argues that issuance of a fee patent \\nin 1852 divested the Creek territory of reservation \\nstatus.  But the rule nowhere exists that a tribe cannot possess fee title to a reservation.  As the National Congress of American Indians (\"NCAI\") well \\nexplains, nineteenth-century reservations rested on \\nvarious forms of land tenure, with many substantial reservations held by tribes in fee simple.  NCAI Br. 10-13.  Neither this Court nor Congress has deemed title determinative of reservation status, see, e.g., In \\nre New York Indians, 72 U.S. 761, 766-68 (1866) \\n(repeatedly referring to the Seneca Nation\\'s fee simple territories as \"res ervations\").  And in the \\nNation\\'s case any distinction was insubstantial, as its \\npatent was highly restricted:  The Nation could not \\nsell the lands, see 25 U.S.C. § 177, and the United \\nStates retained both a reversionary interest in and supervisory power over them, §§ 3, 7, 4 Stat. at 412; \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n8 \\n \\n see United States v. Creek Nation , 295 U.S. 103, 109-\\n10 (1935).  \\nIt was the treaties that  \"solemnly guarantied\" \\nthe Nation\\'s lands.  Art. XIII, 7 Stat. at 368.  Consistent with the Remo val Act provision that a \\npatent could \"also\" issue, the Creeks received one in \\naddition to, not in substi tution for, the treaty \\npromises.  See Mo., Kan. & Tex. Ry. Co. v. United \\nStates , 47 Ct. Cl. 59, 119 (1911) (Howry, J., \\nconcurring) (\"The patents re sted on treaties[.]\").  \\nIndeed, the 1866 Treaty makes no mention of the \\npatent in \"forever set[ting] apart … a home for said Creek Nation[.]\"  Art. III, 14 Stat. at 786.  It is not surprising, then, that th e patent argument was \\nrejected long ago: \\n \\nThe contention that the Creek Nation \\nis not now an Indian reservation is not tenable....  [N]or can it be successfully maintained that because the United \\nStates [gave the Nation] a fee-simple \\ntitle thereto ... it is not in [the] possession of the Creeks as an Indian reservation. \\n \\nMaxey v.

The Creek had better reason \\nthan most to insist on enhanced protection for treaty promises.  By the 1820s, vast treaty cessions had left them with a \"last enclave of ancestral lands\" in \\nAlabama.  United States v. Creek Nation , 476 F.2d \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n9 \\n \\n 1290, 1293 (Ct. Cl. 1973).  In 1829, Alabama asserted \\njurisdiction over those lands and settlers poured in.  Id. at 1292.  Despite an 1826 treaty that \\n\"guarantee[d]\" the lands to the Creek, art. 13, 7 Stat. \\n286, 288, executive branch officials claimed to be powerless to protect them and urged them to remove.  Creek Nation , 476 F.2d at 1293-94.  See also Grant \\nForeman, Indian Removal  108-09 (1953). \\n  The Removal Act, however, permitted removal only of such tribes \"as may choose\" to go, § 1, 4 Stat. \\nat 412, and the Creek declined.  Foreman at 108.  \\nIncreasing the pressure, Alabama criminalized the functioning of the Creek government in 1832.  Creek \\nNation , 476 F.2d at 1292.  Georgia had taken similar \\nactions against the Cherokee and, in January 1832, \\nthis Court declared such actions \"repugnant to the \\nconstitution.\"  Worcester v. Georgia,  31 U.S. 515, 520, \\n561 (1832).  But within weeks of that decision, Jackson Administration officials again told the Creek \\nthat the government would not protect them and that \\nthey should remove.     The Creek then signed the 1832 Treaty.  While it required them to cede their eastern lands, art. I, 7 \\nStat. at 366, it gave them the option to remain and \\ntake individual allotments within their former territory, art. II, 7 Stat. at 366.  Removal was \\nexplicitly voluntary, art. XII, 7 Stat. at 367.  And \\nshould they stay, the United States promised \\nprotection from \"[a]ll intrud ers.\"  Art. V, 7 Stat. at \\n366.  Hence, the Treaty would allow the Creek to \"remain on land which they held sacred.\"  Creek \\nNation , 476 F.2d at 1294 (quotation marks omitted).   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n10 \\n \\n  Or so they thought.  Once again the Creek \\nended up \"look[ing] in vain for their promised protection\" and their lands \"were quickly overrun….  \\nThe frauds were spectacular and widespread, making \\na mockery of the treaty[.]\"   Francis Paul Prucha, The \\nGreat Father  222 (1984).   Federal agents \"gave \\nthemselves little concern for the promises made to the \\nIndians[.]\"  Foreman at 113.  The intruders took \\nCreek land, shot their livestock, \"burnt and destroyed their houses and corn,\" and \"used violence to their persons.\"  Id. at 114.  The dispossessed Creeks \"still \\nrefused to leave[.]\"  Angie Debo, The Road to \\nDisappearance  100 (1941).  And so it came to pass that \\nin 1836 – in violation of Congress\\'s decree that removal would only be voluntary, the same promise made in the 1832 Treaty, and this Court\\'s decision in \\nWorcester  – the Creeks were rounded up by federal \\ntroops and forcibly removed to the west.  The story of the sufferings they endured on their journey need not be repeated here. \\n \\n It is not surprising that having experienced, at such enormous cost, the willingness of executive branch officials to disregard treaties, statutes, and judicial commands, the Creek insisted on as much \\nprotection as possible for their newly reserved lands.  \\nMore surprising is how Oklahoma distorts this history and argues that a patent intended to provide additional security for the Creek Reservation \\ndismantled it instead.  \"[I]t would be anomalous,\" to \\nsay the least, to hold \"that the treaties conferring upon the Creek Nation a title stronger  than the right \\nof occupancy have left the tribal land base with less \\nprotection, simply because fee title is not \\nformally held by the United States in trust for the \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n11 \\n \\n Tribe.\"  Indian Country, U.S.A., Inc. v. Oklahoma , 829 \\nF.2d 967, 975-76 (10th Cir. 1987).  A treaty is meant to be interpreted \"as the [treating tribe] originally \\nunderstood it ... – not in light of new lawyerly glosses \\nconjured up for litigation ... more than 150 years after the fact.\"  Wash. State Dep\\'t of Licensing v. Cougar \\nDen, Inc. , 139 S. Ct. 1000, 1019 (2019) (Gorsuch, J., \\nconcurring).  Oklahoma\\'s ar gument fails this test – \\nbadly – and should be rejected.  II. The Creek Allotment Act Preserved the \\nNation\\'s Reservation. \\n \\n Just as the underlying patent has no bearing \\non whether the Creek Reservation was established, it is likewise irrelevant to whether the Reservation was \\nlater disestablished.  Disestablishment cases \\ntypically involve statutes transforming communal tenure to individual ownership, and hence transforming the original patent.  Whether that patent was held by a tribe in  restricted fee or in trust \\nby the United States is of no moment.  The question \\nis whether Congress, in altering title within the reservation boundaries, also intended to change those \\nboundaries.  \"Once a block of land is set aside for an \\nIndian reservation and no matter what happens to \\nthe title of individual plots within the area, the entire block retains its reservat ion status until Congress \\nexplicitly indicates otherwise.\"  Solem v. Bartlett , 465 \\nU.S. 463, 470 (1984).  The key to that determination \\nis the language enacted by Congress. \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n12 \\n \\n A. Text \\n \\n While Congress need not use any particular \\nformulation to disestablish a reservation, this Court \\nhas drawn a sharp distinction between text evidencing a \"present and total surrender of all tribal interests,\" Parker , 136 S. Ct. at 1079 (quotation \\nmarks omitted) – including \"[e]xplicit reference to \\ncession\" or abolition of the reservation, \"language providing for the total surrender of tribal claims in exchange for a fixed payment,\" or language \"restor[ing reservation] land  to the public domain,\" id. \\n(quotation marks omitted) (b rackets in original) – and \\ntext simply allotting land among tribal members or \"allow[ing] \\'non-Indian settlers to own land on the reservation,\\'\" id. at 1080  (quoting Seymour v. \\nSuperintendent of Wash. State Penitentiary , 368 U.S. \\n351, 356 (1962).  The Creek Allotment Act of 1901, 31 Stat. 861, falls squarely in the latter category.   The Act allotted almost  all land within the \\nReservation to tribal members.  Section 3 provided \\nthat \"[a]ll lands of said tribe, except as herein \\nprovided, shall be allotted among the citizens of the \\ntribe ... to give each an equal share of the whole in \\nvalue,\" § 3, 31 Stat. at 862, with ensuing sections \\ndetailing the allotment process, §§ 4-9, 31 Stat. at 863-64.  The exceptions were limited.  Lands were reserved for tribal purposes, including schools, cemeteries, and churches.  § 24, 31 Stat. at 868-69.  In \\naddition, towns (occupied principally by noncitizens \\nwith no prior legal claim to Reservation lands, Johnson v. Riddle , 240 U.S. 467, 476-77 (1916)) were \\nto be platted and appraised, § 10, 31 Stat. at 864-66, \\nwith the owners of existing improvements \"hav[ing] \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n13 \\n \\n the right to purchase such lot[ s] by paying one-half of \\nthe appraised value thereof,\" § 11, 31 Stat. at 866, and remaining lots to be sold \"at public auction to the \\nhighest bidder,\" § 14, 31 Stat. at 866.  The proceeds \\nfrom these sales (which by definition were not fixed in sum) were to be paid \"into the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the tribe,\" § 31, 31 Stat. at 870. \\n \\n These provisions evidence no intent to disestablish the Reservation.  This Court has long held that allotment by itse lf simply tr ansforms the \\nnature of the landholdings within a reservation, and \\nhence that \"allotment ... is completely consistent with \\ncontinued reservation status.\"  Mattz v. Arnett, 412 \\nU.S. 481, 497 (1973); see also Celestine , 215 U.S. at \\n288.  The same is true for the townsite provisions, §§ \\n10-22, 31 Stat. at 864-67, which applied to a fraction \\nof the Reservation land base, 1911 Annual Report of the Comm\\'r to the Five Ci vilized Tribes, at 391,\\n2 and \\nfall squarely into Parker \\'s category of non-\\ndisestablishing statutes that \"merely opened reservation land to settlement and provided that the \\nuncertain future proceeds of settler purchases should \\nbe applied to the Indians\\' benefit,\" 136 S. Ct. at 1079-80 (quoting DeCoteau v. District Cty. Court for Tenth \\nJudicial Dist. , 420 U.S. 425, 448 (1975)); see also \\nSeymour , 368 U.S. at 359 (townsite provisions fully \\nconsistent with continued reservation status). \\n   The Act\\'s land provisions contrast sharply with the Treaties of 1832 and 1866, in which the Nation \\n\"cede[d]\" territory to the Unit ed States.  Art. I, 7 Stat. \\nat 366; art. III, 14 Stat. at 786; Resp. Murphy  Br. 25.  \\n \\n2 http://bit.ly/MCN-RCTFCT-1911 . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n14 \\n \\n In Parker , this Court  found that a similar contrast \\nbetween allotment act text and earlier treaty language \"undermine[d]\" Nebraska\\'s diminishment \\nclaim.  136 S. Ct. at 1080.  Moreover, Congress passed \\nacts, contemporaneous with the 1901 Act, that demonstrate that when Congress intended allotment to eradicate reservation boundaries it knew how to \\nsay so.  See, e.g., Act of Apr. 21, 1904, § 8, 33 Stat. 189, \\n217-18 (allotting Ponca and Otoe and Missouria reservations and providing \" further , That the \\nreservation lines of the said ... reservations … are \\nhereby, abolished; and the territory comprising said \\nreservations shall … become part of [three Oklahoma counties]\").  Mattz  cited this very provision in noting \\nthat \"Congress has used cl ear language of express \\ntermination when that result is desired,\" 412 U.S. at \\n504 n.22, and declaring that  \"[t]his being so, we are \\nnot inclined to infer an intent to terminate [a] reservation,\" id. at 504.  The same conclusion follows \\nhere. \\n \\n In fact, even stronger textual evidence of preservation exists because in the Allotment Act Congress expressly recognized the Nation\\'s continuing legislative authority over the Reservation.  \\nWhile Section 47 maintained the Curtis Act\\'s \\nabolition of the Creek courts, \"legislative jurisdiction …. is quite a separate matter from jurisdiction to adjudicate,\"  Hartford Fire  Ins. Co. v. California , 509 \\nU.S. 764, 813 (1993) (quotation marks omitted) \\n(Scalia, J., dissenting).  And Section 42 made plain that the Nation\\'s legislat ive authority persevered: \\n \\nNo act, ordinance, or resolution of the \\nnational council of the Creek Nation in \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n15 \\n \\n any manner affecting the lands of the \\ntribe, or of individuals after allotment, or the moneys or other property of the tribe, \\nor the citizens thereof ... shall be of any \\nvalidity until approv ed by the President \\nof the United States.  When any such act, ordinance, or resolution shall be passed \\nby said council and approved by the \\nprincipal chief, [it] … shall be immediately transmitted to the President, who shall … approve or disapprove the same....  [I]f approved ... \\nit shall be published in at least two \\nnewspapers having a bona fide circulation in the Creek Nation.  \\n§ 42, 31 Stat. at 872. \\n \\n This provision evidences Congress\\'s clear understanding that in the wake of the Allotment Act the Nation would:  (1) retain legislative and executive \\nbranches of government, (2) which would continue to \\npass and approve acts, ordinances, and resolutions, (3) pertaining to a wide variety of issues, including (without limitation) tribal lands, moneys, and other property, and (4) applying to \"citizens\" (defined in \\nSection 1 of the Act as  Nation members) and \\n\"individuals.\"  The requirement that notice of new Nation laws be published \"in the Creek Nation,\" and the recognition that the Nation retained legislative jurisdiction over \"the lands … of individuals after \\nallotment,\" underscored that territorial borders \\nwould remain intact.  So too did Congress\\'s pledge in the following section that the United States would \"maintain strict laws in said nation … [regarding] \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n16 \\n \\n liquors or intoxicants,\" § 43, 31 Stat. at 872 (emphasis \\nadded).3 \\n \\nB. Surrounding History \\n \\n The history surrounding the Allotment Act amply confirms the plain import of its terms.  \\nPetitioner has detailed that  history, Petr. Br. 7-12; see \\nalso Creek  Murphy  Br. 8-10, and the Nation will not \\nduplicate that discussion here.  The critical point is this:  In its statutory charge to the Dawes Commission, Congress sought allotment of a portion \\nof the Reservation to the Creeks and cession of any \\nsurplus.  Act of Mar. 3, 1893, § 16, 27 Stat. 612, 645-46.  But the Creek steadfastly opposed this plan.  Having been forced to relinquish their eastern lands \\nand the western half of their Indian Territory domain, \\nthe Creek \"would not ... agree to cede any portion of their lands to the Government[.]\"  1894 Annual Report of the Comm\\'n to the Five Civilized Tribes, at \\n14.\\n4  Resisting the overwhelming power of the \\ngovernment was no mean feat, but so resolute were \\nthe Creek, see id. at 8, 14, that the United States \\nreceded on this point while securing allotment.

In Morris v. Hitchcock , 194 U.S. 384 (1904), the \\nChickasaw Nation, under a provision materially \\nidentical to Section 42, had enacted legislation \\n(enforced by the Secretary) regulating noncitizen activities within its reservation.  See id . at 391 and \\nn.1.  This Court affirmed the D.C. Circuit\\'s rejection \\nof a challenge to the law, stating that the Section 42-\\nlike provision was intended to permit the continued exercise of tribal legislative authority.  Id. at 393.  The \\ndecision favorably quoted a 1900 Opinion of Attorney General Griggs, id. at 392, which stated that \\npurchasers of tracts in the Five Tribes\\' reservations \\nremained subject to tribal jurisdiction \"within their \\nlimits.... even if the Indian title to the particular lots sold had been extinguished,\" 23 Op. Att\\'y Gen. 214, \\n216-17 (1900), 1900 WL 1001, at 2. \\n \\n5 http://bit.ly/MCN-1900-ARCFCT . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n18 \\n \\n  \\n The following year, in Buster v.

That authority \\n\"remained in full force and effect after ... the agreement of 1901\" and was not diminished by \"the establishment of town sites nor the purchase ... by noncitizens of lots therein[.].\"  Id. at 953-54. \\n \\n These conclusions followed because, while Congress had significantly curtailed the Nation\\'s powers (including abolishing  its courts), \"[t]he fact \\nremains nevertheless that every original attribute of \\nthe government of the Creek Nation still exists intact which has not been destroyed or limited by act of Congress[.]\"   Id. at 950.

      "{'III. Congress Deliberately Preserved the Creek Nation and Its Reservation in the Five Tribes Act': '. \\n  \\nA. Text \\n \\n On March 2, 1906, as the conditional dissolution of the Nation\\'s government approached, \\nsee supra note 3, Congress extended its life through a \\nJoint Resolution providing that  \"the tribal existence and present tribal governme nts [of the Five Tribes] … \\nare hereby continued in full force and effect … until all property of said trib es, or the proceeds thereof, \\nshall be distributed among the individual members of \\nsaid tribes,\" 34 Stat. 822, 822.  By its plain terms this was wind-down authority – it preserved the governments until allotment was complete. \\n \\n \\npower to tax \"nonmembers for the privilege of doing business \\nwithin the reservation.\"  Id. at 332-33.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n20 \\n \\n  But Congress went much further in the Five \\nTribes Act, 34 Stat. 137 (1906), enacted a few weeks later.  While various provisions contemplate ultimate \\ndissolution, in Section 28 Congress continued the \\ntribes\\' existence and their governments indefinitely:  \\n[T]he tribal existence and present tribal \\ngovernments of the [Five Tribes] are \\nhereby continued in full force and effect for all purposes authorized by law ….  Provided , That no act, ordinance, or \\nresolution … of the … legislature of any \\nof said tribes … shall be of any validity \\nuntil approved by the President[.]  \\n§ 28, 34 Stat. at 148.   \\nThe State has argued that this too was simply \\na wind-up provision.  But \"we are always reluctant to assume a statute is so worthless that Congress was up to – literally – nothing when it bothered to labor \\nthrough the grueling process of bicameralism and \\npresentment.\"  Fletcher v. United States , 730 F.3d \\n1206, 1210 (10th Cir. 2013) (Gorsuch, J.).  If completion of the allotment process was the concern, the Joint Resolution already had addressed it.  \\nSection 28 sweeps more broadly.  It echoes Section 42 \\nin confirming that the Creek government would continue to pass \"act[s ], ordinance[s], or \\nresolution[s],\" and further recognizes that the \\ngovernment could act for \"all purposes authorized by \\nlaw[.]\"  § 28, 34 Stat. at 148.  This language was enacted against the backdrop of the Nation\\'s legislative authority over \"th e lands of the tribe\" and \\n\"of individuals after allotment\" expressly recognized \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n21 \\n \\n in Section 42 and confirmed in Hitchcock and Buster .  \\nIndeed, the textual parallels between Sections 42 and 28 underscore that Congress had the former squarely \\nin mind when it enacted the latter.  See Tiger v. W. \\nInv. Co. , 221 U.S. 286, 303 (1911) (referencing the \\n\"right of legislation\" preserved by Section 28). \\n \\n No language in the Five Tribes Act purports to \\nalter Reservation boundaries.  Section 16 provides that after allotment, \"the residue of lands in each of said nations not reserved or otherwise disposed of \\nshall be sold by the Secretary,\" with the \\nindeterminate proceeds credited to the respective nation.  § 16, 34 Stat. at 143.  This provision simply opened up surplus land on the Reservation for settlement, with no fixed sum in return, and hence \\nfalls squarely within the category Parker deems \\nexemplary of reservation preservation, 136 S. Ct. at 1079; see supra at 12-13.  Section 19 increased from 5 \\nto 25 years the period of inalienability for allotments \\nheld by any fullblood tribal member.  § 19, 34 Stat. at \\n144; Tiger , 221 U.S. at 306.  And Section 27 provided \\nthat, in the event of tribal dissolution, tribal lands would \"not become public lands nor property of the United States, but shall be held in trust by the United \\nStates for the benefit of the Indians[.]\"  § 27, 34 Stat. \\nat 148.  Taken separately or together, these provisions do not remotely evidence \"the present and total surrender of all tribal interests\" in the Reservation, \\nParker , 136 S. Ct. at 1079 (quotation marks omitted). \\n  In Murphy , Oklahoma suggested that the \\nprovisions in the Act restricting the powers of the tribal governments, including the elimination of \\ntribal taxing (though not of other revenue-raising) \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n22 \\n \\n authority, connoted disestablishment.  § 11, 34 Stat. \\n141.  But the principle that there exists no \"roving license\" to extrapolate from the congressional \\nrestriction of certain tribal powers the wholesale \\ncurtailment of others, Bay Mills , 572 U.S. at 794;  see \\nalso Buster , 135 F. at 949-50, has especial force where \\nthe claimed result is disestablishment.  Congress can \\nand has \"enact[ed] legislation that both restricts and, \\nin turn, relaxes … restrictions on tribal sovereign authority,\" resulting in \"major changes in the metes and bounds of tribal sovereignty\" over time.  United \\nStates v. Lara , 541 U.S. 193, 202 (2004).  But the \\nquantum of power exercised by a tribe within its borders has never been conflated with the separate question whether those borders continue to exist.  For while Congress can restore aspects of tribal \\nsovereignty previously curtailed, id., a historic Indian \\nreservation is unique in that once disestablished, its restoration would encounter obstacles legal, practical, and political that would effectively render the \\ndisestablishment permanent.  This Court\\'s insistence \\nthat Congress\\'s intent be clear before it will hold that Congress took the final step of disestablishing a reservation, Parker, 136 S. Ct. at 1079,  is accordingly \\ncritical not only to the protection of tribal powers but \\nalso to the protection of Congress\\'s prerogatives to \\nadjust them.  Oklahoma\\'s effort to infer from the loss of some territorial authority an intent to eliminate all \\nof it violates this core principle. \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n23'}\n",
      "{'B. Surrounding History and Missouri Railway': 'The surrounding history again confirms the \\ntextual conclusion.  The United States agrees with the Nation and Petitioner that  Section 28 was added to \\nthe Five Tribes Act late in the legislative process in \\nsignificant part because Congress realized that \\nrestoration of the Five Tribes\\' reservations to the public domain would result in a massive transfer of lands to two railroad companies.  U.S. Murphy Br. 27; \\nPetr. Br. 11, 28-29; Creek Murphy  Br. 17-19 (detailing \\nlegislative history).  Congress had conditionally granted the companies (whose successor in interest remains a going concern) millions of acres within the reservations.  See Mo., Kan., & Tex. Ry. Co. v. United \\nStates , 235 U.S. 37, 38 (1914); 47 Ct. Cl. at 85-89 \\n(Howry, J., concurring).  The grants would vest \"whenever the Indian title shall be extinguished\" and \"said lands become a part of the public lands of the \\nUnited States.\"  § 9, 14 Stat. 236, 238 (1866); § 9, 14 \\nStat. 289, 291 (1866); Mo., Kan., & Tex. Ry. , 235 U.S. \\nat 39.   The grants, in other words, would vest upon \\ndisestablishment .  See Parker , 136 S. Ct. at 1079 \\n(disestablishment occurs by \"extinguish[ing] the land\\'s prior use ... as an Indian reservation – and ... return[ing] it to the United States\"); see also  id. at \\n1080 (\"to restore land to the public domain was to \\nextinguish the land\\'s prior use.\").  Congress focused squarely on this point in its deliberations over Section 28, and continued the Creek and other governments \\nwith the specific in tent of avoiding that result.  Petr. \\nBr. 11, 28-29; Creek Murphy Br. 17-19. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n24 \\n \\n  This prompted suit by one of the railroads.  The \\nsuit reached this Court, which in a unanimous opinion by Justice Holmes rejected the claim in a \\nholding in serious tension with the State\\'s arguments \\nhere:  \\nOn this literal reading of the [grant] the \\nconditions have not been fulfilled.  The \\nland has remained continuously appropriated to the use of the Indians, or has been sold for their benefit.  It \\nnever for a moment has become a part of \\nthe public domain in the ordinary \\nsense ....  [W]e cannot read [the grant] as \\npreventing the United States from making the change from tribal to \\nseveral possessions, or dealing with this \\nland in any way deemed most beneficial for those whose rights were treated as paramount.  The proviso that the land must become public land shows that a \\nmere change from tribal title was not \\nenough . \\n \\n235 U.S. at 40 (emphases added).  In reaching this \\nconclusion this Court cited both the Five Tribes Act \\nand the Creek Allotment Act as \"show[ing] in express \\nterms\" that the tribal lands had not been returned to the public domain and hence that the railroads\\' rights \\nhad not vested.  Id. at 41.  The opinion betrays no \\nunderstanding that these st atutes had instead been \\nthe capstones of a project to dismantle the Reservation.    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n25'}\n",
      "{'IV. Statehood Did Not Eradicate the Reservation Boundaries': '. \\n \\nA. Text \\n \\n Oklahoma has credited statehood as central to \\nthe inexorable march to disestablishment.  This \\nargument again runs headlong into text.  Just last \\nTerm, this Court reaffirmed that \"[t]reaty rights ... \\nare not impliedly terminated upon statehood.\"  Herrera v. Wyoming, 139 S. Ct. 1686, 1696 (2019) \\n(quoting Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa \\nIndians , 526 U.S. 172, 207 (1999)).  \"Statehood is \\nirrelevant ... unless a statehood Act otherwise demonstrates Congress\\' clea r intent to abrogate a \\ntreaty[.]\"  Id. \\n \\n  The Oklahoma Enabling Act evidences no such \\nintent.  Congress did not countenance the alteration of tribal boundaries in the Ac t.  Instead, the very first \\nsection of the Act provides: \\n \\nThat nothing contained in the [Oklahoma] constitution shall be construed  to limit or impair the rights \\nof person or property pertaining to the \\nIndians of said Territories (so long as such rights shall remain unextinguished) or to limit or affect the authority of the Government of the \\nUnited States to make any law or \\nregulation respecting such Indians, their lands, property, or other rights by treaties, agreement, law, or otherwise, \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n26 \\n \\n which it would have been competent to \\nmake if this Act had never been passed. \\n \\n§ 1, 34 Stat. 267, 267-68 (1906).  Oklahoma, moreover, \\nwas required to \"forever disc laim all right and title ... \\nto all lands ... owned or held by any Indian, tribe, or nation[.]\"  § 3, 34 Stat. at 270.  Far from using \\nstatehood as a vehicle to dismantle the Reservation, \\nthen, \"Congress was careful to preserve the authority of … the United States over the Indians, their lands and property, which it had prior to the passage of the [Enabling] act.\"  Tiger , 221 U.S. at 309. \\n \\nB. Surrounding History  \\n That Congress did not understand it to be necessary to abrogate the Reservation at statehood is \\nnot surprising.  As  Petitioner details, ample precedent \\nexisted for the admission of states with sizable reservations intact.  Indeed, not only was South Dakota admitted with forty-seven percent of its land \\nin reservation status, Petr. Br. 38, but the Cheyenne \\nRiver Sioux Reservation, confirmed by this Court in Solem , was set aside by Congress in March 1889, 25 \\nStat. 888, immediately on the eve of statehood in November of that year.   \\n \\n This understanding was on display again, just five days after enactment of the Oklahoma Enabling \\nAct, when Congress passed the Act of June 21, 1906, \\n34 Stat. 325.  There, Congress sought to resolve a \\nboundary dispute by \"declar[ing]\" an 1871 survey line mandated by the Treaty of 1866 \"to be the west \\nboundary line of the Creek Nation ,\" 34 Stat. at 364 \\n(emphasis added), and established a judicial \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n27 \\n \\n recording district with reference to the \"north line of \\nthe Creek Nation,\" id. at 343.  This would have been \\nstrange language for Cong ress to use had it just \\ndismantled the Creek Nation, especially given that in \\nthe same statute it made reference to \"what was formerly the north half of the Colville Indian Reservation,\" id. at 379.'}\n",
      "{\"C. The United States' Criminal Transfer Argument Lacks Textual Basis\": '. \\n \\n The United States (joined by the State) has \\nargued that various statutory provisions, including the criminal transfer provisions in the Enabling Act, conveyed criminal jurisdiction  over the Reservation to \\nthe State.  If that had happe ned, it would not by itself \\nhave been inconsistent with reservation status, and the Nation would accept Congress\\'s edict and move on.  But \"[t]he trouble is, nothing in the statute says anything like that.\"  SAS Inst., Inc. v. Iancu, 138 S. \\nCt. 1348, 1355 (2018).  Petitioner well explains why \\nnone of the provisions cited by the United States comes close to evidencing the clear intent necessary to transfer crimina l jurisdiction over Creek members \\nto the new State.  The Nation will not repeat that \\nanalysis, but wishes to emphasize two central points.     The United States argues that before statehood a series of territorial laws resulted in Indians and \\nnon-Indians being tried under the same laws in the \\nsame courts.  Any outcome, it posits, in which non-Indians and Indians would have been tried in different courts post-statehood would have altered the status quo and would have required legislation to \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n28 \\n \\n that effect.  But this ignores the fact that the courts \\nin which Indians and non-Indians were tried pre-statehood were federal (territorial) courts, and the \\nlaw applied was federal law.  That statehood would \\ntransfer non-Indians to state court jurisdiction was long-settled law.  United States v. McBratney, 104 \\nU.S. 621, 624 (1881).  But subjecting tribal members \\nto state jurisdiction would have marked a dramatic \\nchange in the status quo, one this Court has countenanced only where Congress \"has expressly provided that State laws shall apply,\" Washington v. \\nConfederated Bands and Tribes of Yakima Indian \\nNation , 439 U.S. 463, 470-71 (1979) (quotation marks \\nomitted).  The Enabling Act did nothing of the sort.   The lack of regard for text manifests itself in an \\neven more fundamental way.  In  Murphy, the State \\nand the United States urged this Court to disestablish the Reservation even if it agreed with their reading of the Enabling Act\\'s jurisdictional transfer provisions.  Okla. Murphy Suppl. Br. 8; U.S. Murphy Suppl. Br. \\n18 n.5.  But if those provis ions truly operate as they \\nsay, there would be no warrant for going beyond them to address disestablishment in this case.  Congress would have transferred criminal authority over the \\nCreek Reservation to the State, as it has done with \\nrespect to other reservations, see, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § \\n1162; 25 U.S.C. § 232, and whether the Reservation has retained its status would properly be a question \\nfor another day.  Only because text is ultimately \\nincidental to their arguments can the State and the United States claim otherwise.  \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n29 \\n \\n  I t  i s  n o t  s u r p r i s i n g  t h a t  a t  o r a l  a r g u m e n t  i n  \\nMurphy the State could not identify the date (that is, \\nthe statutory enactment) when disestablishment \\noccurred.  Murphy  Arg. Tr. 5-6.  One does not exist.  \\nAs the Tenth Circuit recognized three decades ago:  \\nAlthough Congress at one time may have \\nenvisioned the termination of the Creek \\nNation and complete divestiture of its territorial sovereignty, the legislation enacted in 1906 reveals that Congress decided not to implement that goal, and \\ninstead explicitly perpetuated the Creek \\nNation and recognized its continuing legislative authority….   It is not for the \\ncourts to complete a task that Congress \\nchose not to finish. \\n \\nIndian Country , 829 F.2d at 981.'}\n",
      "{\"V.

(quotation marks omitted). \\n \\n These principles apply with even greater force \\nhere.  Contrary to facts at play in Parker , the Nation \\nand its members have maintained a significant and continuous presence throughout the Reservation ever \\nsince statehood, and the Nation exercises substantial \\ngovernmental authority for the benefit of all Reservation residents.

Not \\nsurprisingly, the Creek government\\'s efforts focused \\non turning back that assault wherever possible, even \\nas the Interior Department frequently turned a blind \\neye, or worse yet, joined in the plunder.

      "{'B. Present-Day Governance and Demographic Presence': 'Today, there is no gainsaying that the Nation \\nand its citizens maintain a robust presence across the Reservation.  The Nation is the fourth most populous Indian nation in the United States, with 89,271 \\ncitizens.\\n14  Nation members live throughout the \\nReservation.15  Under the Nation\\'s Constitution, the \\nReservation is divided into eight legislative districts, each of which serves as a home voting district for Nation citizens and sends two representatives to the \\nNational Council.  MCN Const. art. IV, § 9; art. VI, §§ \\n1-2.\\n16 \\n  The Constitution main tains the tripartite, \\nseparation-of-powers governme nt first established in \\n1867, with a democratically elected Principal Chief, \\nSecond Chief, and National Council, and a judiciary appointed by the executive branch and confirmed by the legislature.  Id. arts. IV-VII.  The Constitution, \\nwhich was approved by the Interior Department in \\n1979, provides that \"[t]he political jurisdiction of the [Nation] shall be as it geographically appeared in 1900 which is based upon those Treaties entered into by the [Nation] and the United States[.]\"  Id. art. I,     \\n§ 2.

The Nation \\nis party to an Intergovernmental Cross-Deputization Agreement with the United St ates and virtually all of \\nthe counties and munici palities within the \\nReservation, including both the City and County of \\nTulsa.\\n18  Pursuant to the agr eement, the Lighthorse \\nrespond to criminal and emergency situations throughout the Reservation, regardless of the Indian or non-Indian status of those involved, and regardless of the fee or trust status  of the lands where the \\nincidents arise.  Given the sophistication of both its \\nregular and specialized units, the Lighthorse are frequently called on to a ssist other law enforcement \\nagencies, including in the more rural areas of the \\nReservation; that cooperation has yielded notable \\nsuccesses and numerous accolades for the Department.\\n19  A vivid example occurred just days \\nbefore the filing of this brief, when the Lighthorse received a request from the Okfuskee County Sheriff\\'s \\nOffice and the Oklahoma State Bureau of \\nInvestigations to search for the suspect in a double homicide and arson.  Ten Lighthorse officers, including members of its investigations and K-9 \\n \\n18  See http://bit.ly/MCN-Lighthorse . \\n19 See, e.g. , http://bit.ly/lighthorse-police ; http://bit.ly/Lighthorse-\\nNegotiation ; http://bit.ly/inmate-capture .

The suspect is non-Indian, and the crime, search, and \\narrest all took place on fee land.\\n20 \\n  The Nation also coordinates with local governments on vital infrastructure.  They work \\ntogether to establish in frastructure priorities, \\nallocate project responsibilities, and fund construction and maintenance throughout the Reservation.\\n21  Much of the focus is on roads and \\nbridges sorely in need of repair or replacement.  State \\nand county officials frequently credit this partnership \\nof \"government entities working hand-in-hand together to provide a benefit to the citizens here.\"\\n22  \\nFederal officials likewise recognize the value of the Nation\\'s efforts, with the Chief of the Bureau of \\nIndian Affairs Division of Transportation \\nunderscoring that the Nation\\'s \"bridge rehabilitation and reconstruction projects  … will improve access to \\nreliable, safe, and affordable transportation for all \\nrural Oklahomans[.]\"\\n23 \\n  The Nation\\'s government al activities enhance \\nthe quality of life for Reservation residents in myriad other ways.  In 2019, the he alth-care system operated \\nby the Nation\\'s Department of Health provided a full \\narray of medical services for more than 180,000 patient visits at its three state-of-the-art hospitals (all \\n \\n20 http://bit.ly/MCN-Lighthorse-Arrest-Feb-6-2020 .   \\n21 See, e.g. , http://bit.ly/MCN-Transpor tation-Agreement-Lamar-\\nRoad ; http://bit.ly/MCN-DOT-Meeting ; http://bit.ly/MCN-\\nTransportation-Agreements .    \\n22 http://bit.ly/MCN-Transportation-Project-Mission-Road .    \\n23 http://bit.ly/MCN-Transportation-BIA-Letter-of-Support .    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n39 \\n \\n in rural areas and servin g both Indians and non-\\nIndians) and six medical clinics,24 with the Nation \\nhaving invested more than $85 million in these \\nfacilities in recent years.25  The Nation\\'s Family \\nViolence Prevention Program (\"FVPP\") provides significant assistance to victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking.\\n26  The FVPP (widely \\nrecognized by police departments, state court judges, \\nthe U.S. Department of Justice, and others for the quality and importance of its efforts)\\n27 serves Indian \\nand non-Indian clients alike, and in many areas of the Reservation is the only agency to provide such \\nservices.\\n28  The Nation also makes vital contributions \\nto education on the Reservat ion, operating Head Start \\nand WIC programs (again for Indians and non-Indians alike)\\n29 and partnering through its \\nDepartment of Education with local school districts \\nand the Oklahoma Department of Education to \\nimprove educational outcomes for all students.30 \\n  The Reservation-wide presence of the Nation\\'s \\ngovernment evidences itself in ways going beyond the \\nimportant programs it offers.  \"The territorial jurisdiction of the Muscogee Courts ... extend[s] to all \\n \\n24 http://bit.ly/MCN-Dept-of-Health  (\"Hospitals\" and \"Clinics\"); \\nhttp://bit.ly/MCN-First-Quarter-Report-2020 , at 6-7. \\n25 http://bit.ly/MCN-Construction-Projects-Report ; \\nhttp://bit.ly/CreekNation-ER-Expansion . \\n26 http://bit.ly/family-violence-prevention .  \\n27 See http://bit.ly/MCN-FVPP-Letters-of-Support ; Creek \\nMurphy Br. 28-29.  \\n28 http://bit.ly/MCN-FVPP-Clients ; http://bit.ly/FVPP-Map .   \\n29 http://bit.ly/MCN-Head-Start ; http://www.mcn-\\nnsn.gov/services/wic/ .   \\n30 http://bit.ly/MCN-First-Quarter-Report-2020 , at 11-13; \\nhttp://bit.ly/MCN-Education-Collaborative-Workshop . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n40 \\n \\n the territory defined in the 1866 Treaty with the \\nUnited States,\" MCN Code tit. 27, § 1-102(a),31 and \\nthe Nation\\'s courts accordingly exercise jurisdiction \\nover causes of action invo lving tribal members that \\narise within the Reservation\\'s boundaries, including on fee lands, see Walker v.

      "{\"VI. The State's Exaggerated Arguments About Consequences Provide No Support for Disestablishment\": '. \\n \\n In Murphy , the State and its amici, including \\nthe United States, suggested a host of consequences that would follow if this Court were to allow the \\nReservation to remain in place.  These suggestions \\nshare three things in common: (1) they are addressed to the wrong branch of government; (2) they are \\noverstated, and overlook entirely the significant intergovernmental cooperation already in place; and \\n(3) they fail to account for the disruption in \\ngovernance that would result if the Reservation were disestablished.'}\n",
      "{'A. Criminal Consequences': 'In Murphy , the Nation suggested that in the \\nevent of an affirmance, it would continue to explore with the United States, the State, and Congress the \\noptimal allocation of crimi nal jurisdiction on the \\nReservation.  The United States seized on this as an \"effective[] acknowledg[ment] … that affirmance would constitute a sea change[.]\"  U.S. Murphy  Suppl. \\nBr. 7.  Not so.  The Nation has no hesitation in \\nreiterating what it said previously:  It has a paramount interest in maintaining law and order within its Reservation, and firmly believes that, if there are adjustments to be made to criminal \\njurisdiction, then Congress is the constitutionally \\nempowered body to do so.  \"[I]n our constitutional order the job of writing new laws belongs to Congress, not the courts.\"  Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC , 138 S. Ct. \\n1386, 1413 (2018) (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  Ample \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n42 \\n \\n precedent exists for congressional action in this area.  \\nU.S. Att\\'ys Murphy Br. 6-9; Creek Murphy  Suppl. Br. \\n8-10. \\n \\n The United States and Oklahoma argued that \\neven if criminal jurisdictional issues are addressed in a satisfactory manner going forward, affirming the \\nNation\\'s reservation status would \"open the \\nfloodgates to countless attack s on convictions,\" Okla. \\nMurphy  Suppl. Reply Br. 8.  But federal habeas \\npetitions must be filed within one year, 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d), with strict limitations on second or \\nsuccessive petitions, id. § 2244(b).  The Tenth Circuit \\nhas already determined that Murphy provides no \\nbasis for overcoming these limitations.  See Dopp v. \\nMartin , 750 F. App\\'x 754, 757 (10th Cir. 2018); Boyd \\nv. Martin , 747 F. App\\'x 712, 716-17 (10th Cir. 2018).  \\n  Petitioner, who has a clear self-interest in making the argument, and Oklahoma, which has \\nperhaps a short-sighted one, contend that there are \\nno analogous barriers in the State system.  Petr. Br. 43 & n.5; Okla. Murphy  Suppl. Reply Br. 7; see also  \\nWackerly v. State , 237 P.3d 795, 797 (Okla. Crim. App. \\n2010).  But in an unpublished opinion the State Court \\nof Criminal Appeals has already found at least one Murphy  claim \"waived and procedurally barred.\"  \\nJohnson v. Oklahoma , No. PC-2018-343 (Okla. Crim. \\nApp. July 24, 2018).  And while Petitioner\\'s case is of \\ncourse before this Court, the decision below can fairly be described as a judicial curiosity:  Rather than holding Petitioner\\'s claim, it denied it on the grounds that this Court had not yet decided Murphy , and in \\ndoing so did not squarely address procedural bars.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n43 \\n \\n The Oklahoma courts plainly have unfinished \\nbusiness in this area.  \\n Moreover, if any State prisoners ultimately \\nsucceed in challenging their convictions, they would be subject to re-prosecution by the United States, see \\nUnited States v. Magnan , 863 F.3d 1284, 1291 (10th \\nCir. 2017), and the Nation.  The Nation understands \\nthat various factors will come  into play in making re-\\nprosecution decisions, but surely the existence of such factors does not suffice to disestablish a Reservation over a century after Congress made a concerted \\ndecision not to do so.'}\n",
      "{'B. Civil Consequences': 'Claims of significan t disruption from the \\nvindication of the Reservation\\'s boundaries cannot be sustained in light of on-the-ground reality and this Court\\'s precedents.  \"[M]illions of acres … [of] non-Indian fee land,\" Atkinson Trading Co. v. Shirley, 532 \\nU.S. 645, 648 (2001), exist within reservations across \\nthe country.  As NCAI well explains, these include sizeable portions of largely non-Indian cities like Tacoma, Washington that have thrived with the \\naffirmation of reservation status and the \\nopportunities for economic development that it brings.  NCAI Br. 25-29.   This Court\\'s precedents render hollow any \\nclaims of civil legal disrup tion as they presumptively \\nconstrain the exercise of tribal authority over non-Indians on fee lands (in areas ranging from regulation to taxation to adjudication ) while providing that the \\ncorollary state authority remains intact.  Id. 26; Creek \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n44 \\n \\n Murphy Br. 31-36.  Even with respect to on-\\nreservation tribal members, Oklahoma retains considerable power, including the authority to levy \\nproperty taxes on fee land.  Id. 35-36.  An Oklahoma-\\nspecific tribal statute (of which there are many) precludes any argument that the Nation could usurp state environmental regulation on the Reservation.  \\nPub. L. No. 109-59, § 10211(a)-(b), 119 Stat. 1144, \\n1937 (2005).  And claims of disruption appear particularly misplaced given the extensive intergovernmental cooperation between the State and tribes in eastern Oklahoma, Boren et al. Murphy  Br., \\nincluding the Nation in particular.  See supra at 37-\\n39.   With so little to aim at, Oklahoma trained \\nconsiderable rhetorical fire in Murphy on the Indian \\nChild Welfare Act of 1978, 25 U.S.C. §§ 1901 et seq. , \\nclaiming that child custody determinations would be undone in the event of an affirmance.  Okla. Murphy  \\nBr. 56.  This was unfortunate.  A far better indicator \\nregarding State-Nation cooperation under ICWA \\ncomes in a brief filed recently by Oklahoma and twenty-five other states in support of the Act\\'s constitutionality.  That brief emphasizes that \"ICWA \\ncreates an important framework that has allowed \\nrobust state-tribal collaboration in improving the health and welfare of Indian children.  Amici States have employed ICWA as a means of strengthening \\nand deepening their important, government-to-\\ngovernment relationships with  tribes in this critical \\narea.\"\\n33 \\n \\n \\n33 http://bit.ly/MCN-States-Amicus-Brief-ICWA , at 25.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n45 \\n \\n  This captures the situation well.  Oklahoma, \\nthe Nation, and local agencies and courts enjoy a highly successful partnership on child custody.  \\nUnder ICWA and its state counterpart, 25 U.S.C. §§ \\n1911(c), 1912(a); Okla. Stat. tit. 10, § 40.4, the Nation intervenes in every custody proceeding involving a Creek child, and those proceedings already \"utilize to \\nthe maximum extent possible\" Nation services in \\nsecuring appropriate placements, id. § 40.6. \\n  The Nation is committed to preserving current placements, and ready options exist for it to do so.  As \\nthe States\\' ICWA brief notes,  the State and Nation \\ncan compact to allocate jurisdiction over custody proceedings,\\n34 and any such compact could recognize \\ncontinuing state court authority over existing placements.  See 25 U.S.C. § 1919(a); Okla. Stat. tit. \\n10, § 40.7.  The Nation can also establish enforceable \\nplacement preferences, including provisions conferring presumptive validity on existing placements under Nation law.  25 U.S.C. § 1915(c).  \\nThe Nation and the State share the same goals on this \\nissue, and overheated litigation rhetoric will not prevent their realization.'}\n",
      "{'C. The State Ignores the Detrimental Effects that Disestablishment Would Have on Reservation Governance': '. \\n \\n As detailed above, the Nation engages in \\nsubstantial governmental activities for the benefit of Indians and non-Indians alike on the Reservation and \\n \\n34 http://bit.ly/MCN-States-Amicus-Brief-ICWA , at 25-26.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n46 \\n \\n does so in close cooperation with neighboring \\ngovernments.  A disestablishment holding would interfere significantly with these activities, because it \\nwould undermine the sense of shared jurisdiction that \\nunderpins the cooperation.  Under existing intergovernmental agreements, for example, the Nation\\'s Lighthorse Police participate in and make \\nsignificant contributions to police operations that \\nresult in the arrests of non-Indians on fee land within the Reservation; the Nation\\'s Transportation Department collaborates in the prioritization, planning, and execution of infrastructure projects on \\ncounty roads and bridges whose repair is essential to \\nthe safety of thousands of Reservation residents; and the Nation\\'s FVPP staff arrive in the middle of the night to help address grav e situations of family \\nviolence or sexual abuse in volving non-Indians on fee \\nland.  Loss of access to these services would follow \\ndisestablishment.  It would not be possible for officials of the State or its political subdivisions to share authority with respect to th eir constituents in this \\nmanner absent an understanding of overlapping \\njurisdiction.   And this is not simply speculative.  While cooperative law enforcement agreements commenced \\nin 2000, fourteen were executed after the Tenth \\nCircuit\\'s decision in Murphy ,\\n35 their consummation \\nbolstered by the understanding of shared jurisdiction the decision confirmed.  Similarly, individuals and entities ranging from a Sheriff to state court judges to \\nthe Okmulgee Police Department have praised the \\nFVPP\\'s work because it embodies \"a holistic and \\n \\n35 See http://bit.ly/MCN-Lighthorse . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n47 \\n \\n collaborative approach in rural communities across \\nthe eleven counties that comprise the jurisdictional boundaries of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation.\"\\n36  \\nRecently, the Lighthorse Police took over the patrol \\noperations in the City of Mannford for an entire day to enable all police officers there to attend the funeral of their slain chief.\\n37  That sort of thing simply does \\nnot happen absent an understanding of the Nation\\'s \\nauthority.  \\nIn DeCoteau, this Court stated that \"competing \\npleas [regarding practical consequences] are not for \\nus to adjudge,\" 420 U.S. at 449, a conclusion this \\nCourt reiterated in Parker.  Text governs the proper \\nresolution of this case, but if consequences are to be considered, they militate in favor of affirmation of the \\nNation\\'s Reservation, not its disestablishment.'}\n"

      "(quotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, the analysis \n",
      "hinges on statutory text.  \"As with any other question \n",
      "of statutory interpretation, we begin with the text, ... the most probative evidence of diminishment.\"  Id. at \n",

By mobilizing \\ncurrently and formerly incarcerated people and their \\nfamilies who have been adversely affected by unjust \\nsentences, FAMM illuminates the human face of sen-tencing as it advocates fo r state and federal sentenc-\\ning reform.  FAMM advances its charitable purposes \\nin part through education of the general public and \\nthrough selected amicus  filings in important cases.   \\nThe interpretation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1) and the \\napplication of the principl es that govern all manda-\\ntory minimum sentencing statutes are of paramount \\nimportance to FAMM.  The court of appeals and  \\nthe government have adopted an interpretation of § 924(e)(1) that treats prior offenses as having been \\n“committed on occasions different from one another” \\nif there is any separation in time – even just a few \\nmoments – between those offenses.  That interpreta-\\ntion has led in many cases,  including this one, to \\nmandatory 15-year prison terms for so-called career \\ncriminals where offenses making up the criminal  \\n                                                 \\n1 Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.6, counsel for amicus  \\nrepresent that they authored this brief in its entirety and that \\nnone of the parties or their counsel, nor any other person  \\nor entity other than amicus or its counsel, made a monetary \\ncontribution intended to fund the preparation or submission  \\no f  t h i s  b r i e f .

As FAMM’s \\nmembers are keenly aware, in terpretation of language \\nthat triggers a mandatory minimum sentence often \\nmatters more to individual defendants’ lives and lib-\\nerty than interpretation of the elements for offenses \\nsentenced through the exercise of judicial discretion.  \\nWhere, as here, the government advances an expan-\\nsive interpretation of a mandatory minimum that \\nwould impose arbitrary, harsh sentences in a way lacking foundation in any legislative judgment, \\nFAMM has a strong interest in advocating for rigor-\\nous judicial scrutiny. \\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY \\nI. The rule of lenity has an important role to  \\nplay in the interpretation of mandatory minimum sentencing statutes and shou ld be given special force \\nin cases that involve them.  Mandatory minimum \\nsentencing statutes pose special threats to individual liberty and the separation of powers.  Experience \\nteaches that such statut e s  l e a d  t o  s e v e r e  a n d  \\ndisproportionate sentences, reallocate power from \\nlegislators and judges to prosecutors, and often \\nultimately fail to achieve their ostensible goal of \\nsentencing uniformity.  Experience also teaches that \\nsuch statutes are poorly drafted and difficult to \\napply.  Because the costs of overreading harsh \\nsentencing statutes are high , lenity counsels in favor \\nof narrower reading. \\n 3 \\nA. The most obvious cost of error in overreading a  \\nmandatory minimum sentencing statute is the lost liberty of individuals who receive a far longer prison term than the legislature actually intended.  Lenity \\nembodies the courts’ “instinctive distaste[] against \\nmen languishing in prison unless the lawmaker has \\nclearly said they should.”  Henry J. Friendly, “Mr. \\nJustice Frankfurter and the Reading of Statutes,” in \\nBenchmarks  196, 209 (1967).  A mandatory 15-year \\nsentence based on less-than-certain evidence of \\nlegislative intent is indeed distasteful.  Mandatory \\nminimum statutes like the one here also reflect moral condemnation for a special subgroup of criminals – as \\nshown by Congress’s decision to pass an “Armed \\nCareer Criminal Act” (“ACCA”) – that should follow \\nonly from a genuine legislative decision. \\nMandatory minimum sentencing statutes also \\nimpair courts’ efforts to achieve the important goals \\nof fairness and proportionate punishment.  Although Congress has the power (within constitutional \\nbounds) to sacrifice fairness and proportionality to a \\nperceived greater good, courts should not conclude \\nthat Congress has done so based on guesswork or \\nspeculation about the meaning of an unclear statute.  \\nOften, mandatory minimum sentencing statutes fail \\nto achieve the goal of sentencing uniformity because they place great power in the hands of prosecutors, \\nthus inviting inconsistent and arbitrary application.  \\nApplying the rule of lenity rigorously to such statutes \\nlessens those costs to the system and ensures that \\nthey are imposed only when Congress has truly \\nfound them justified. \\nBy contrast, erring on the side of narrow \\nconstructions for mandatory minimum statutes is \\nless risky.  Most importantly, judges always retain \\npower to sentence up to the statutory maximum or to \\n 4 \\nrun sentences for multiple offenses consecutively.  \\nThey do not need mandatory minimums to determine \\nappropriate sentences based on the nature of an \\noffense or the history and characteristics of an \\noffender.  Moreover, the go vernment is well situated \\nto press for new legislation if dissatisfied with the \\ncourts’ interpretation.  There is no reason to doubt \\nthat prosecutors will call for stronger criminal penalties in response to any true threat to public \\nsafety or that legislators will fail to answer such calls. \\nB. The risk of error is particularly acute when \\ncourts interpret mandatory minimum sentencing statutes.  As this Court knows all too well, Congress \\noften writes such statutes in a confusing way.  The \\nstatutory provision here resulted from a rare \\nconfession of error by the Solicitor General that, in \\nessence, Congress had left needed language out of a 15-year sentencing statute and so had inflicted a \\nharsher and broader penalty than anyone involved  \\nin the statute’s creation (the Justice Department \\nincluded) had anticipated.  This Court’s recent cases \\nhave invalidated other parts of § 924 as unconsti-\\ntutionally vague, and over the years the Court has \\nremarked on similar problems with other mandatory minimum sentencing statutes.  When Congress \\nenacts mandatory minimum sentencing statutes  \\nwith enormous effects on future defendants, but \\ngives little consideration to statutory details, the rule \\nof lenity provides a much-needed safeguard for \\nindividual liberty. \\nII. The rule of lenity confirms that this Court \\nshould reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.  \\nPetitioner Wooden correctly argues that 18 U.S.C. \\n§ 924(e) should be read in his favor even without the \\nrule of lenity.  If any doubt remains, lenity should \\ndispose of it.  That conclusion is further supported  \\n 5 \\nby examining judicial experience with cases under \\n§ 924(e)(1).  The standard endorsed by the court of \\nappeals – under which even a moment’s separation \\nbetween two prior offenses qualifies them as \\noccurring on different occasions – has led to \\ninconsistent results, arbitrary distinctions, and \\nrepeated judicial observations about confusion and \\nuncertainty in the statutory scheme. \\nA. One recurring type of situation involves \\nburglaries of related or adjacent structures or dwellings.  Examples include the mini-warehouses at \\nissue here; a group of adjacent storage units at the same street address in United States v. Carr , 592 \\nF.3d 636 (4th Cir. 2010); and three businesses in a \\nsingle strip mall in United States v. Hudspeth , 42 \\nF.3d 1015 (7th Cir. 1994) (en banc), abrogated on \\nother grounds by Shepard v. United States , 544 U.S. \\n13 (2005).  Whether assessed against the constitu-tional right to fair warnin g or the legislature’s sole \\nresponsibility under the Constitution to define \\ncrimes, the statute does no t clearly classify several \\nbreak-ins in the course of a day or an hour as prior \\noffenses on “occasions different from one another.”  \\nAccordingly, the statute should not be construed to \\nmandate 15 years in prison by treating such offenses \\nas separate violent felonies.  \\nB. Another situation that repeatedly arises under \\n§ 924(e) is an offense co mmitted while the defendant \\nevades or resists arrest for another offense.  \\nExamples include pushing a police officer after \\ncommitting a robbery, United States v. Schieman , \\n894 F.2d 909 (7th Cir. 1990); fleeing a police officer \\nafter a traffic stop that interrupted a domestic \\nassault, United States v. Davidson , 527 F.3d 703  \\n(8th Cir. 2008), vacated in part on other grounds ,  \\n551 F.3d 807 (8th Cir. 2008) (per curiam); and \\n 6 \\ncommitting two assaults in the course of a single \\nhigh-speed chase, Levering v. United States , 890 F.3d \\n738 (8th Cir. 2018).  The decisions applying § 924(e) to these situations acknowledge confusion and \\njudicial disagreement, with some courts ruling that any separation of time between the onset of two \\noffenses supports a finding that they occurred on different occasions.  No such rule can be clearly \\nderived from the present statute using ordinary rules \\nof statutory construction.  The courts of appeals should instead have followed the tradition of lenity to \\nanswer the difficult questions posed by this statute. \\nARGUMENT \\nI. THE RULE OF LENITY SHOULD BE \\nAPPLIED RIGOROUSLY TO MANDATORY \\nMINIMUM SENTENCING STATUTES \\n“[T]he rule of lenity[] teach[es] that ambiguities \\nabout the breadth of a cri minal statute should be \\nresolved in the defendant’s favor.”  United States v. \\nDavis , 139 S. Ct. 2319, 2333 ( 2019).  That rule has \\nfamously been described as “‘perhaps not much less old than’ the task of statut ory ‘construction itself.’”  \\nId. (quoting United States v. Wiltberger , 18 U.S.  \\n(5 Wheat.) 76, 95 (1820) (Marshall, C.J.)).   \\nAt its core the rule of le nity is an understanding \\nthat “a fair warning should be given to the world in \\nlanguage that the common world will understand,  \\nof what the law intends to  do if a certain line is \\npassed,” and that, “[t]o make  the warning fair, so far \\nas possible the line sh ould be clear.”  McBoyle v. \\nUnited States , 283 U.S. 25, 27 (1931) (Holmes, J.).  In \\naddition, judicial adherence to the rule of lenity also “places the weight of inertia upon the party” – that \\nis, the executive branch – “that can best induce \\nCongress to speak more clearly and keeps courts \\n 7 \\nfrom making criminal law in Congress’s stead.”  \\nUnited States v. Santos , 553 U.S. 507, 514 (2008) \\n(plurality); see Bell v. United States , 349 U.S. 81, 83 \\n(1955) (Frankfurter, J.) (“ When Congress leaves to \\nthe Judiciary the task of imputing to Congress an \\nundeclared will, the ambiguity should be resolved in \\nfavor of lenity.”). \\nIn several cases involving mandatory minimum \\nsentencing provisions, the Court has recognized and \\napplied the “presupposition . . . [that] doubts in the enforcement of a penal code” should be “resolve[d] . . . \\nagainst the imposition of a harsher punishment.”  Bell, 349 U.S. at 83.  Examples include Davis , which \\ninvoked lenity to reject a broader saving construction of a different provision of the same mandatory mini-\\nmum statute at issue here, see 139 S. Ct. at 2333; \\nBurrage v. United States , 571 U.S. 204 (2014), which \\ndescribed a 15-year mandat ory minimum statute as \\n“a criminal statute subject to the rule of lenity,” and \\nlenity as a reason the Court “[e]specially” could not \\ndepart from the “ordinary,  accepted meaning” of  \\n“the [statutory] text,” id. at 216; and United States  \\nv. Granderson , 511 U.S. 39 (1994), which “appl[ied] \\nthe rule of lenity” to “resolve [an] ambiguity” in a “mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment” \\nafter revocation of probation, id. at 56-57.  Those \\ndecisions cohere with others explaining that the rule of lenity assists “not only to resolve issues about the \\nsubstantive scope of criminal statutes, but to answer questions about the severity of sentencing.”  United \\nStates v. R.L.C. , 503 U.S. 291, 306 (1992) (plurality) \\n(citing Bifulco v. United States , 447 U.S. 381, 387 \\n(1980) (collecting cases)). \\nIndeed, especially good reasons warrant applying \\nthe rule of lenity rigorously to statutes that, like the \\nACCA, create aggravated offenses with mandatory \\n 8 \\nminimum sentences.  A broad construction bars \\njudges from tailoring the sentence to the offense and \\nthe offender, leading to particularly harsh conse-\\nquences that only Congress can correct.  A narrower \\nconstruction, by contrast, does not prevent judges \\nfrom imposing longer sentences where necessary.  \\n“These interpretive asymmetries give the rule of \\nlenity special force in the context of mandatory \\nminimum provisions.”  Dean v. United States , 556 \\nU.S. 568, 585 (2009) (Breyer, J., dissenting). \\nFurther, experience shows that mandatory mini-\\nmum statutes frequently present difficult problems \\nof statutory construction, creating a heightened risk \\nthat courts will read them to impose sentences that \\nCongress never intended.  Wh ere, as here, an unclear \\nstatute presents a palpable risk of error, courts \\nproperly refuse to “condemn a man to a minimum of \\n15 years in prison on the basis of . . . speculation,” \\nBegay v. United States , 553 U.S. 137, 154 (2008) \\n(Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment), about what \\nCongress meant to say. \\nA. The Rule of Lenity Helps Avoid the  \\nParticularly High Costs of Reading  \\nMandatory Minimums Too Broadly  \\n1. The costs of erroneously construing mandatory \\nminimum sentencing provisions too broadly are especially high, and the costs of construing them too \\nnarrowly are especially low.  The greatest cost of \\nreading a mandatory minimu m too broadly is that \\nindividual defendants lose  their liberty.  Mandatory \\nminimum provisions are, by design, severe.  They \\noften tie an additional prison sentence of years or \\ndecades (here, a decade and a half) to a single factual \\ndetermination.  Such provisions therefore speak to \\nthe core concern that has motivated courts to apply \\nthe rule of lenity for centuries:  the “instinctive \\n 9 \\ndistaste[] against men lang uishing in prison unless \\nthe lawmaker has clearly sa id they should.”  Henry \\nJ. Friendly, “Mr. Justice Frankfurter and the Reading of Statutes,” in Benchmarks  196, 209 (1967), \\nquoted in United States v. Bass , 404 U.S. 336, 348 \\n(1971).  Because of that concern, this Court “will not \\ninterpret a federal criminal statute so as to increase \\nthe penalty that it places on an individual when such \\nan interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what Congress intended.”  Ladner v. \\nUnited States , 358 U.S. 169, 178 (1958). \\nFurther, mandatory minimum provisions often are \\nsaid to reflect (at least in theory) the moral judgment \\nof the community that particular conduct deserves \\nharsher punishment.  In our system of government, \\nthat judgment is reserved to the legislature.  The \\nrule of lenity ensures that criminal sentences \\nactually reflect legislative judgment, rather than \\nguesswork by the courts abo ut what the legislature \\nmeant.  See Granderson , 511 U.S. at 69 (Kennedy, J., \\nconcurring in the judgment) (“‘[B]ecause criminal punishment usually represents the moral condemna-\\ntion of the community, legislatures and not courts \\nshould define criminal activity,’ and set the punish-\\nments therefor.”) (quoting Bass , 404 U.S. at 348) \\n(citation omitted); R.L.C. , 503 U.S. at 309 (Scalia, J., \\nconcurring in part and co ncurring in the judgment) \\n(describing one of “the rule of lenity’s . . . purpose[s]” \\nas “assuring that the society, through its represen-\\ntatives, has genuinely called for the punishment to \\nbe meted out”); Wiltberger , 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) at 95 \\n(explaining that “[t]he rule that penal laws are to  be construed strictly” is  founded not merely on \\n“tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals” \\nbut also on the “plain principle that the power of \\n 10 \\npunishment is vested in the legislative, not in the \\njudicial department”). \\nAny criminal statute presents these concerns,  \\nbut mandatory minimum provisions make them \\nparticularly weighty.  Unlike other criminal laws, \\nmandatory minimums are exceptions to the principle \\nthat courts should “impose a sentence sufficient,  \\nbut not greater than necessary,” to accomplish the goals of criminal punishme nt after considering  \\n“the nature and circumstances of the offense and  \\nthe history and characteristics of the defendant.”   \\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1).  A mandatory minimum is a \\ncongressional directive to subordinate justice in \\nindividual cases to a perceived need for greater \\ndeterrence or incapacitation generally.  Congress may choose to make that tradeoff (within constitu-\\ntional bounds), but the courts should ensure that \\nCongress has actually made that choice before \\nimposing needlessly harsh punishments.  Cf. Busic  \\nv. United States , 446 U.S. 398, 408-09 (1980) \\n(interpreting a sentencing enhancement; rejecting the “assumption that . . . Congress’ sole objective  \\nwas to increase the penalties . . . to the maximum \\nextent possible”). \\n2. The adverse consequences of erroneously \\nexpanding mandatory sentencing beyond the limits of congressional intent affect more than just \\nindividual defendants.  Such errors strike at the \\nfoundations of the sentencing system by under-\\nmining “sentencing proportionality – a key element of sentencing fairness.”  Harris v. United States , 536 \\nU.S. 545, 570-71 (2002) (Breye r, J., concurring in \\npart and concurring in the judgment), overruled by \\nAlleyne v. United States , 570 U.S. 99 (2013).  As the \\nSentencing Commission – quoted with approval by this Court – has explained:  “‘The “cliffs” that result \\n 11 \\nfrom mandatory minimums compromise proportion-\\nality, a fundamental prem ise for just punishment, \\nand a primary goal of the Sentencing Reform Act.’”  Neal v. United States , 516 U.S. 284, 291-92 (1996) \\n(quoting United States Sentencing Comm’n, Special \\nReport to the Congress:  Mandatory Minimum \\nPenalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System  iii \\n(Aug. 1991)). \\nFurther, the rule of leni ty historically has been \\njustified in part based on the “principle of legality”:  conduct can be criminalized , and penalties author-\\nized, only by legislative action, so “that the amount  \\nof discretion entrusted to those who enforce the law \\ndoes not exceed tolerable lim its.”  Herbert L. Packer, \\nThe Limits of the Criminal Sanction  93 (1968).  As \\nthe Court put it in Marinello v. United States , 138 S. \\nCt. 1101 (2018), “prosecutorial discretion” to enforce \\na statute with “wide-rangin g scope . . . places great \\npower in the hands of the prosecutor,” creating risks of “nonuniform execution” and “arbitary prosecution.”  \\nId. at 1108-09.  That concern is one reason for  \\nthe Court’s “‘traditional[] exercise[]’” of “‘restraint in \\nassessing the reach of a federal criminal statute.’”  Id. at 1109 (quoting United States v. Aguilar , 515 \\nU.S. 593, 600 (1995)).  And it is a special problem \\nwith mandatory minimums that effectively transfer \\nsentencing discretion from the trial judge, “the one \\nactor in the system most ex perienced with exercising \\ndiscretion,” to “an assistant prosecutor not trained in \\nthe exercise of discretion.”   An Address by Anthony \\nM. Kennedy, Associate Justic e, Supreme Court of the \\nUnited States, Speech at the American Bar Associ-\\nation Annual Meeting (Aug. 9, 2003), available at  \\nhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/speeches/sp_08-09-03.html. \\n 12 \\nInconsistently exercised discretion means that, in \\npractice, mandatory minimums fail to yield even \\nuniformity in sentencing – the benefit they are \\nsupposed to obtain at the cost of individual justice \\nand proportionality.  Over decades, the Sentencing \\nCommission has repeatedly reported “inconsisten[cy]” \\nand “wide geographic variations” in the use of mandatory minimum sentences.  E.g., United States \\nSentencing Comm’n, Application and Impact of  \\n21 U.S.C. § 851:  Enhanced  Penalties for Federal \\nDrug Trafficking Offenders  6 (July 2018) (finding \\n“significant variation in the extent to which . . . enhanced penalties were sought against eligible \\noffenders”); see also United States v. Angelos , 345  \\nF. Supp. 2d 1227, 1252 (D. Utah 2004) (discussing \\n“the potential for tremendous sentencing disparity if \\nfederal prosecutors across th e country do not uniformly \\ncharge . . . violations” of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)), aff’d , 433 \\nF.3d 738 (10th Cir. 2006).\\n2   \\n                                                 \\n2 See also  United States Sentencing Comm’n, Mandatory \\nMinimum Penalties for Sex Offenses in the Federal Criminal \\nJustice System  56 (Jan. 2019) (finding that, “[i]n fiscal year \\n2016, the mandatory minimum penalty for receipt [of child por-nography] [wa]s inconsistently applied,” leading to “substantial” \\ndifferences in sentences where “the conduct involved in the  \\noffenses was not meaningfully distinguishable”); United States Sentencing Comm’n, Report to Congress:  Mandatory Minimum \\nPenalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System  345 (Oct. \\n2011) (“2011 Report”) (finding “inconsistencies in application  \\nof certain mandatory minimum penalties, as shown by . . .  \\ndata analyses and confirmed by interviews of prosecutors and \\ndefense attorneys”); United States Sentencing Comm’n, Fifteen \\nYears of Guidelines Sentencing:  An Assessment of How Well  \\nthe Federal Criminal Justice System is Achieving the Goals  of Sentencing Reform  89 (Nov. 2004) (“Research over the past \\nfifteen years has consistently found that mandatory penalty \\nstatutes are used inconsistently in cases in which they appear \\nto apply.”). \\n 13 \\nIndeed, over the last two decades, different \\nAttorneys General have instructed federal prose-\\ncutors differently on how to use mandatory minimum \\nstatutes, switching between more- and less-aggressive \\napproaches.3  In adopting such policies, the executive \\nbranch takes into its own hands the tradeoff between \\nsentencing uniformity, on the one hand, and \\nindividual justice and proportionality, on the other.  Whatever the wisdom of the competing approaches, \\nthat practice emphasizes how mandatory minimum \\nstatutes transfer power over  individual liberty from \\nlawmakers and judges to pr osecutors.  In our adver-\\nsarial system, moreover, pr osecutors can and do use \\nthat power strategically in ways that undermine \\nstructural protections for individual liberties, such as by using the threat of a mandatory minimum to \\nobtain a guilty plea.  See United States v. Kupa ,  \\n976 F. Supp. 2d 417, 420 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) \\n(condemning the practice of “coerc[ing] guilty pleas, \\nand sometimes . . . coerc[ing] cooperation as well,  \\n[by] routinely threaten[ing] ultra-harsh, enhanced mandatory sentences that no one  – not even the \\nprosecutors themselves – thinks are appropriate”) \\n(footnote omitted),  aff ’d, 616 F. App’x 33  (2d Cir. 2015) . \\n                                                 \\n3 See Angelos , 345 F. Supp. 2d at 1253 & n.120 (discussing a \\n2003 memorandum intended “to reduce charging disparities \\nstemming from § 924(c)”); United States Sentencing Comm’n, \\nAn Overview of Mandatory Minim um Penalties in the Federal \\nCriminal Justice System 24-25 (July 2017) (comparing the 2013 \\n“Smart on Crime” initiative, which outlined circumstances  \\nin which prosecutors should “‘decline to charge’” mandatory \\nminimum sentences, to “revised guidance” in 2017 directing \\nprosecutors generally to “‘charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense,’” with seriousness measured by the \\ngreatest sentence, “ ‘including mandatory minimum sentences’ ”). \\n 14 \\nNor does the expansion of prosecutorial power \\nthrough mandatory minimum statutes stop at the \\ncharging stage.  Even after conviction, the prosecutor \\nholds an important key to lessening the effect of a \\nmandatory minimum sentence.  A district court is \\nfreed from restrictions on its sentencing discretion \\n“[u]pon motion of the Government . . . so as to reflect \\na defendant’s substantial assistance in the investi-gation or prosecution of another person,” 18 U.S.C. \\n§ 3553(e), or it can similarly reduce the sentence \\nlater, again with the government’s approval, under \\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b)(4).\\n4  Suc h \\ndiscretionary motions have large effects on \\nsentences, often reducing them by many years.5  \\nResearch has found “enorm ous differences in how \\nprosecutors exercise that di scretion, with substantial \\nvariation by district.”6  Again, within broad constitu-\\ntional bounds, Congress has the power to create such \\na system.  But the Court need not and should not \\nbroaden more than Congress’s language requires \\n                                                 \\n4 In certain cases involving no n-violent drug offenders, a  \\ndistrict judge may invoke 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f), often called a  \\njudicial “safety valve,” but the sa fety valve is “narrow” and still \\nrequires prosecutorial approval in substance if not in form.   \\nRachel E. Barkow, Categorical Mistakes:  The Flawed Frame-\\nwork of the Armed Career Criminal Act and Mandatory Mini-\\nmum Sentencing , 133 Harv. L.

By contrast, the costs of erroneously \\nconstruing a mandatory minimum provision too \\nnarrowly are relatively low, both for individual cases \\nand for the criminal justice system as a whole.  In \\ncases that fall outside the scope of a mandatory \\nminimum, but that nevertheless feature aggravating \\ncircumstances similar to those that moved Congress \\nto impose the minimum, a sentencing judge still has discretion (guided by § 3553(a) and the sentencing \\nguidelines) to impose a more severe sentence.  As Justice Breyer explained in Dean , “an interpretive \\nerror on the side of leniency[] still permits  the \\nsentencing judge to impose a sentence similar to, \\nperhaps close to, the statutor y sentence even if that \\nsentence . . . is not legislatively required .”  556 U.S. \\nat 584 (Breyer, J., dissenting). \\nMoreover, “an error that excludes (erroneously) a \\nset of instances Congress me ant to include . . . could \\nlead the Sentencing Commission to focus on those cases . . . [and] make avail able to Congress a body of \\nevidence and analysis that w ill help it reconsider the \\nstatute.”  Id. at 585.  Those who bring actions under \\nthe criminal laws (the executive branch) have far greater access to thos e who create them (the \\nlegislative branch) than do those who defend against \\nsuch actions (potential criminal defendants).  In light \\nof this practical reality, the rule of lenity “places the \\nweight of inertia upon the party that can best induce \\nCongress to speak more clearly.”  Santos , 553 U.S. at \\n514 (plurality).  \\n 16 \\nB. The Risk of Reading Mandatory Minimums \\nToo Broadly Is Also Particularly High  \\nThe risk of mistaking congressional intent is also \\nunusually high in the case of mandatory minimum \\nprovisions.  Those provisions often do not originate \\nfrom a careful and considered drafting process.   \\nThe history of the “occasions different from one \\nanother” language of § 924(e) (1) is a good example:  \\nas petitioner shows in detail, that language stemmed \\nfrom then-Solicitor-General  Fried’s confession of \\nerror to this Court in Petty v. United States , 481 U.S. \\n1034 (1987) (No. 86-6263).  In that case, the United States candidly admitted that the different-occasions \\nlanguage, present in “other enhanced penalty \\nprovisions,” was omitted from the predecessor to \\n§ 924(e)(1), even though the legislative history \\nshowed “that both Congress and those supporting the legislation, including the Department of Justice, did \\nnot intend that the penalty provision would apply \\nmore broadly than in the case of the other federal \\nenhanced penalty statutes.”   Pet. Br. App. 25a-26a; \\nsee id.  at 26a-31a. \\nHad the United States not taken the unusual step \\nof confessing error in Petty , the courts might well \\nhave concluded – as the Eighth Circuit already had –that Congress had intentionally left the different-occasions language out of th e statute.  After all,  \\nas the Solicitor General’s brief pointed out, courts \\nconstruing statutes often draw a “negative implica-\\ntion” from the omission of  language in one statute \\nthat is present in anot her, similar statute.  Id. at  \\n26a (citing Rodriguez v. United States , 480 U.S. 522, \\n525 (1987) (per curiam)).  An d courts reaching that \\nconclusion would have imposed minimum 15-year \\nsentences, not based on a “genuine[] call[] for th[at] \\n 17 \\npunishment” by “society[’s] . . . representatives,” R.L.C. , \\n503 U.S. at 309 (Scalia, J., concurrring in part and concurring in the judgment), but based on a slip of the legislative pen. \\nThere are other examples.  Indeed, § 924(e) \\npresents one:  its “residual clause” defined a “violent \\nfelony” to include any felony that “involves conduct \\nthat presents a serious potential risk of physical \\ninjury.”  18 U.S.C. § 924( e)(2)(B)(ii).  This Court \\nstruck that clause down as unconstitutionally vague \\nin Johnson v. United States , 576 U.S. 591 (2015), \\nrelying in part on “[n]ine years’ experience trying to derive meaning from the residual clause” as evidence \\nthat the courts had “embarked upon a failed enterprise.”  Id. at 601-02.  And the Court reached \\nthe same conclusion in Davis as to § 924(e)’s cousin \\n§ 924(c), striking down a similarly vague clause that \\ntriggered mandatory minimum sentences of 5, 7, 10, and 25 years.  See 139 S. Ct. at 2325, 2336. \\nIn United States v. O’Brien , 560 U.S. 218 (2010), \\nthe Court described as “ unclear” yet another provi-\\nsion of § 924(c) that i mposed a 30-year mandatory \\nminimum sentence for possessing a machinegun \\nwhile committing certain crimes.  Id. at 227, 229.  \\nFacing that lack of clarity, the Court applied a  five-factor test to determine whether machinegun \\npossession was intended to be an offense element  or as a sentencing factor.  See id. at 227-32.  In \\nGranderson , the Court diplomatically observed that \\n18 U.S.C. § 3565(a), imposi ng a mandatory minimum \\nsentence for certain revocations of parole, did not \\n“appear[] . . . to have received Congress’ careful \\nattention.”  511 U.S. at 42.  Justice Scalia less \\ndiplomatically called § 3565(a) “wretchedly drafted.”  \\nId. at 60 (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment). \\n 18 \\nThe Court’s repeated struggles with opaque text \\nand structure in mandatory minimum provisions  \\nare the kind of “experience”  that is “the life of the \\nlaw.”  Johnson , 576 U.S. at 601.  That experience \\nteaches that mandatory minimum sentencing statutes, including the one at issue here, commonly \\nuse “sweeping and imprecise language” that “set[s] \\nup a host of vexing constitutional and statutory \\ninterpretation questions for the courts.”  Barkow, \\nCategorical Mistakes , 133 Harv. L. Rev. at 202.   \\nThe rule of lenity, “as a so rt of ‘junior version of  \\nthe vagueness doctrine,’” United States v. Lanier , \\n520 U.S. 259, 266 (1997) (quoting Packer, Criminal \\nSanction  at 95), is a useful doctrinal approach to \\nanswering those questions.  If the Court finds the \\nstatute now before it ambiguous, lenity can help – \\nand an emphasis on lenity in the context of \\nmandatory minimum statutes can help guide the \\nlower courts to solve futu re, similar problems that \\nwill inevitably arrive.\\n7 \\n                                                 \\n7 Some have stated that “a court must find not just ambiguity \\nbut ‘grievous ambiguity’ before resorting to the rule of lenity.”  \\nShular v. United States , 140 S. Ct. 779, 788 & n.2 (2020)  \\n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (collecting examples).  Other recent decisions, drawing on a long line of authority, have applied \\nprinciples of lenity without the adjective “grievous.”  See, e.g., \\nDavis , 139 S. Ct. at 2333 (invoking lenity where “a criminal \\nstatute . . . d[id] not clearly proscribe” conduct and stating that \\n“ambiguities about the breadth of a criminal statute should  be resolved in the defendant’s favor”).  The notion that lenity \\napplies only in cases of “grievous ambiguity” appeared in this \\nCourt’s cases relatively recently.  See Chapman v. United \\nStates , 500 U.S. 453, 463 (1991) (quoting Huddleston v. United \\nStates , 415 U.S. 814, 831 (1974), which had stated that the \\nCourt “perceive[d] no grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in” a \\nstatute before it, id., but did not suggest that “grievous ambigu-\\nity” was a threshold requirement for any reliance on lenity).  \\nThe rule of lenity itself goes back for centuries.  In any event, \\n 19 \\nII. JUDICIAL EXPERIEN CE WITH 18 U.S.C. \\n§ 924(e)(1) SUPPORTS APPLYING THE \\nRULE OF LENITY \\nPetitioner’s brief ably sets forth why the Sixth \\nCircuit’s analysis finds no support in the ACCA’s \\ntext, history, or purpose.  FAMM agrees that this \\nCourt can and should reverse the judgment of the \\nSixth Circuit without resort to the rule of lenity or the principles that underlie it.  If the Court finds the \\nquestion close, however, it may help to consider \\njudicial experience applying the same standard that \\nthe Sixth Circuit applied here.  Examining that \\nexperience counsels in favor of lenity. \\nThat experience shows that the approach of the \\ncourt of appeals – asking wh ether “it [is] possible to \\ndiscern the point at which the first offense is \\ncompleted and the subsequent point at which the \\nsecond offense begins,” JA22 – does not satisfy this \\nCourt’s teaching that “so far as possible the line should be clear.”  McBoyle , 283 U.S. at 27.  Nor does \\nthat test align, in any way “the common world will \\nunderstand,” id., with Congress’s effo rt to classify as \\nan armed career criminal someone who has “three previous convictions . . . for a violent felony or a \\nserious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions \\ndifferent from one another, ” 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1).  \\nInstead, the temporal-sequencing test is at best “no \\nmore than a guess as to what Congress intended,” \\nLadner , 358 U.S. at 178 – a guess that produces \\narbitrary and unpredictable results. \\n                                                                                                   \\nwhere all the tools of statutory construction fail to resolve genu-\\nine ambiguity as to whether Congress has demanded a manda-\\ntory prison term, that ambiguity can fairly be called “grievous.” \\n 20 \\nA. Entries of Separate Structures on a Single \\nDay or Night Are Not Clearly Multiple  \\nDifferent “Occasions”  \\n1. The decision under review  is a useful starting \\npoint.  According to the Sixth Circuit, all 10 of Wooden’s 1997 convictions for burglary, which took \\nplace on a single night, were “separate ACCA \\npredicate offenses” that occurred on “‘occasions \\ndifferent from one another.’”  JA21 (quoting 18 \\nU.S.C. § 924(e)(1)).  To support that conclusion, the court of appeals reasoned that, “[w]hatever the \\ncontours of a ‘mini’ wareho use, Wooden could not be \\nin two (let alone ten) of them  at once”; that he “could \\nhave ceased his criminal conduct” after entering the \\nfirst warehouse without en tering nine more; and \\nthat, although “one could characterize th[e] cluster of \\nwarehouses as being adjoined ‘at the same business location,’” they were “different locations” because  \\ntheir owners had “distinct se ts of property rights.”  \\nJA23-24. \\nWooden argues persuasively (at 30) that the \\n“textual foundations” for the court of appeals’ “test \\n. . . are essentially nonexistent.”  Even if the statute \\ndoes not wholly foreclose th at test, it certainly gives \\nno fair warning that unlawfully entering 10 small \\nwarehouses within the same building on a single \\nevening triggers a harsh 15-year penalty for later \\nowning a gun, while spending the same amount  \\nof time in a single warehouse would not.  The court  \\nof appeals’ analysis thus  “mak[es] criminal law  \\nin Congress’s stead.”  Santos , 553 U.S. at 514 \\n(plurality).  At best it is judicial doctrine built up  \\nto cover the lack of clarity in the statute, rather  \\nthan anything that can claim to be an application of \\nthe statute itself.  Those who agree with Justice \\nScalia that “it is not consistent with the rule of lenity \\n 21 \\nto construe a textually ambiguous penal statute \\nagainst a criminal defendant on the basis of legis-\\nlative history,” R.L.C. , 503 U.S. at 307 (Scalia, J., \\nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment), \\ncan stop there, because the statute is at least \\ntextually ambiguous.   \\nThose who look to legislative history as an \\ninterpretive guide should reach the same ultimate \\nconclusion.  As Wooden persuasively shows (at 21-\\n25), that history ranges fr om an Assistant Attorney \\nGeneral’s 1984 testimony that the statute was meant \\nto catch “people who have demonstrated . . . that \\nlocking them up and letting them go doesn’t do any \\ngood,” Pet. Br. Add. 29a; to the Solicitor General’s 1987 concession in Petty that the statute was \\n“intended” to cover “multiple criminal episodes,” id. \\nat 26a; to then-Senator Biden’s 1988 statement that \\nthe statute was meant to “express[] [a] concept of \\nwhat is meant by a ‘career criminal,’” 134 Cong. Rec. S17,370 (daily ed. Nov. 10, 1988).  None of this \\nsuggests an intent – let alone a clear one – to \\nconsider multiple offenses on a single night to be a \\ncareer in crime because it took a few seconds to move \\nfrom one mini-warehouse to another within a cluster \\nof such warehouses. \\n2. The Fourth Circuit’s decision in United States \\nv. Carr , 592 F.3d 636 (4th Cir. 2010), illustrates the \\nsame point.  That case involved Daryl Carr, who possessed a firearm after previously pleading guilty \\nto 13 state-law charges of “felony breaking or entering.”  Id. at 638.  Those 13 offenses all took \\nplace on a single day in 2006 during which Carr broke into each of 13 “different storage unit[s]” at  \\nthe same street addres s (“N.C. 32 South”).  Id.  The \\ncourt of appeals conceded that the offenses were \\n“substantively the same and arguably had the same \\n 22 \\ncriminal objective,” but it nevertheless found them  \\nto be “separate and distinct criminal episodes.”  Id.  \\nat 645.  It reasoned that  the storage units were \\n“different locations”; that mo st, though not all, of the \\noffenses had “different victims”; and that Carr “had \\nthe opportunity . . . to cease and desist his criminal \\nbehavior” between one storage unit and the next, \\nadding in a footnote that “Carr simply could not have \\nbroken into or entered the 13 separate storage units simultaneously.”  Id. at 645 & n.8 (citation omitted).\\n8 \\nIn that analysis, the Fourth Circuit asserted that \\nthe statutory “‘definition may be clear’” but conceded \\nthat “‘the factual permutations surrounding the \\nACCA tend to create havoc’”; that “‘courts have \\napplied a multiplicity of factors’” in cases involving \\n§ 924(e); and that the “analysis” has a “fluid nature.”  Id. at 640 (quoting United States v. Letterlough ,  \\n63 F.3d 332, 335 (4th Cir.  1995)).  That sort of \\nassessment ought to be a warning sign in construing a criminal statute:  it calls to mind this Court’s \\nobservation in Johnson that “pervasive disagreement \\nabout the nature of the inquiry one is supposed to \\nconduct and the kinds of factors one is supposed to \\nconsider” is a sign of unacceptable vagueness.  576 \\nU.S. at 601.  The present case, to be sure, is not  \\na vagueness challenge.  But the rule of lenity – and  \\nthe “constitutional principles underlying th[at] rule,” \\nDavis , 139 S. Ct. at 2333 n. 8 – counsels against \\nadopting a line of authority whose own proponents \\nreport fluidity at best and havoc at worst. \\n                                                 \\n8 In another footnote, the Fourth Circuit noted that Carr had \\nother “state convictions” on different dates, at least one of which \\ninvolved “assault by pointing a gun,” Carr , 592 F.3d at 639 n.3, \\nbut did not analyze whether they  constituted ACCA predicates \\nor rely on them for its holding. \\n 23 \\n3. The Seventh Circuit’s decision in United States \\nv. Hudspeth , 42 F.3d 1015 (7th Cir. 1994) (en banc), \\ninvolved Thomas Hudspeth, who on one day in 1983 broke into three businesses – “a doughnut shop, a dry \\ncleaners, and an insurance company.”  Id. at 1018-19.  \\nThe businesses were in the same “strip mall,” id., \\nwhere the burglars made “a hole through [a] shared wall” and “forced open the door” connecting two of \\nthe businesses, id. at 1022.  The whole affair took \\n“approximately thirty-five minutes.”  Id. at 1018-19.  \\nA majority of the Seventh Circuit held that, because Hudspeth’s three offenses were “committed sequen-\\ntially, against different victims, at different times, \\nand at different locations,” they were “clearly crimes \\n‘committed on occasions different from one another.’”  Id. at 1021. \\nOne concurrence reasoned that Hudspeth was \\n“appropriately sentenced because . . . the record shows three separate crimes against separate victims \\nand not a single crime or criminal occasion (whatever that is).”  Id. at 1025 (Bauer, J., concurring).  One \\npartial dissent noted that past decisions had “grappl[ed] with the ambi guity of the ACCA” and \\nnoted “the malleability of the relevant terms,” including the different-occasions language.  Id. at \\n1025-26 (Flaum, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Another, joined by  five of the 11 judges who \\nheard the case, agreed that the “cold print of the \\nstatute books” did not answ er the question before  \\nthe court and argued for interpreting § 924(e) as  \\na “congressional mandate . . . to identify the true recidivist.”  Id. at 1034, 1037 (Ripple, J., concurring \\nin part and dissenting in part).  \\nNone of the opinions in Hudspeth suggested \\napplying the rule of lenity.  Yet at least six members \\n 24 \\nof the en banc court – counting Judge Bauer, whose \\nconcurrence expressed marked frustration with the \\nstatutory language – appear to have found no answer \\nto the question before them in § 924(e).9  As judicial \\nexperience goes, that is further evidence that \\n“Congress le[ft] to the Judiciary the task of imputing \\nto Congress an undeclared will,” Bell, 349 U.S. at 83, \\nconcerning prior offenses that occur over a short \\nperiod of time in several adjacent structures. \\nB. Evading or Resisting Arrest Does Not \\nClearly Involve Multiple Different “Occa-\\nsions”  \\nAnother  situation that repeatedly arises under \\n§ 924(e) is an offense af ter which the defendant \\nevades or resists arrest.  A rule that focuses on \\nsequence in time treats evasion or resistance as a \\ndifferent “occasion,” because it is possible to imagine a point at which the defendant stops the first offense \\nand starts running.  But an ordinary person trying  \\nto figure out the meaning of the statute from its \\nwords would not likely reach that conclusion.  Nor  \\ndo the tools of statutory construction suggest that \\nCongress meant to treat such an offender as a career \\ncriminal deserving 15 years in prison. \\n1. In United States v. Schieman , 894 F.2d 909 \\n(7th Cir. 1990), David Schi eman received a 15-year \\nsentence based in part on prior convictions of \\nburglary and aggravated batte ry of a police officer.  \\nId. at 910.  As a partial dissent explained:  \\n                                                 \\n9 Hudspeth relied on police reports to determine the circum-\\nstances of prior offenses; Shepard v. United States , 544 U.S. 13, \\n16 (2005), later barred courts from considering police reports  \\nin applying § 924(e).  The Seventh Circuit has since cited  \\nHudspeth as “abrogated” at least in part by Shepard .  See, e.g., \\nUnited States v. Elliott , 703 F.3d 378, 384 n.3 (7th Cir. 2012). \\n 25 \\nSchieman committed a robbery, walked three \\nblocks away to make a telephone call [at a phone \\nbooth] to arrange transportation away from the \\nscene, and, in an attempt to evade apprehension, \\npushed a police officer at the phone booth.  The \\npushing incident occurred approximately five \\nminutes after the robbery. \\nId. at 913 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and \\ndissenting in part).  The majority reasoned that, “[o]nce the original crime is complete, there is no \\nprincipled way to distinguish” between a battery \\n“within ten minutes of the burglary” and one “a day after the burglary.”  Id. at  913 (majority). \\nOne giving the words “different” and “occasion” \\ntheir ordinary meaning might well think that both \\nSchieman’s burglary and his attempt to escape five \\nminutes later occurred on the same occasion.  One \\nthinking of the statute as an attempt to identify \\ncareer criminals would reach the same result.  And \\nthe Schieman court’s reasoning only emphasizes  \\nhow traditional principles of lenity support that conclusion.  The court took a case it thought clear \\n(escape a day later) and used it to resolve a case  \\nit thought unclear (escape five minutes later) by \\narguing the lack of a “principled . . . distin[ction]” \\nbetween the two.  But the felt need to invoke the day-after hypothetical itself shows that the statute does \\nnot speak clearly to the five -minute case.  The court’s \\nrole was therefore to limit the 15-year sanction to the \\ncase where it was unambiguously intended. \\n2. In United States v. Davidson , 527 F.3d 703 \\n(8th Cir. 2008), vacated in part on other grounds , 551 \\nF.3d 807 (8th Cir. 2008) (per curiam), Mark Davidson \\nwas sentenced under § 924(e)  based on prior convic-\\ntions that included an attempted domestic assault \\n 26 \\nand fleeing from a police officer who interrupted that \\nattempt with a traffic stop.  Id. at 707.  The Seventh \\nCircuit conceded that the “pause between the two offenses was brief” and that the crimes were \\ncommitted in “rapid succession,” but reasoned that  \\na “moment of relative calm” had occurred when  \\nthe officer stopped Davidson, creating “a point of \\ndemarcation between episodes” that justified treating \\nDavidson’s prior convictions as separate.  Id. at 710. \\nThe Davidson court candidly acknowledged that \\nthe circuits had “struggled with th[e] problem” of applying § 924(e) to resist ance or evasion offenses, \\n“reaching arguably inconsistent results,” id. at 709, \\ndiscussing Schieman and other examples.  Considered \\nas an exercise in the common-law method, the “point of demarcation” analysis that Davidson derived \\nmight not be exceptional.  But it has been settled \\nsince United States v. Hudson , 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 32 \\n(1812), that “federal crimes . . . are solely creatures of \\nstatute,” Liparota v. United States , 471 U.S. 419, 424 \\n(1985), a principle that lenity helps protect, see id. at \\n427-28.  And the distinction that Davidson and cases \\nlike it draw – if it can even be squared with the \\nstatute at all – is clearly a rule made by the courts \\nrather than one set down by statute. \\n3. In Levering v. United States , 890 F.3d 738 (8th \\nCir. 2018), Merwyn Leveri ng was sentenced under \\n§ 924(e) based on prior convictions that included at \\nleast two assaults in the cour se of a high-speed flight \\nfrom police officers in a stolen automobile.  Id. at \\n739.  Levering argued that the assaults were not committed on different occasions because the flight \\nwas a “‘continuous course of conduct.’”  Id. at 741.  \\nThe Eighth Circuit acknowledged that “the phrase \\n‘continuous course of conduct’ appears in our cases on \\n 27 \\nthis subject,” but rejected  it as “unhelpful to the \\nanalysis.”  Id. at 742.  Instead, the court relied on the \\nfact that the assaults were committed “at different times in different counties against different victims.”  \\nId.  The Eighth Circuit acknowledged that several \\nunpublished decisions from the Sixth Circuit pointed \\nto a different result, but “respectfully differ[ed]” with them.  Id.   \\nLike the Fourth Circuit’s acknowledgment of “havoc” \\nin Carr , the vigorous disagreement among members \\nof the Seventh Circuit in Hudspeth , and the Eighth \\nCircuit’s own earlier acknowledgment of “arguabl[e] \\ninconsisten[cy]” in Davidson , the reasoning of \\nLevering points to the type of pervasive uncertainty \\nabout statutory application that suggests courts have gone beyond the guidance that an unclear statute \\ncan offer.  It is especially  telling that – as the Eighth \\nCircuit’s criticism of the Sixth Circuit shows – courts theoretically applying the sa me sequential test reach \\ndifferent results as to similarly situated defendants. \\n4. None of this is to deny that fleeing from arrest \\nand assaulting someone while doing so is not serious misconduct that state and sometimes federal law \\nproperly criminalize.  The police officer in Schieman \\ncould have been hurt, as could the bystanders to the \\nhigh-speed chases in Davidson and Levering .  Nor is \\nthere any doubt that after their prior convictions the \\nvarious defendants were prohibited from possessing guns, see 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), and could be punished \\nfor breaking that law.  The function of § 924(e), \\nhowever – as its text, structure, and history all show – is to carve out a special set of repeat offenders, \\nlabeled as “armed career criminals,” for special \\ncondemnation and harsh mandatory punishment.  It \\nis impossible to read the cases struggling with these \\n 28 \\nissues and conclude that the legislature has “clearly \\nsaid” that those defendants should “languish[] in \\nprison,” Bass , 404 U.S. at 348 (cit ation omitted), for \\nat least 15 years. \\nCONCLUSION \\nThe court of appeals’ judgment should be reversed. \\n \\n \\nMARY PRICE \\nGENERAL COUNSEL  \\nFAMM 1100 H Street, N.W. \\nSuite 1000 \\nWashington, D.C. 20005 (202) 822-6700 \\n \\n \\n \\nMay 10, 2021\\n \\n Respectfully submitted, \\n \\nGREGORY G.

PSYCH . 529 (2008) ............................ 7 \\n1 \\n INTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE1 \\n Amicus Curiae  are a non-Indian couple, Aubrey \\nNelson and Sam Evans-Brown, who adopted an Indian \\nchild, M.E. Aubrey and Sam decided to adopt because they wanted to grow their family, share their love with \\na child who needed a home, and  give their first child a \\nsibling while Aubrey was recovering from complica-tions attributable to birth injuries. Their adoption at-\\ntorney referred them to an agency in Arizona, which \\nconnected them with a bi rthmother named \\\"Tina.\\\"\\n2 \\nAubrey and Sam were overjoyed that Tina chose them \\nbut were confused about pressure from the adoption \\nattorneys involved to keep the adoption closed to any \\ncontact with M.E.'s Tribes. Aubrey and Sam strongly \\nbelieve in the importance of open adoptions because \\nopenness confers many long-term benefits on all par-ties\\u2014adoptive parents, birth parents, and children, \\nIndian and non-Indian alike. \\n Aubrey and Sam support the Indian Child Wel-\\nfare Act (the ICWA), including the placement prefer-\\nences, because it promotes open adoptions for Indian \\n \\n 1 All parties have consented to the filing of this brief. No \\ncounsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part, and no counsel or party made a monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation or submission of this brief. No person other than Amicus Curiae , its members, or its coun sel made a monetary con-\\ntribution to its preparation or submission. \\n \\n2 To protect the birth mother's privacy, Amicus Curiae  refer \\nto her by a pseudonym. In addition, although some birth mothers prefer other language, such as \\\"first mother,\\\" Amicus Curiae  use \\n\\\"birth mother\\\" or \\\"birth pare nt\\\" because those terms are com-\\nmonly used in adoption literature. \\n2 \\n children, and they believe keeping M.E. connected to \\nher time-honored tribal customs and traditions is in \\nher best interests. Had a member of M.E.'s family been \\navailable to adopt her, Aubrey and Sam would have supported such a placement because they believe it is \\nimportant to keep families together when possible and \\nbelieve that familial placement would have kept M.E. directly connected with her tribal community. It is be-\\ncause Aubrey and Sam love their daughter so fiercely \\nand believe that M.E. has a right to know her Tribes, her culture, and her extended family, that they submit \\nthis brief in support of the ICWA. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nINTRODUCTION AND \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\n The benefits of adoption are well established. \\nAdoption allows birth parents to give their children a \\nfamily when they are unable to provide one; adoptive \\nparents can start or grow a family and raise happy, \\nhealthy children; and adoption gives children the gift \\nof a loving, supportive home. The ICWA's procedural and substantive requirements increase the benefits of \\nadoptions by creating a platform for openness in adop-\\ntions and a conduit to Tribal identity. \\n Openness in adoptions reflects the understanding \\nthat communication between birth parents, adoptive parents, and children confers distinct and important \\nadvantages to all parties. Op enness in adoption bene-\\nfits all parties by giving access to vital information \\n3 \\n such as medical and genetic hi story. It also allows chil-\\ndren to maintain important connections to culture and \\nextended family. Open adoptions are particularly im-\\nportant for Indian children because openness allows Indian children to maintain political ties to their In-\\ndian Tribes and receive the ad vantages that come with \\ntribal membership. Without the ICWA's substantive and procedural bulwarks it is too easy for Indian chil-\\ndren to lose essential connection to their Tribal iden-\\ntity. \\n In addition to cultivating a landscape of openness, \\nthe ICWA allows, and sometimes gives greater prefer-ence to, non-Indians seeking to adopt or foster Indian \\nchildren, as demonstrated by Aubrey and Sam's and \\nthe Individual Plaintiffs' stories of successful adoption. And these stories are not unique. Indian children are \\nadopted or fostered by non-Indian families every year. \\nEven if the ICWA prohibited adoption or fostering by non-Indians, which it does  not, there simply are not \\nenough Indian homes for Indian children. Non-Indian \\nfamilies are therefore needed to give Indian children loving homes. \\n Moreover, the first preference under the ICWA for \\nadoption or foster care is placement with extended \\nfamily, a category that includes both Indians and non-\\nIndians because the ICWA does not differentiate be-tween the two when it discusses family. The ICWA's \\npreference for placement with extended family is con-\\nsistent with numerous state laws that give preference to extended family placements. Additionally, when \\nmultiple placement options are available, the \\\"good \\n4 \\n cause\\\" exception to the ICWA's placement preferences \\nallows courts to balance the best interests of the Indian \\nchild against other factors that may warrant place-\\nment outside of the preferences. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nARGUMENT \\nI. OPENNESS IN AD OPTION AND CONNEC-\\nTION TO FAMILIES AND TRIBES IS IN \\nTHE BEST INTEREST  OF CHILDREN. \\n The ICWA serves as a crucial tool for openness in \\nadoptions because it informs Indian children of their identity and heritage. Without the ICWA's conduit \\nconnecting Indian children to their Tribes, many adop-\\ntions, such as the one Aubrey and Sam experienced, are shrouded in secrecy, a pro cess which only serves to \\nhurt children, birth parents, and adoptive parents. The \\nICWA gives Tribes the tools necessary to participate in placement proceedings to ensure that Indian children \\nremain connected and aware of their customs and tra-\\nditions. See, e.g., 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1912(a) (providing notice \\nrequirements so that Tribes are informed when Indian \\nchildren are in involuntary placement proceedings).\\n3 \\n \\n 3 The requirement of notice under 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1912(a) does \\nnot apply to voluntary adoption proceedings such as Aubrey \\nand Sam's. However, providing notice to Tribes in voluntary pro-ceedings fosters openness and se veral states have enacted no-\\ntice requirements that also apply to voluntary proceedings. \\nSee, e.g., Iowa Code Ann. \\u00a7 232B.5(8) (2022) (providing notice to \\nTribes in voluntary proceedings); Minn. Stat. Ann. \\u00a7 260.761(3) (2021) (providing notice to Tribes in voluntary adoptive and pre-adoptive proceedings); 10 Okla. Stat. Ann. \\u00a7 10-40.4 (2022) (providing \\n \\n5 \\n The ICWA therefore fosters a culture of openness in \\nadoption that leads to many positive outcomes from \\nopen adoptions and a connection to one's familial and \\ncultural identity. \\n \\nA. Openness in Adoption. \\n For much of the 20th century, adoptions were se-\\ncretive affairs where parents did not tell their children that they were adopted or who their birth parents \\nwere. See Deborah H. Siegel & Susan Livingston \\nSmith, Openness in Adoption from Secrecy and Stigma \\nto Knowledge and Connections , Evan B. Donaldson \\nAdoption Institute at 5 (M ar. 2012). Closed adoptions\\u2014\\nwhere there is little to no contact between children and \\ntheir birth parents\\u2014reflect societal attitudes from the \\nearly and mid-20th century, when parents and state \\nlegislatures sought to protect adopted children from the stigma of illegitimacy, misplaced fear that birth \\nparents would eventually \\\"take back\\\" the child, and \\nthe mistaken belief that adopted children could simply\\u2014and without question\\u2014assume their adoptive \\nparents' family history and culture. Secrecy and confi-\\ndentiality, despite the adoptive parents' best intentions and efforts, often led to adopted adolescents having un-\\nresolved identity questions concerning their family \\nhistory and the reason for their adoption. \\n \\nnotice to Tribes in voluntary proceedings); N.M. Stat. Ann. \\n\\u00a7 32A-28-2 (defining child custody proceeding to include adoptive placement) and \\u00a7 32A-28-5 (requiri ng notice for all child custody \\nproceedings). \\n6 \\n  Societal attitudes shifted slowly towards some \\nform of open adoptions\\u2014in which children are aware \\nwho their birth parents are and have varying degrees \\nof contact with them\\u2014or some form of mediated adop-tion\\u2014in which the adoption agency facilitates some \\nform of regular contact between birth parents and \\ntheir children.\\n4 In 1997, for instance, only 16% of re-\\nspondents to a national survey by the Evan B. Don-\\naldson Adoption Institute approved of birth mothers \\nsending cards or letters to adoptive families, with the majority of respondents saying it was only acceptable \\nin some or very few cases.\\n5 The last few decades, how-\\never, have seen a paradigmat ic shift\\u2014so much so that, \\nas of 2012, closed adoptions represented only about 5% \\nof placements, whereas 55% of placements were fully \\ndisclosed, and 40% were mediated.6 \\n The shift toward openness is an important devel-\\nopment that reflects the now-widespread understand-ing that secrecy in adoptions has a negative impact on \\nadopted children, birth parents, and adoptive parents. \\nOpen adoptions come with many benefits including measurably increased satisfaction and peace of mind \\n \\n 4 Amicus Curiae  recognize that open adoptions may not be \\npossible in some cases, such as international adoption, or may not \\nbe advisable in some cases, such as if severe abuse was involved. \\n 5 See Deborah H.

This type of \\ninformation facilitates identity formation, as well as \\npositive feelings toward their birth parents and others. Further, open adoptions help children cope with the \\nuncertainty and the ambiguous sense of loss that come \\nfrom \\\"losing\\\" birth parents, because openness gives children a link to their b iological families and commu-\\nnity.\\n11 In addition, children in open adoptions reported \\nhigher self-esteem, their parents rated them lower in behavioral problems, and th eir families reported more \\ntrust for their parents, fewe r feelings of alienation and \\nbetter overall family functioning.\\n12 \\n \\nB. Sam and Aubrey's Adoption Story. \\n In early 2020, Aubrey Nelson and Sam Evans-\\nBrown wanted to grow their family and give their first child a sibling. However, a year and a half after their \\nson was born, Aubrey was still recovering from compli-\\ncations stemming from birth injuries. As a result, the \\n \\n(2007); Gretchen M. Wrobel et al., Openness In Adoption and the \\nLevel of Child Participation , 67 C HILD  DEV. 2358 (1996). \\n 11 See Kimberly A. Powell & Tamara D. Afifi, Uncertainty \\nManagement and Adoptees' Ambiguous Loss of their Birth Par-ents, 22 J. S\\nOC. & P ERS. RELATIONSHIPS  129 (2005). \\n 12 See Julie K. Kohler et al., Adopted Adolescents' Preoccupa-\\ntion with Adoption: The Impact on Adoptive Family Relationships , \\n64 J. M ARRIAGE  & F AMILY  93 (2002). \\n9 \\n couple decided to share their love with a child who \\nneeded a home, and they began exploring adoption. \\nThe couple reside in New Hampshire, and through \\nword of mouth they sett led on a well-known New \\nHampshire adoption attorney, completed the necessary \\npaperwork and home study, and paid the attorney's \\nfees. Their New Hampshire attorney worked with a lawyer in Arizona and an agency, Arizona Adoption \\nHelp, to locate potential birth mothers. \\n After completing their paperwork, Aubrey and \\nSam began receiving emails from Arizona Adoption \\nHelp about potential birth mothers and potential adop-\\ntive children. If they were \\\"interested\\\" in the child, the \\nadoption agency instructed them to indicate their in-\\nterest, at which point the agency would \\\"share\\\" their \\nprofile with the birth mother. For each of these profiles, \\nthe adoption agency estimate d the cost of the adoption, \\nwhich typically was $30,000 for the Arizona attorney (which included birth parent  living expenses), $2,500 \\nfor a counselor hired by the adoption agency (who, in \\nAubrey and Sam's case, also served as the notary on the adoption paperwork), and $14,000 for the New \\nHampshire attorney. The cost to adopt would therefore \\nrange from $40,000 to $50,000, and adoption was not guaranteed. The costs for ea ch adoption were mostly \\nthe same, but with added complication and cost for \\nadopting an Indian child. Sam and Aubrey were later informed that this was due to the need to comply with \\nthe ICWA, but aside from hiring another attorney at \\nan extra cost and a longer stay in Arizona in order  to \\\"deal with ICWA,\\\" no other details were readily \\n10 \\n provided about what was required to comply. This was \\nsomewhat perplexing to Sam and Aubrey because the \\nadoption agency also strongly discouraged any commu-\\nnication with an Indian child's Tribe. \\n A birth mother named Tina living in Phoenix, Ar-\\nizona, ultimately selected Aubrey and Sam as adoptive parents. Tina reported that her great grandmother \\nwas Cherokee. The alleged father of the baby girl was \\na Navajo tribal member but was not involved in the adoption or in a relationship with Tina, and he never \\nestablished paternity. Neither the Cherokee nor the \\nNavajo Nations were involved in the adoption, and Tina's adoption attorney from Arizona Adoption Help \\nadvised Aubrey and Sam that, due to the Indian ances-\\ntry involved, \\\"the safest course would be for your cli-ents to retain [another attorney] to represent birth \\nparents in taking ICWA consents.\\\" The lawyers in the \\ncase also strongly discouraged any contact with Tina during the process. Aubrey and Sam were thrilled that \\nTina chose them but were co nfused about the secrecy \\nsurrounding M.E.'s tribal status. \\n Tina gave birth to a baby girl on September 11, \\n2020, in Phoenix, Arizona. Almost immediately, the baby girl was placed with Sam and Aubrey, and they \\nnamed her M.E. Twelve days later, the mother's attor-\\nney filed a consent to voluntary termination of paren-tal rights on behalf of Tina in the Coconino County \\nSuperior Court in Flagstaff, Arizona, a court over 150 \\nmiles from Tina's residence. In Arizona, an adoption petition should be filed in the court of the county where \\n11 \\n the prospective adoptive parent resides,13 and no party \\nto the case resided in Coconino County. Aubrey and \\nSam were later informed by mother's attorney that Co-\\nconino County was a better forum for ICWA cases. Au-brey and Sam believe the forum was chosen to prevent \\nany tribal involvement. \\n Fourteen days after M.E. was born, the Judge in \\nCoconino County issued an Order terminating the pa-\\nrental rights of Tina. The Judge held that although the ICWA applied to M.E., there was \\\"good cause\\\" to devi-\\nate from the placement preferences based on the Tina's \\nrequest to deviate from the preferences,\\n14 and placed \\nthe child with Aubrey and Sam. Again, although they \\nwere happy that the Court pl aced M.E. with them, they \\nhad concerns that Tina was not fully informed about ICWA or her options. This concern arose because the \\nattorneys involved only pe rmitted limited contact with \\nTina, especially before M.E.'s birth. The attorneys told Aubrey and Sam they should not ask Tina about M.E.'s \\nheritage and the attorneys themselves ignored Sam \\nand Aubrey's request that they obtain and share de-tails about M.E.'s Cherokee heritage. Aubrey and Sam \\nwere also prevented from discussing other adoption de-\\ntails with Tina, including her preferences about con-tacting M.E.'s Tribes. Although Aubrey and Sam now \\n \\n 13 See Ariz. Rev. Stat. \\u00a7 8-104 (providing that venue for adop-\\ntion proceedings is appropriate \\\"in the county where the prospec-tive adoptive parent resides or, if applicable, in the county where the child is a ward\\\"). \\n \\n14 Good cause may be based on the preference of the parent. \\nSee 25 C.F.R. \\u00a7 23.132(c)(1). \\n12 \\n exchange messages with Tina regarding M.E., Aubrey \\nand Sam still do not underst and why the adoption was \\nshrouded in secrecy when Aubrey, Sam and Tina's \\ngoals were M.E.'s best interests, which necessarily in-cludes open communication about M.E.'s tribal mem-\\nbership and heritage. \\n The attorneys involved in M.E.'s adoption also \\nasked Aubrey and Sam to submit written verification \\nthat they would not enroll M.E. or have any contact \\nwith the Navajo or Cherokee Nations for at least five \\nyears. Although they felt pressured to sign the docu-\\nment, they declined. Aubrey and Sam want their daughter, M.E., to know where she comes from, and \\nthey believe that it is in her best interest to have a con-\\nnection to her Tribes, because of the importance of fam-ily history, access to ho nored Tribal customs and \\ntraditions, and political membership. See, e.g., Samuel-\\nson v. Little River Band of Ottawa Indians-Enrollment Comm'n , 06-113-AP, 2007 WL 6900788, at 2 (Little \\nRiver Ct. App. 2007) (\\\"Tribal membership for Indian \\npeople . . . is the essence of one's identity, belonging to \\ncommunity, connection to one's heritage and an affir-\\nmation of their human being place in this life and \\nworld.\\\"). Had things been different\\u2014for instance if M.E.'s family, such as an aunt, uncle or grandparent, \\nor other extended family, were available to adopt \\nM.E.\\u2014Aubrey and Sam would have supported appli-cation of the placement preferences and not sought to \\ndeviate under a good cause exception. They support \\nkeeping children with their families when possible, es-pecially if that means that a child retains a close \\n13 \\n connection with their family, Tribe, and community. In \\naddition, during the adoption Aubrey and Sam were \\naware that the ICWA did not require them to keep \\nM.E.'s adoption a secret or refrain from contacting the Navajo or the Cherokee Nations. To the contrary, Au-\\nbrey and Sam believe the ICWA encourages connection \\nbetween Indian children and their Tribes and deter-mines that these relationship s are in their best inter-\\nests. \\n Aubrey and Sam believe that the private adoption \\nindustry, or at least some of  its participants, purposely \\nobfuscate the ICWA's requirements and unnecessarily push adoptive parents towards closed adoptions, re-\\ngardless of an adoptive parents' wishes, in order to \\nkeep Indian children like M.E. separated from their Tribes. In the end, these se cretive practices only serve \\nto hurt children and prospecti ve adoptive families and \\nimpede the ICWA's procedural requirements that fa-cilitate openness in adoption. Aubrey and Sam's prior-\\nity is M.E.'s well-being, and they understand that the \\nICWA serves M.E.'s best interests by establishing a connection with her tribal community and by ensuring \\nthat M.E. is placed in a loving and caring home. \\n For instance, Aubrey and Sam only learned about \\naw\\u00e9\\u00e9' ch'ideeldloh  (first laugh ceremony)\\u2013\\u2013a tradi-\\ntional Navajo celebration that marks a baby's progres-sion toward a healthy life and  is customarily organized \\nby the person who made a ne w baby laugh for the first \\ntime\\u2013\\u2013nearly a year after it would have been appropri-ate to hold this gathering. This is just one early missed \\nopportunity to connect M.E. and the rest of her family \\n14 \\n to her heritage, and an example of why many children \\nin closed adoptions struggle to form strong identities. \\nDespite missing this important Navajo tradition, Au-\\nbrey and Sam have taken steps to open the adoption. For instance, they remain in touch with Tina, and pro-\\nvide her with updates about M.E. Tina has expressed \\nher hopes for M.E. and h elped connect Aubrey and \\nSam to the putative father. Sam and Aubrey also wrote \\nto one of M.E.'s Tribes and  asked for information on \\nhow they might establish a relationship with an indi-vidual willing to serve as a cultural mentor for their \\nfamily. The information Sam and Aubrey have learned \\nhas been helpful in planning to support M.E.'s expo-sure to her culture and traditions as she grows older \\nand might begin to question her identity. \\n \\nC. Openness in Adopti on Benefits Indian \\nChildren. \\n The story of Sam, Aubrey and M.E. illustrates the \\nimportance of openness in adoption, particularly for \\nIndian children. It is crucial for adopted children to \\nhave access to their birth re latives, and thus to their \\nbirth family and cultural histories. Equipped with \\nthis knowledge, children can begin to understand  \\nthe reasons leading to their  adoption and to answer \\nfundamental questions such as \\\"Who am I?\\\"; \\\"Where \\ndo I come from?\\\"; \\\"Why do I look the way I do?\\\"; \\n\\\"What is family?\\\"; and \\\"Do I have other brothers or \\nsisters?\\\" Open adoption also gives these children ac-\\ncess to important medical, genealogical, and cultural \\ninformation. Without this knowledge, many adoptive \\n15 \\n children struggle with ongoing uncertainty and have \\nno way to answer these fundamental identity ques-\\ntions. \\n These potential harms are particularly significant \\nfor Indian children. There is an extensive history of \\nactive erasure of Indian identity through boarding schools and other policies aimed at disrupting Indian \\nfamilies.\\n15 See 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1902 (a cknowledging the \\nimportance of the \\\"unique values of Indian culture\\\"). The ICWA's stated goal is therefore \\\"to protect the best \\ninterests of Indian children,\\\" in part by keeping Indian \\nchildren connected to their Tribes. Id. \\n Moreover, historical policies of separating children \\nfrom parents have resulted in increased detrimental impacts on Indian children and families. See Missis-\\nsippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield , 490 U.S. \\n30, 49\\u201350 (1989) (\\\"Congress' concern over the place-\\nment of Indian children in non-Indian homes was \\nbased in part on evidence of the detrimental impact on \\nthe children themselves of such placements outside their culture.\\\"). Child development scholars have long \\nrecognized that adolescent crime, drug abuse, alcohol-\\nism, and suicide are more pervasive for an Indian child \\n \\n 15 See generally  Brief of Amici Curiae  Historian Organiza-\\ntions in Support of Respondent \\u00a7 II, Haaland et al. v.

Topper, Drinking Patterns, Culture Change, \\nSociability, and Navajo Adolescents , 1 A\\nDDICTIVE  DIS-\\nEASES : AN INT'L J. 97 (1974)). Allowing openness in \\nadoption mitigates these impacts by keeping Indian \\nchildren connected to their communities. \\n The ICWA also serves to keep Indian children cul-\\nturally and politically connected to their Tribes and offers many advantages that come with tribal citizen-\\nship. E.g., Samuelson , 2007 WL 6900788, at 2 (\\\"Tribal \\nmembership completes the circle for the member's physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects of \\nhuman life.\\\"). These political  advantages can include \\naccess to medical and dental  services, per capita funds \\n(which Tribes often keep in trust for a child until they \\nturn eighteen), tribal housing, and scholarships for ed-\\nucation, to name just a few.\\n16 When Indian children \\n \\n 16 Like the political advantages of being a state citizen, such \\nas eligibility for in-state college tuition and varying health care benefits, or the advantages of United States citizenship, such as certain protections while traveling abroad including access to U.S. embassies and bargained-for release if ever detained by a \\nforeign government, tribal govern ments also provide political ad-\\nvantages to tribal members. See generally  Brief of Indian Tribes \\nand Tribal and Indian Organizations as Amici Curiae in Support \\n \\n17 \\n remain connected to their Tribes they are afforded the \\nopportunity to embrace their long-standing cultural \\ninheritance by participating in important tribal mile-\\nstones such as a first laugh ceremony, puberty rites, and tribal naming and healing ceremonies. For in-\\nstance, maintaining a connection with her Navajo \\ncustoms and traditions gives M.E. the opportunity to learn how to care for her hair and tie a traditional \\ntsiiy\\u00e9\\u00e9l  (hair bun), have a kinaald\\u00e1  (a female coming \\nof age ceremony), and learn  the importance of weaving \\nand other arts to the Navajo. Although M.E. was not \\nable to have her own, a connection to her Navajo cul-\\nture and community would also give M.E. the oppor-tunity to ensure her own children celebrate an aw\\u00e9\\u00e9' \\nch'ideeldloh  (first laugh ceremony). The ICWA pro-\\nvides a connection between an Indian child and her Tribe, so that even if a non-Indian family adopts her, \\nshe has a much easier road  on which to build connec-\\ntions to heritage, genealogy, medical history, and cus-toms. Indian children should be given the opportunity \\nto know and embrace their tribal political identities. \\n Further, unlike state citizenship requirements, \\ntribal citizenship status can be established, and the ad-\\nvantages of membership can be received, regardless of \\nwhere an Indian child is located. Tribal political mem-\\nbership is not entirely based on \\\"outmoded geograph-\\nical concepts of presence or domicile,\\\" In re  Appeal in \\nPima County Juvenile Action No.  S-903 , 130 Ariz. 202, \\n204, 635 P.2d 187, 189 (App. 1981), in part because \\n \\nof Deb Haaland et al., \\u00a7 II(A)(1), Haaland et al. v. Brackeen et al., \\nNo. 21-376 (discussing the importance of tribal membership). \\n18 \\n Tribes have the right to determine their own member-\\nship eligibility, see United States v. Wheeler , 435 U.S. \\n313, 322 n.18 (1978) (\\\"[U]nless limited by treaty or \\nstatute, a Tribe has the power to determine Tribe membership.\\\"). The ICWA protects individuals' rights \\nto tribal membership and provides Indian children \\nwho are at least eligible fo r enrollment with an oppor-\\ntunity to know who they ar e, where they come from, \\nand to participate in their tribal communities at any \\ntime. See 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1903(4).\\n17 \\n \\nII. THE ICWA DOES NOT PREVENT NON- \\nINDIANS FROM ADOPTING OR FOSTERING \\nINDIAN CHILDREN. \\n Non-Indians regularly fo ster or adopt Indian chil-\\ndren. Aubrey and Sam are direct evidence of this. The Individual Plaintiffs further affirm this fact: Chad and \\nJennifer Brackeen adopted a Navajo child and enrolled \\nmember, A.L.M., over three years ago in January of 2018. See Petitioner State of Texas Appendix to the \\nPetition for Writ of Certiorar i, Brackeen v. Haaland at \\n48a. On December 19, 2018, Nick and Heather Libretti \\nadopted Baby O., a child who is a member of the  \\nYsleta del Sur Pueblo. Id. at 49a. The only Individual \\n \\n 17 In other areas, the ICWA expressly incorporates a Tribe's \\nexercise of inherent sovereignty over its Indian children by recog-\\nnizing a Tribe's placement preferences. See 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1915(c) \\n(providing that an Indian child's Tribe may establish a different order of placement preference); Id. \\u00a7 1911(d) (giving full faith and \\ncredit to Indian legal resources related to Indian child custody \\nproceedings). \\n19 \\n Plaintiffs who did not adopt an Indian child are foster \\nparents Jason and Danielle Clifford. Id. at 50a. In-\\nstead, that child was moved to the home of her mater-\\nnal grandmother. Amicus Curiae  Robyn Bradshaw, \\nSection D, Statement of the Case and \\\"Bradshaw Ap-\\npendix,\\\" at 58a, 60a. \\n These examples are not anomalies because these \\nplacements are a product of the ICWA's structure, \\nwhich explicitly allows fo r placement of Indian chil-\\ndren with non-Indian families  in many circumstances \\nand in other situations, the ICWA does not exclude \\nnon-Indian placement. Furthermore, the ICWA place-ment preferences are not unique because nearly all \\nstates have laws similar to the ICWA's preference for \\nextended family. Lastly, the good cause exception facil-itates the protection of Indian children's best interests \\nin specific cases. \\n \\nA. The ICWA does not exclude non-Indians \\nfrom placement. \\n The ICWA placement preferences value an Indian \\nchild's relationships\\u2014which may lead to placement \\npreference with a non-Indian family or home. For ex-\\nample, the first placement preferences for foster care, pre-adoptive and adoptive placement preferences un-\\nder the ICWA are for \\\"extended family.\\\" 25 U.S.C. \\n\\u00a7 1915(a)(1) & (b)(i). Extended family includes non-Indians and under the ICWA, courts have placed In-\\ndian children with a non-Indian relative over an In-\\ndian foster home. See, e.g., In re D.L. , 2013 OK CIV APP \\n20 \\n 30, \\u00b6 9, 298 P.3d 1203, 1206 (upholding placement with \\nnon-Indian extended family member over placement \\nwith tribal foster home and ex plaining \\\"[a]lthough it is \\ntrue that a purpose of ICWA is preservation of the In-dian Tribe, the language of the Act demonstrates that \\nthe placement preference is for the child's extended \\nfamily over other members of the child's Tribe, with no requirement that the extended family be members of \\nthe child's Tribe.\\\"); In re Guardianship of Q.G.M. , 1991 \\nOK 29, \\u00b6 7, 808 P.2d 684, 691 (Simms, J., dissenting) (\\\"The [ICWA] does not give Indian relatives priority \\nover non-Indian relatives with regard to placement of \\ncustody of Indian children.\\\"). \\n The other ICWA placement preferences do not ex-\\npressly exclude non-Indians and often include them. Courts should follow this descending order of prefer-\\nence: (1) extended family; (2) a foster home, licensed, \\napproved or specified by the Indian child's Tribe; (3) an Indian foster home licensed or approved by an author-\\nized non-Indian licensing authority; or (4) an institu-\\ntion for children approved by an Indian Tribe or operated by an Indian organization. Notably, prefer-\\nences 1, 2, and 4 do not require that the placement be \\nIndian. For example, a foster home \\\"approved\\\" by the Tribe could be a non-Indian home that the Tribe pre-\\nfers, and an institution \\\"approved\\\" by the Tribe could \\nbe a county group home. Therefore, many ICWA ap-\\npropriate placements incl ude placements with non-\\nIndians. Even this Court has recognized that the \\nplacement preferences do not prohibit adoption by non-Indians. See Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl , 570 U.S. \\n21 \\n 637, 642 (2013) (Alito, J.) (\\\"clarify[ing] that \\u00a7 1915(a), \\nwhich provides placement preferences for the adop-\\ntion of Indian children, does not bar a non-Indian \\nfamily like Adoptive Couple from adopting an Indian child. . . .\\\"). \\n \\nB. Nearly All States Have Laws Similar \\nto the ICWA's Preferen ce for Extended \\nFamily. \\n Today, nearly all States have statutes that give \\nplacement preference in child  custody proceedings to \\nrelatives, including Texas.\\n18 In Texas, the state child \\nwelfare agency will place a ch ild with a relative or a \\ndesignated caregiver, including a child's preferred \\nplacement from his or her community.19 If a relative or \\ndesignated caregiver is not appropriate or available, the state agency will consider a previous foster place-\\nment.\\n20 In determining whether a placement is con-\\nsistent with the best interest of a child, Texas prefers \\\"[p]lacement with a relative or other person with \\nwhom the child has a long-standing and significant re-\\nlationship . . . over placem ent with a non-related care-\\ngiver.\\\" 40 Tex. Admin. Co de \\u00a7 700.1309(2). Further, in \\nTexas, the law generally presumes that it is in any \\n \\n 18 See The Indian Child Welfare Act: The Gold Standard of \\nChild Welfare Practice Brief , PARTNERS  FOR OUR CHILDREN  (Feb. \\n2019), https://partnersforourchildren .org/sites/default /files/ICWA%20 \\nBRIEF%20final.pdf. \\n 19 Tex.

Code \\u00a7 262.114(c). \\n22 \\n child's best interest to be placed with a family member \\nfirst, and then with individuals with a significant rela-\\ntionship to the child, before  considering any other out-\\nof-home placement. \\n Other states have similar preferences, including \\nformer parties to this litigation: Louisiana and Indi-ana. See, e.g., LSA-Ch.C. Art. 622; Ind. Code \\u00a7\\u00a7 31-34-\\n4-2 & 31-9-2-107 (defining \\\"relative\\\"); Ariz. R. P. Juv. \\nCt. 320; Ariz. Rev. Stat. \\u00a7 8-514 (the State \\\"shall place \\na child in the least restrictive type of placement avail-\\nable, consistent with the best interests of the child\\\" in \\nthe following order: \\\"1. With a parent. 2. With a grand-parent. 3. In kinship care with another member of the \\nchild's extended family, including a person who has a \\nsignificant relationship with the child . . . 4. In licensed family foster care. . . .\\\"). \\n This general placement preference hierarchy is \\nsubstantially similar to the ICWA's placement prefer-\\nences, which prefers placement first with a family \\nmember. Indeed, the ICWA and state child welfare \\nlaws both seek to preserve  and promote family integ-\\nrity and relative placement in the best interest of chil-\\ndren\\u2013\\u2013Indian and non-Indian alike. By preserving and promoting continued connection to family, culture, and \\ncommunity, the ICWA's protections lessen the trauma \\nintrinsic to child custody proceedings and of any nec-\\nessary removal.\\n21 \\n \\n 21 See Holyfield , 490 U.S. at 50  (stating that the ICWA aims \\nto reduce the \\\"damaging social and psychological impact\\\" Indian  \\n23 \\n  In addition, moving a foster child from a foster \\nhome to a relative for permanent placement is not un-\\nusual in a child welfare case , nor is it unique to the \\nICWA context. In fact, Federal Foster Care Programs under Title VI-E of the Social Security Act must con-\\nsider giving preference to relative placements,\\n22 and as \\nof 2018, 48 states, the Distri ct of Columbia, Guam, and \\nPuerto Rico have relative specific language in their \\nstatutes. The ICWA placement preference for extended \\nfamily is therefore very much like other federal and state laws. \\n \\nC. The Good Cause Exception Facilitates \\nthe Protection of Indian Children's Best Interests in Specific Cases. \\n Even in the limited instances where an Indian \\nhome is preferred over a non-Indian home, exceptions \\nhave been written into the ICWA that effectively bal-\\nance the child's best interests. Under the ICWA, for adoption, foster care, and pre-adoptive placements, a \\n \\nchildren suffer from removal from their families and culture) \\n(quoting S. Rep. No. 95-597 (1977)). \\n 22 See 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 671(a)(19) (requiring states to \\\"consider \\ngiving preference to an adult relative over a nonrelated caregiver when determining a placement for a child, provided that the rel-\\native caregiver meets all relevant state child protection stand-ards\\\" to receive federal funds). See also  Placement of Children \\nwith Relatives , C\\nHILD  WELFARE  INFORMATION  GATEWAY  1 (Jan. \\n2018), https://www.childwelfare.gov /pubPDFs/placement.pdf (\\\"When \\na child is removed from the home and placed in out-of-home care, relatives are the preferred resource because this placement type maintains the child's connections with his or her family.\\\"). \\n24 \\n state court can deviate fr om the ICWA placement pref-\\nerences for \\\"good cause.\\\" 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1915(a), (b). Good \\ncause could be the preference of a parent, as was the \\ncase with Aubrey and Sam where Tina chose to place \\nM.E. with them; the preferenc e of a child if old enough; \\nthe extraordinary emotional or physical needs of the \\nchild or any number of factors held to be good cause by the courts. See id.; see also  25 C.F.R. \\u00a7 23.132(c)(1)-(5). \\nCf. Guidelines for Implementing the Indian Child Wel-\\nfare Act \\u00a7 H.4, B\\nUREAU  OF INDIAN  AFFAIRS  (Dec. 2016), \\nhttps://www.bia.gov/sites/defa ult/files/dup/assets/bia/ \\nois/pdf/idc2-056831.pdf ( BIA Guidelines) (\\\"The rule's \\nlist of [good cause factor s] is not exhaustive.\\\"). \\n As noted in the legislative history of the ICWA, the \\ngood cause exception was \\\"designed to provide state courts flexibility in determining the disposition of a \\nplacement proceeding involving an Indian child.\\\" S. \\nRep. No. 95-587, at 17 (1977). These good cause factors give courts plenty of tools to fashion appropriate place-\\nments for Indian children and do not dictate the out-\\ncome of where an Indian child  will be placed. Indeed, \\nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs recognizes that the good \\ncause exceptions give state \\\"courts and agencies\\\" \\\"ulti-\\nmate authority\\\" and \\\"discretion . . . to consider any unique needs of a particular Indian child in making a \\ngood cause determination.\\\" BIA Guidelines \\u00a7 H.4. \\n And the good cause exception works. In the case of \\nAubrey and Sam, Tina's preference\\u2014based on no di-\\nrect contact with Aubrey and Sam\\u2014was sufficient good cause to have M.E. adopte d by a non-Indian couple. \\nEach year, state courts analyze this important issue \\n25 \\n and affirm placements with non-relative, non-Indian \\nfamilies under the good cause exception.

Aubrey and Sam decided to adopt because they wanted to grow their family, share their love with \\na child who needed a home, and  give their first child a \\nsibling while Aubrey was recovering from complica-tions attributable to birth injuries. Their adoption at-\\ntorney referred them to an agency in Arizona, which \\nconnected them with a bi rthmother named \\\"Tina.\\\"\\n2 \\nAubrey and Sam were overjoyed that Tina chose them \\nbut were confused about pressure from the adoption \\nattorneys involved to keep the adoption closed to any \\ncontact with M.E.'s Tribes. Aubrey and Sam strongly \\nbelieve in the importance of open adoptions because \\nopenness confers many long-term benefits on all par-ties\\u2014adoptive parents, birth parents, and children, \\nIndian and non-Indian alike. \\n Aubrey and Sam support the Indian Child Wel-\\nfare Act (the ICWA), including the placement prefer-\\nences, because it promotes open adoptions for Indian \\n \\n 1 All parties have consented to the filing of this brief. No \\ncounsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part, and no counsel or party made a monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation or submission of this brief. No person other than Amicus Curiae , its members, or its coun sel made a monetary con-\\ntribution to its preparation or submission. \\n \\n2 To protect the birth mother's privacy, Amicus Curiae  refer \\nto her by a pseudonym. In addition, although some birth mothers prefer other language, such as \\\"first mother,\\\" Amicus Curiae  use \\n\\\"birth mother\\\" or \\\"birth pare nt\\\" because those terms are com-\\nmonly used in adoption literature. \\n2 \\n children, and they believe keeping M.E. connected to \\nher time-honored tribal customs and traditions is in \\nher best interests. Had a member of M.E.'s family been \\navailable to adopt her, Aubrey and Sam would have supported such a placement because they believe it is \\nimportant to keep families together when possible and \\nbelieve that familial placement would have kept M.E. directly connected with her tribal community. It is be-\\ncause Aubrey and Sam love their daughter so fiercely \\nand believe that M.E. has a right to know her Tribes, her culture, and her extended family, that they submit \\nthis brief in support of the ICWA. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nINTRODUCTION AND \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\n The benefits of adoption are well established. \\nAdoption allows birth parents to give their children a \\nfamily when they are unable to provide one; adoptive \\nparents can start or grow a family and raise happy, \\nhealthy children; and adoption gives children the gift \\nof a loving, supportive home. The ICWA's procedural and substantive requirements increase the benefits of \\nadoptions by creating a platform for openness in adop-\\ntions and a conduit to Tribal identity. \\n Openness in adoptions reflects the understanding \\nthat communication between birth parents, adoptive parents, and children confers distinct and important \\nadvantages to all parties. Op enness in adoption bene-\\nfits all parties by giving access to vital information \\n3 \\n such as medical and genetic hi story. It also allows chil-\\ndren to maintain important connections to culture and \\nextended family. Open adoptions are particularly im-\\nportant for Indian children because openness allows Indian children to maintain political ties to their In-\\ndian Tribes and receive the ad vantages that come with \\ntribal membership. Without the ICWA's substantive and procedural bulwarks it is too easy for Indian chil-\\ndren to lose essential connection to their Tribal iden-\\ntity. \\n In addition to cultivating a landscape of openness, \\nthe ICWA allows, and sometimes gives greater prefer-ence to, non-Indians seeking to adopt or foster Indian \\nchildren, as demonstrated by Aubrey and Sam's and \\nthe Individual Plaintiffs' stories of successful adoption. And these stories are not unique. Indian children are \\nadopted or fostered by non-Indian families every year. \\nEven if the ICWA prohibited adoption or fostering by non-Indians, which it does  not, there simply are not \\nenough Indian homes for Indian children. Non-Indian \\nfamilies are therefore needed to give Indian children loving homes. \\n Moreover, the first preference under the ICWA for \\nadoption or foster care is placement with extended \\nfamily, a category that includes both Indians and non-\\nIndians because the ICWA does not differentiate be-tween the two when it discusses family. The ICWA's \\npreference for placement with extended family is con-\\nsistent with numerous state laws that give preference to extended family placements. Additionally, when \\nmultiple placement options are available, the \\\"good \\n4 \\n cause\\\" exception to the ICWA's placement preferences \\nallows courts to balance the best interests of the Indian \\nchild against other factors that may warrant place-\\nment outside of the preferences. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nARGUMENT \\nI. OPENNESS IN AD OPTION AND CONNEC-\\nTION TO FAMILIES AND TRIBES IS IN \\nTHE BEST INTEREST  OF CHILDREN. \\n The ICWA serves as a crucial tool for openness in \\nadoptions because it informs Indian children of their identity and heritage. Without the ICWA's conduit \\nconnecting Indian children to their Tribes, many adop-\\ntions, such as the one Aubrey and Sam experienced, are shrouded in secrecy, a pro cess which only serves to \\nhurt children, birth parents, and adoptive parents. The \\nICWA gives Tribes the tools necessary to participate in placement proceedings to ensure that Indian children \\nremain connected and aware of their customs and tra-\\nditions. See, e.g., 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1912(a) (providing notice \\nrequirements so that Tribes are informed when Indian \\nchildren are in involuntary placement proceedings).\\n3 \\n \\n 3 The requirement of notice under 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1912(a) does \\nnot apply to voluntary adoption proceedings such as Aubrey \\nand Sam's. However, providing notice to Tribes in voluntary pro-ceedings fosters openness and se veral states have enacted no-\\ntice requirements that also apply to voluntary proceedings. \\nSee, e.g., Iowa Code Ann. \\u00a7 232B.5(8) (2022) (providing notice to \\nTribes in voluntary proceedings); Minn. Stat. Ann. \\u00a7 260.761(3) (2021) (providing notice to Tribes in voluntary adoptive and pre-adoptive proceedings); 10 Okla. Stat. Ann. \\u00a7 10-40.4 (2022) (providing \\n \\n5 \\n The ICWA therefore fosters a culture of openness in \\nadoption that leads to many positive outcomes from \\nopen adoptions and a connection to one's familial and \\ncultural identity. \\n \\nA. Openness in Adoption. \\n For much of the 20th century, adoptions were se-\\ncretive affairs where parents did not tell their children that they were adopted or who their birth parents \\nwere. See Deborah H. Siegel & Susan Livingston \\nSmith, Openness in Adoption from Secrecy and Stigma \\nto Knowledge and Connections , Evan B. Donaldson \\nAdoption Institute at 5 (M ar. 2012). Closed adoptions\\u2014\\nwhere there is little to no contact between children and \\ntheir birth parents\\u2014reflect societal attitudes from the \\nearly and mid-20th century, when parents and state \\nlegislatures sought to protect adopted children from the stigma of illegitimacy, misplaced fear that birth \\nparents would eventually \\\"take back\\\" the child, and \\nthe mistaken belief that adopted children could simply\\u2014and without question\\u2014assume their adoptive \\nparents' family history and culture. Secrecy and confi-\\ndentiality, despite the adoptive parents' best intentions and efforts, often led to adopted adolescents having un-\\nresolved identity questions concerning their family \\nhistory and the reason for their adoption. \\n \\nnotice to Tribes in voluntary proceedings); N.M. Stat. Ann. \\n\\u00a7 32A-28-2 (defining child custody proceeding to include adoptive placement) and \\u00a7 32A-28-5 (requiri ng notice for all child custody \\nproceedings). \\n6 \\n  Societal attitudes shifted slowly towards some \\nform of open adoptions\\u2014in which children are aware \\nwho their birth parents are and have varying degrees \\nof contact with them\\u2014or some form of mediated adop-tion\\u2014in which the adoption agency facilitates some \\nform of regular contact between birth parents and \\ntheir children.\\n4 In 1997, for instance, only 16% of re-\\nspondents to a national survey by the Evan B. Don-\\naldson Adoption Institute approved of birth mothers \\nsending cards or letters to adoptive families, with the majority of respondents saying it was only acceptable \\nin some or very few cases.\\n5 The last few decades, how-\\never, have seen a paradigmat ic shift\\u2014so much so that, \\nas of 2012, closed adoptions represented only about 5% \\nof placements, whereas 55% of placements were fully \\ndisclosed, and 40% were mediated.6 \\n The shift toward openness is an important devel-\\nopment that reflects the now-widespread understand-ing that secrecy in adoptions has a negative impact on \\nadopted children, birth parents, and adoptive parents. \\nOpen adoptions come with many benefits including measurably increased satisfaction and peace of mind \\n \\n 4 Amicus Curiae  recognize that open adoptions may not be \\npossible in some cases, such as international adoption, or may not \\nbe advisable in some cases, such as if severe abuse was involved. \\n 5 See Deborah H.

This type of \\ninformation facilitates identity formation, as well as \\npositive feelings toward their birth parents and others. Further, open adoptions help children cope with the \\nuncertainty and the ambiguous sense of loss that come \\nfrom \\\"losing\\\" birth parents, because openness gives children a link to their b iological families and commu-\\nnity.\\n11 In addition, children in open adoptions reported \\nhigher self-esteem, their parents rated them lower in behavioral problems, and th eir families reported more \\ntrust for their parents, fewe r feelings of alienation and \\nbetter overall family functioning.\\n12 \\n \\nB.

Their New Hampshire attorney worked with a lawyer in Arizona and an agency, Arizona Adoption \\nHelp, to locate potential birth mothers. \\n After completing their paperwork, Aubrey and \\nSam began receiving emails from Arizona Adoption \\nHelp about potential birth mothers and potential adop-\\ntive children. If they were \\\"interested\\\" in the child, the \\nadoption agency instructed them to indicate their in-\\nterest, at which point the agency would \\\"share\\\" their \\nprofile with the birth mother. For each of these profiles, \\nthe adoption agency estimate d the cost of the adoption, \\nwhich typically was $30,000 for the Arizona attorney (which included birth parent  living expenses), $2,500 \\nfor a counselor hired by the adoption agency (who, in \\nAubrey and Sam's case, also served as the notary on the adoption paperwork), and $14,000 for the New \\nHampshire attorney. The cost to adopt would therefore \\nrange from $40,000 to $50,000, and adoption was not guaranteed. The costs for ea ch adoption were mostly \\nthe same, but with added complication and cost for \\nadopting an Indian child. Sam and Aubrey were later informed that this was due to the need to comply with \\nthe ICWA, but aside from hiring another attorney at \\nan extra cost and a longer stay in Arizona in order  to \\\"deal with ICWA,\\\" no other details were readily \\n10 \\n provided about what was required to comply. This was \\nsomewhat perplexing to Sam and Aubrey because the \\nadoption agency also strongly discouraged any commu-\\nnication with an Indian child's Tribe. \\n A birth mother named Tina living in Phoenix, Ar-\\nizona, ultimately selected Aubrey and Sam as adoptive parents. Tina reported that her great grandmother \\nwas Cherokee. The alleged father of the baby girl was \\na Navajo tribal member but was not involved in the adoption or in a relationship with Tina, and he never \\nestablished paternity. Neither the Cherokee nor the \\nNavajo Nations were involved in the adoption, and Tina's adoption attorney from Arizona Adoption Help \\nadvised Aubrey and Sam that, due to the Indian ances-\\ntry involved, \\\"the safest course would be for your cli-ents to retain [another attorney] to represent birth \\nparents in taking ICWA consents.\\\" The lawyers in the \\ncase also strongly discouraged any contact with Tina during the process. Aubrey and Sam were thrilled that \\nTina chose them but were co nfused about the secrecy \\nsurrounding M.E.'s tribal status. \\n Tina gave birth to a baby girl on September 11, \\n2020, in Phoenix, Arizona. Almost immediately, the baby girl was placed with Sam and Aubrey, and they \\nnamed her M.E. Twelve days later, the mother's attor-\\nney filed a consent to voluntary termination of paren-tal rights on behalf of Tina in the Coconino County \\nSuperior Court in Flagstaff, Arizona, a court over 150 \\nmiles from Tina's residence. In Arizona, an adoption petition should be filed in the court of the county where \\n11 \\n the prospective adoptive parent resides,13 and no party \\nto the case resided in Coconino County. Aubrey and \\nSam were later informed by mother's attorney that Co-\\nconino County was a better forum for ICWA cases. Au-brey and Sam believe the forum was chosen to prevent \\nany tribal involvement. \\n Fourteen days after M.E. was born, the Judge in \\nCoconino County issued an Order terminating the pa-\\nrental rights of Tina. The Judge held that although the ICWA applied to M.E., there was \\\"good cause\\\" to devi-\\nate from the placement preferences based on the Tina's \\nrequest to deviate from the preferences,\\n14 and placed \\nthe child with Aubrey and Sam. Again, although they \\nwere happy that the Court pl aced M.E. with them, they \\nhad concerns that Tina was not fully informed about ICWA or her options. This concern arose because the \\nattorneys involved only pe rmitted limited contact with \\nTina, especially before M.E.'s birth. The attorneys told Aubrey and Sam they should not ask Tina about M.E.'s \\nheritage and the attorneys themselves ignored Sam \\nand Aubrey's request that they obtain and share de-tails about M.E.'s Cherokee heritage. Aubrey and Sam \\nwere also prevented from discussing other adoption de-\\ntails with Tina, including her preferences about con-tacting M.E.'s Tribes. Although Aubrey and Sam now \\n \\n 13 See Ariz. Rev. Stat. \\u00a7 8-104 (providing that venue for adop-\\ntion proceedings is appropriate \\\"in the county where the prospec-tive adoptive parent resides or, if applicable, in the county where the child is a ward\\\"). \\n \\n14 Good cause may be based on the preference of the parent. \\nSee 25 C.F.R. \\u00a7 23.132(c)(1). \\n12 \\n exchange messages with Tina regarding M.E., Aubrey \\nand Sam still do not underst and why the adoption was \\nshrouded in secrecy when Aubrey, Sam and Tina's \\ngoals were M.E.'s best interests, which necessarily in-cludes open communication about M.E.'s tribal mem-\\nbership and heritage. \\n The attorneys involved in M.E.'s adoption also \\nasked Aubrey and Sam to submit written verification \\nthat they would not enroll M.E. or have any contact \\nwith the Navajo or Cherokee Nations for at least five \\nyears. Although they felt pressured to sign the docu-\\nment, they declined. Aubrey and Sam want their daughter, M.E., to know where she comes from, and \\nthey believe that it is in her best interest to have a con-\\nnection to her Tribes, because of the importance of fam-ily history, access to ho nored Tribal customs and \\ntraditions, and political membership. See, e.g., Samuel-\\nson v. Little River Band of Ottawa Indians-Enrollment Comm'n , 06-113-AP, 2007 WL 6900788, at 2 (Little \\nRiver Ct. App. 2007) (\\\"Tribal membership for Indian \\npeople . . . is the essence of one's identity, belonging to \\ncommunity, connection to one's heritage and an affir-\\nmation of their human being place in this life and \\nworld.\\\"). Had things been different\\u2014for instance if M.E.'s family, such as an aunt, uncle or grandparent, \\nor other extended family, were available to adopt \\nM.E.\\u2014Aubrey and Sam would have supported appli-cation of the placement preferences and not sought to \\ndeviate under a good cause exception. They support \\nkeeping children with their families when possible, es-pecially if that means that a child retains a close \\n13 \\n connection with their family, Tribe, and community. In \\naddition, during the adoption Aubrey and Sam were \\naware that the ICWA did not require them to keep \\nM.E.'s adoption a secret or refrain from contacting the Navajo or the Cherokee Nations. To the contrary, Au-\\nbrey and Sam believe the ICWA encourages connection \\nbetween Indian children and their Tribes and deter-mines that these relationship s are in their best inter-\\nests. \\n Aubrey and Sam believe that the private adoption \\nindustry, or at least some of  its participants, purposely \\nobfuscate the ICWA's requirements and unnecessarily push adoptive parents towards closed adoptions, re-\\ngardless of an adoptive parents' wishes, in order to \\nkeep Indian children like M.E. separated from their Tribes. In the end, these se cretive practices only serve \\nto hurt children and prospecti ve adoptive families and \\nimpede the ICWA's procedural requirements that fa-cilitate openness in adoption. Aubrey and Sam's prior-\\nity is M.E.'s well-being, and they understand that the \\nICWA serves M.E.'s best interests by establishing a connection with her tribal community and by ensuring \\nthat M.E. is placed in a loving and caring home. \\n For instance, Aubrey and Sam only learned about \\naw\\u00e9\\u00e9' ch'ideeldloh  (first laugh ceremony)\\u2013\\u2013a tradi-\\ntional Navajo celebration that marks a baby's progres-sion toward a healthy life and  is customarily organized \\nby the person who made a ne w baby laugh for the first \\ntime\\u2013\\u2013nearly a year after it would have been appropri-ate to hold this gathering. This is just one early missed \\nopportunity to connect M.E. and the rest of her family \\n14 \\n to her heritage, and an example of why many children \\nin closed adoptions struggle to form strong identities. \\nDespite missing this important Navajo tradition, Au-\\nbrey and Sam have taken steps to open the adoption. For instance, they remain in touch with Tina, and pro-\\nvide her with updates about M.E. Tina has expressed \\nher hopes for M.E. and h elped connect Aubrey and \\nSam to the putative father. Sam and Aubrey also wrote \\nto one of M.E.'s Tribes and  asked for information on \\nhow they might establish a relationship with an indi-vidual willing to serve as a cultural mentor for their \\nfamily. The information Sam and Aubrey have learned \\nhas been helpful in planning to support M.E.'s expo-sure to her culture and traditions as she grows older \\nand might begin to question her identity. \\n \\nC. Openness in Adopti on Benefits Indian \\nChildren. \\n The story of Sam, Aubrey and M.E. illustrates the \\nimportance of openness in adoption, particularly for \\nIndian children. It is crucial for adopted children to \\nhave access to their birth re latives, and thus to their \\nbirth family and cultural histories. Equipped with \\nthis knowledge, children can begin to understand  \\nthe reasons leading to their  adoption and to answer \\nfundamental questions such as \\\"Who am I?\\\"; \\\"Where \\ndo I come from?\\\"; \\\"Why do I look the way I do?\\\"; \\n\\\"What is family?\\\"; and \\\"Do I have other brothers or \\nsisters?\\\" Open adoption also gives these children ac-\\ncess to important medical, genealogical, and cultural \\ninformation. Without this knowledge, many adoptive \\n15 \\n children struggle with ongoing uncertainty and have \\nno way to answer these fundamental identity ques-\\ntions. \\n These potential harms are particularly significant \\nfor Indian children. There is an extensive history of \\nactive erasure of Indian identity through boarding schools and other policies aimed at disrupting Indian \\nfamilies.\\n15 See 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1902 (a cknowledging the \\nimportance of the \\\"unique values of Indian culture\\\"). The ICWA's stated goal is therefore \\\"to protect the best \\ninterests of Indian children,\\\" in part by keeping Indian \\nchildren connected to their Tribes. Id. \\n Moreover, historical policies of separating children \\nfrom parents have resulted in increased detrimental impacts on Indian children and families. See Missis-\\nsippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield , 490 U.S. \\n30, 49\\u201350 (1989) (\\\"Congress' concern over the place-\\nment of Indian children in non-Indian homes was \\nbased in part on evidence of the detrimental impact on \\nthe children themselves of such placements outside their culture.\\\"). Child development scholars have long \\nrecognized that adolescent crime, drug abuse, alcohol-\\nism, and suicide are more pervasive for an Indian child \\n \\n 15 See generally  Brief of Amici Curiae  Historian Organiza-\\ntions in Support of Respondent \\u00a7 II, Haaland et al. v.

Topper, Drinking Patterns, Culture Change, \\nSociability, and Navajo Adolescents , 1 A\\nDDICTIVE  DIS-\\nEASES : AN INT'L J. 97 (1974)). Allowing openness in \\nadoption mitigates these impacts by keeping Indian \\nchildren connected to their communities. \\n The ICWA also serves to keep Indian children cul-\\nturally and politically connected to their Tribes and offers many advantages that come with tribal citizen-\\nship. E.g., Samuelson , 2007 WL 6900788, at 2 (\\\"Tribal \\nmembership completes the circle for the member's physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects of \\nhuman life.\\\"). These political  advantages can include \\naccess to medical and dental  services, per capita funds \\n(which Tribes often keep in trust for a child until they \\nturn eighteen), tribal housing, and scholarships for ed-\\nucation, to name just a few.\\n16 When Indian children \\n \\n 16 Like the political advantages of being a state citizen, such \\nas eligibility for in-state college tuition and varying health care benefits, or the advantages of United States citizenship, such as certain protections while traveling abroad including access to U.S. embassies and bargained-for release if ever detained by a \\nforeign government, tribal govern ments also provide political ad-\\nvantages to tribal members. See generally  Brief of Indian Tribes \\nand Tribal and Indian Organizations as Amici Curiae in Support \\n \\n17 \\n remain connected to their Tribes they are afforded the \\nopportunity to embrace their long-standing cultural \\ninheritance by participating in important tribal mile-\\nstones such as a first laugh ceremony, puberty rites, and tribal naming and healing ceremonies. For in-\\nstance, maintaining a connection with her Navajo \\ncustoms and traditions gives M.E. the opportunity to learn how to care for her hair and tie a traditional \\ntsiiy\\u00e9\\u00e9l  (hair bun), have a kinaald\\u00e1  (a female coming \\nof age ceremony), and learn  the importance of weaving \\nand other arts to the Navajo. Although M.E. was not \\nable to have her own, a connection to her Navajo cul-\\nture and community would also give M.E. the oppor-tunity to ensure her own children celebrate an aw\\u00e9\\u00e9' \\nch'ideeldloh  (first laugh ceremony). The ICWA pro-\\nvides a connection between an Indian child and her Tribe, so that even if a non-Indian family adopts her, \\nshe has a much easier road  on which to build connec-\\ntions to heritage, genealogy, medical history, and cus-toms. Indian children should be given the opportunity \\nto know and embrace their tribal political identities. \\n Further, unlike state citizenship requirements, \\ntribal citizenship status can be established, and the ad-\\nvantages of membership can be received, regardless of \\nwhere an Indian child is located. Tribal political mem-\\nbership is not entirely based on \\\"outmoded geograph-\\nical concepts of presence or domicile,\\\" In re  Appeal in \\nPima County Juvenile Action No.  S-903 , 130 Ariz. 202, \\n204, 635 P.2d 187, 189 (App. 1981), in part because \\n \\nof Deb Haaland et al., \\u00a7 II(A)(1), Haaland et al. v.

Wheeler , 435 U.S. \\n313, 322 n.18 (1978) (\\\"[U]nless limited by treaty or \\nstatute, a Tribe has the power to determine Tribe membership.\\\"). The ICWA protects individuals' rights \\nto tribal membership and provides Indian children \\nwho are at least eligible fo r enrollment with an oppor-\\ntunity to know who they ar e, where they come from, \\nand to participate in their tribal communities at any \\ntime. See 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1903(4).\\n17 \\n \\nII. THE ICWA DOES NOT PREVENT NON- \\nINDIANS FROM ADOPTING OR FOSTERING \\nINDIAN CHILDREN. \\n Non-Indians regularly fo ster or adopt Indian chil-\\ndren. Aubrey and Sam are direct evidence of this. The Individual Plaintiffs further affirm this fact: Chad and \\nJennifer Brackeen adopted a Navajo child and enrolled \\nmember, A.L.M., over three years ago in January of 2018. See Petitioner State of Texas Appendix to the \\nPetition for Writ of Certiorar i, Brackeen v. Haaland at \\n48a. On December 19, 2018, Nick and Heather Libretti \\nadopted Baby O., a child who is a member of the  \\nYsleta del Sur Pueblo. Id. at 49a. The only Individual \\n \\n 17 In other areas, the ICWA expressly incorporates a Tribe's \\nexercise of inherent sovereignty over its Indian children by recog-\\nnizing a Tribe's placement preferences. See 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1915(c) \\n(providing that an Indian child's Tribe may establish a different order of placement preference); Id. \\u00a7 1911(d) (giving full faith and \\ncredit to Indian legal resources related to Indian child custody \\nproceedings). \\n19 \\n Plaintiffs who did not adopt an Indian child are foster \\nparents Jason and Danielle Clifford. Id. at 50a. In-\\nstead, that child was moved to the home of her mater-\\nnal grandmother. Amicus Curiae  Robyn Bradshaw, \\nSection D, Statement of the Case and \\\"Bradshaw Ap-\\npendix,\\\" at 58a, 60a. \\n These examples are not anomalies because these \\nplacements are a product of the ICWA's structure, \\nwhich explicitly allows fo r placement of Indian chil-\\ndren with non-Indian families  in many circumstances \\nand in other situations, the ICWA does not exclude \\nnon-Indian placement. Furthermore, the ICWA place-ment preferences are not unique because nearly all \\nstates have laws similar to the ICWA's preference for \\nextended family. Lastly, the good cause exception facil-itates the protection of Indian children's best interests \\nin specific cases. \\n \\nA. The ICWA does not exclude non-Indians \\nfrom placement. \\n The ICWA placement preferences value an Indian \\nchild's relationships\\u2014which may lead to placement \\npreference with a non-Indian family or home. For ex-\\nample, the first placement preferences for foster care, pre-adoptive and adoptive placement preferences un-\\nder the ICWA are for \\\"extended family.\\\" 25 U.S.C. \\n\\u00a7 1915(a)(1) & (b)(i). Extended family includes non-Indians and under the ICWA, courts have placed In-\\ndian children with a non-Indian relative over an In-\\ndian foster home. See, e.g., In re D.L. , 2013 OK CIV APP \\n20 \\n 30, \\u00b6 9, 298 P.3d 1203, 1206 (upholding placement with \\nnon-Indian extended family member over placement \\nwith tribal foster home and ex plaining \\\"[a]lthough it is \\ntrue that a purpose of ICWA is preservation of the In-dian Tribe, the language of the Act demonstrates that \\nthe placement preference is for the child's extended \\nfamily over other members of the child's Tribe, with no requirement that the extended family be members of \\nthe child's Tribe.\\\"); In re Guardianship of Q.G.M. , 1991 \\nOK 29, \\u00b6 7, 808 P.2d 684, 691 (Simms, J., dissenting) (\\\"The [ICWA] does not give Indian relatives priority \\nover non-Indian relatives with regard to placement of \\ncustody of Indian children.\\\"). \\n The other ICWA placement preferences do not ex-\\npressly exclude non-Indians and often include them. Courts should follow this descending order of prefer-\\nence: (1) extended family; (2) a foster home, licensed, \\napproved or specified by the Indian child's Tribe; (3) an Indian foster home licensed or approved by an author-\\nized non-Indian licensing authority; or (4) an institu-\\ntion for children approved by an Indian Tribe or operated by an Indian organization. Notably, prefer-\\nences 1, 2, and 4 do not require that the placement be \\nIndian. For example, a foster home \\\"approved\\\" by the Tribe could be a non-Indian home that the Tribe pre-\\nfers, and an institution \\\"approved\\\" by the Tribe could \\nbe a county group home. Therefore, many ICWA ap-\\npropriate placements incl ude placements with non-\\nIndians. Even this Court has recognized that the \\nplacement preferences do not prohibit adoption by non-Indians. See Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl , 570 U.S. \\n21 \\n 637, 642 (2013) (Alito, J.) (\\\"clarify[ing] that \\u00a7 1915(a), \\nwhich provides placement preferences for the adop-\\ntion of Indian children, does not bar a non-Indian \\nfamily like Adoptive Couple from adopting an Indian child. . . .\\\"). \\n \\nB. Nearly All States Have Laws Similar \\nto the ICWA's Preferen ce for Extended \\nFamily. \\n Today, nearly all States have statutes that give \\nplacement preference in child  custody proceedings to \\nrelatives, including Texas.\\n18 In Texas, the state child \\nwelfare agency will place a ch ild with a relative or a \\ndesignated caregiver, including a child's preferred \\nplacement from his or her community.19 If a relative or \\ndesignated caregiver is not appropriate or available, the state agency will consider a previous foster place-\\nment.\\n20 In determining whether a placement is con-\\nsistent with the best interest of a child, Texas prefers \\\"[p]lacement with a relative or other person with \\nwhom the child has a long-standing and significant re-\\nlationship . . . over placem ent with a non-related care-\\ngiver.\\\" 40 Tex. Admin. Co de \\u00a7 700.1309(2). Further, in \\nTexas, the law generally presumes that it is in any \\n \\n 18 See The Indian Child Welfare Act: The Gold Standard of \\nChild Welfare Practice Brief , PARTNERS  FOR OUR CHILDREN  (Feb. \\n2019), https://partnersforourchildren .org/sites/default /files/ICWA%20 \\nBRIEF%20final.pdf. \\n 19 Tex.

Code \\u00a7 262.114(c). \\n22 \\n child's best interest to be placed with a family member \\nfirst, and then with individuals with a significant rela-\\ntionship to the child, before  considering any other out-\\nof-home placement. \\n Other states have similar preferences, including \\nformer parties to this litigation: Louisiana and Indi-ana. See, e.g., LSA-Ch.C. Art. 622; Ind. Code \\u00a7\\u00a7 31-34-\\n4-2 & 31-9-2-107 (defining \\\"relative\\\"); Ariz. R. P. Juv. \\nCt. 320; Ariz. Rev. Stat. \\u00a7 8-514 (the State \\\"shall place \\na child in the least restrictive type of placement avail-\\nable, consistent with the best interests of the child\\\" in \\nthe following order: \\\"1. With a parent. 2. With a grand-parent. 3. In kinship care with another member of the \\nchild's extended family, including a person who has a \\nsignificant relationship with the child . . . 4. In licensed family foster care. . . .\\\"). \\n This general placement preference hierarchy is \\nsubstantially similar to the ICWA's placement prefer-\\nences, which prefers placement first with a family \\nmember. Indeed, the ICWA and state child welfare \\nlaws both seek to preserve  and promote family integ-\\nrity and relative placement in the best interest of chil-\\ndren\\u2013\\u2013Indian and non-Indian alike. By preserving and promoting continued connection to family, culture, and \\ncommunity, the ICWA's protections lessen the trauma \\nintrinsic to child custody proceedings and of any nec-\\nessary removal.\\n21 \\n \\n 21 See Holyfield , 490 U.S. at 50  (stating that the ICWA aims \\nto reduce the \\\"damaging social and psychological impact\\\" Indian  \\n23 \\n  In addition, moving a foster child from a foster \\nhome to a relative for permanent placement is not un-\\nusual in a child welfare case , nor is it unique to the \\nICWA context. In fact, Federal Foster Care Programs under Title VI-E of the Social Security Act must con-\\nsider giving preference to relative placements,\\n22 and as \\nof 2018, 48 states, the Distri ct of Columbia, Guam, and \\nPuerto Rico have relative specific language in their \\nstatutes. The ICWA placement preference for extended \\nfamily is therefore very much like other federal and state laws. \\n \\nC. The Good Cause Exception Facilitates \\nthe Protection of Indian Children's Best Interests in Specific Cases. \\n Even in the limited instances where an Indian \\nhome is preferred over a non-Indian home, exceptions \\nhave been written into the ICWA that effectively bal-\\nance the child's best interests. Under the ICWA, for adoption, foster care, and pre-adoptive placements, a \\n \\nchildren suffer from removal from their families and culture) \\n(quoting S. Rep. No. 95-597 (1977)). \\n 22 See 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 671(a)(19) (requiring states to \\\"consider \\ngiving preference to an adult relative over a nonrelated caregiver when determining a placement for a child, provided that the rel-\\native caregiver meets all relevant state child protection stand-ards\\\" to receive federal funds). See also  Placement of Children \\nwith Relatives , C\\nHILD  WELFARE  INFORMATION  GATEWAY  1 (Jan. \\n2018), https://www.childwelfare.gov /pubPDFs/placement.pdf (\\\"When \\na child is removed from the home and placed in out-of-home care, relatives are the preferred resource because this placement type maintains the child's connections with his or her family.\\\"). \\n24 \\n state court can deviate fr om the ICWA placement pref-\\nerences for \\\"good cause.\\\" 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1915(a), (b). Good \\ncause could be the preference of a parent, as was the \\ncase with Aubrey and Sam where Tina chose to place \\nM.E. with them; the preferenc e of a child if old enough; \\nthe extraordinary emotional or physical needs of the \\nchild or any number of factors held to be good cause by the courts. See id.; see also  25 C.F.R. \\u00a7 23.132(c)(1)-(5). \\nCf. Guidelines for Implementing the Indian Child Wel-\\nfare Act \\u00a7 H.4, B\\nUREAU  OF INDIAN  AFFAIRS  (Dec. 2016), \\nhttps://www.bia.gov/sites/defa ult/files/dup/assets/bia/ \\nois/pdf/idc2-056831.pdf ( BIA Guidelines) (\\\"The rule's \\nlist of [good cause factor s] is not exhaustive.\\\"). \\n As noted in the legislative history of the ICWA, the \\ngood cause exception was \\\"designed to provide state courts flexibility in determining the disposition of a \\nplacement proceeding involving an Indian child.\\\" S. \\nRep. No. 95-587, at 17 (1977). These good cause factors give courts plenty of tools to fashion appropriate place-\\nments for Indian children and do not dictate the out-\\ncome of where an Indian child  will be placed. Indeed, \\nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs recognizes that the good \\ncause exceptions give state \\\"courts and agencies\\\" \\\"ulti-\\nmate authority\\\" and \\\"discretion . . . to consider any unique needs of a particular Indian child in making a \\ngood cause determination.\\\" BIA Guidelines \\u00a7 H.4. \\n And the good cause exception works. In the case of \\nAubrey and Sam, Tina's preference\\u2014based on no di-\\nrect contact with Aubrey and Sam\\u2014was sufficient good cause to have M.E. adopte d by a non-Indian couple. \\nEach year, state courts analyze this important issue \\n25 \\n and affirm placements with non-relative, non-Indian \\nfamilies under the good cause exception. In the last \\ntwo years alone, courts in Arizona, Minnesota, Ne-\\nbraska, and Utah have addressed placing Indian chil-dren and have, where appropriate, affirmed placement \\nwith non-relative, non-Indian families.
