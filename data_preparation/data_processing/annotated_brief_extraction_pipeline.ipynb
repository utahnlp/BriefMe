While debating the extent to \\nwhich the Constitution should enshrine protections for religious freedom during the First Congress, \\nRepresentative Daniel Carroll of Maryland\\u2014one of \\nthe few Catholics among the Constitution\\u2019s \\nFramers\\u2014remarked \\u201cthe rights of conscience are, in \\ntheir nature, of peculiar delicacy, and will little bear \\nthe gentlest touch of governmental hand.\\u201d 1 Annals \\nof Cong. 757-58 (Joseph Gales ed., 1834) (Aug. 15, 1789). \\nNowhere are the rights of the religious more \\ndelicate than when they intersect with the freedom \\nto put faith into action, belief into words. If the \\nrobust religious freedom protections guaranteed by \\nour Constitution are to have any meaning, they must \\nbe capable of shielding a sincere religious believer from being coerced into speaking against the core \\ntenants of her faith. To hold otherwise would be to \\npermit the heavy hand of government to extinguish \\nreligious practice. This the Constitution will not \\nallow. \\nThe Founders understood that the First \\nAmendment, as drafted, protected all religious sects in their right to speak freely in accordance with their \\nfaith. Indeed, the Founding Generation believed \\nprotections for religious lib erty to be of utmost \\nimport. Since its founding, America has been gripped \\n 3 \\nin debate over religious liberty. Even before the \\ncolonies declared their independence, there were \\nenergetic discussions over the bounds of religious \\ntoleration versus a full freedom to exercise religion \\n(with only limited exceptions). Ultimately, the \\nConstitution\\u2019s drafters settled on James Madison\\u2019s \\nview of an unalienable right to practice one\\u2019s \\nreligious faith. Owed to an understanding that the Governor of the Universe supersedes any earthly \\nauthority, religious convictions were understood to \\ncommand greater deference than mere personal \\nopinions. Where opinion was required to yield to the \\nlaw, tensions between law and religious belief often \\nresulted in exemption for the believer. \\nThe Founding Generation also viewed religious \\nliberty as encompassing more  than mere matters of \\nconscience or decisions on the rightness or wrongness \\nof acts. Instead, the full ex ercise of religion offered a \\nright to act in accordance with one\\u2019s faith and, \\nnecessarily, included protection from government \\ncompelled speech that violated a believer\\u2019s firmly \\nheld religious convictions. This distinction was \\nperhaps most clearly expressed in the early colonies\\u2019 \\nanti-Catholic prejudices. In colonial Georgia, for example, while all worshipers were vested by its \\nCharter with a liberty of conscience, Catholics were \\nexpressly excluded from protections for the more \\nrobust free exercise of religion. McConnell, The \\nOrigins and Historical Understanding of Free \\nExercise of Religion, 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1409, 1489-90 \\n(1989) (hereinafter McConnell, Origins). \\nInformed by the debates and experiences of their \\ntime, the Founders opted to include among the Constitution\\u2019s protections the more extensive free \\n 4 \\nexercise of religion. In so doing, they extended the \\nmaximum protections available to all who professed \\nbelief in a Universal Sovereign. These protections, it \\nwas understood, included a right to act out belief and \\nto speak, or refrain from speaking, freely, in \\naccordance with faith. \\nWith this understanding as background, it is \\nclear the First Amendment provides dual protections for religious expression (or non-expression) in its \\nguarantees of free speech and free religious exercise. \\nThis reality compels the conclusion that religious \\nspeech enjoys the highest constitutional protection. \\nCertainly, this is consistent with the Founders\\u2019 \\nunderstanding of robust religious liberty protections, \\nas revealed in the text, history, and tradition of the First Amendment. \\nThis Court\\u2019s recent religious liberty jurisprudence \\nconcurs with the Founders\\u2019 view of full-throated \\nreligious liberty protection. Religious observers have \\nwelcomed the relief from government oppression. No \\nlonger can religious believers be excluded solely \\nbecause of their religious identity. Free are the religious to express their religious views without fear \\nof government reprisal. This Court\\u2019s precedents have \\nbeen unequivocal: if government can achieve its \\nmeans without burdening religion, the Constitution \\nalmost always requires that it must. \\nAnother truism is derived from this Court\\u2019s \\nprecedents. When religious liberty concerns are coupled with free expression, the Constitution \\ndemands the most exacting scrutiny. That is because \\nthe First Amendment, as understood from the \\nFounding, provides special protection for the \\n 5 \\nreligious, their right to speak freely, and their right \\nto refrain from speaking. Distinct from pure \\ncommercial speech, religious speech demands a \\nhigher constitutional protection. That is why, to \\nAmicus Curiae\\u2019s knowledge, government compelled \\nreligious speech has never been held to survive strict \\nscrutiny. \\nAgainst this backdrop, the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s opinion \\ncannot stand. Although purporting to apply strict scrutiny, the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s analysis is rife with \\nflaws, each one fatal to the court\\u2019s conclusion. From \\nthe outset, the Tenth Circuit failed to recognize the \\npreferred status of Ms. Smith\\u2019s free speech rights, \\ngrounded as they are in her religious beliefs. This \\nfailure is only compounded by the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s lethargic narrow-tailoring analysis. Far from the \\nexacting analysis this Court requires, the Tenth \\nCircuit settles into a now familiar pattern to those of \\nfaith\\u2014ostracizing Ms. Smith from society because of \\nher religious identity. \\nOnce again, this Court must reverse yet another \\nassault on religious freedom by declaring that where, as here, free speech and religion intersect, \\nconstitutional protections are at their greatest. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 6 \\nARGUMENT \\nI. AS ORIGINALLY UNDERSTOOD , THE FIRST \\nAMENDMENT PROTECTED THE RIGHT OF THE \\nRELIGIOUS TO SPEAK AND TO REMAIN SILENT . \\nThe First Amendment is \\u201cunique in form among \\namendments to the Constitution.\\u201d2 It is drafted, not \\nas a grant of privileges or rights to the people, but as \\na disability on Congress\\u2019 ability to act. Report to the Attorney General, supra  note 2, at 15\\u201316. In its \\nentirety, the First Amendment reads: \\nCongress shall make no law respecting \\nan establishment of religion, or \\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; or \\nabridging the freedom of speech, or of \\nthe press; or the right of the people \\npeaceably to assemble, and to petition \\nthe Government for a redress of grievances.  \\nU.S.\\n Const., Amdt. 1. \\nIn barring certain kinds of laws, the First \\nAmendment recognizes a pre-existing \\u201cimmun[ity] from such legislative action.\\u201d Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral, supra note 2, at 16. This reflects an \\nunderstanding by the Founding Generation that these \\u201care pre-existent rights\\u2014inalienable rights\\u2014\\n                                           \\n2 O f f i c e  o f  L e g a l  P o l i c y ,  D e p t  o f  J u s t i c e ,  R e p o r t  t o  t h e  \\nAttorney General: Religious Li berty Under the Free Exercise \\nClause at 15 (1986) (hereinafter Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral). \\n 7 \\nand not mere civil privileges conferred by a \\nbenevolent sovereign.\\u201d Id. \\nTaken together, the text, history, and philosophy \\nof the First Amendment establish the principle that \\n\\u201cthe government has no right to interfere with the \\nfree exercise of religion\\u201d unless the \\u201cgovernment \\naction is necessary to prevent manifest danger to the \\nexistence of the state; to protect public peace, safety, \\nand order; or to secure the religious liberty of \\nothers.\\u201d Id., at v. And, even then, only if the \\ngovernment deploys \\u201cthe least restrictive means \\nnecessary to protect these interests.\\u201d Id. This is true \\nas a matter of the First Amendment\\u2019s Religious Liberty Clauses. And because freedom of religion \\ncannot be divorced from freedom of expression, it is \\neven more true when the government tries to force a \\nbeliever to speak in a way that cannot be reconciled \\nwith her religious convictions. \\nA. Religious liberty was profoundly \\nimportant to the Founding Generation; \\nreligious convictions were understood \\nto receive greater deference than mere \\npersonal opinion. \\n1. The Founding Generation was uniquely \\nattuned to issues regarding the proper relationship \\nbetween religion and government. Indeed, at the time of America\\u2019s founding there was \\u201can intense and \\ncontroversial theoretical debate\\u201d of these issues \\ninvolving \\u201c[m]ost of the great political thinkers of the \\nperiod.\\u201d McConnell, Origins, at 1430. These thinkers \\ninformed the Founders\\u2019 own debates on the issue and \\nundoubtedly \\u201cinfluenced the American solution to \\nthe problem.\\u201d Id.  \\n 8 \\nJohn Locke, perhaps more than any other \\nphilosopher who contributed to the ideas \\nunderpinning America\\u2019s founding, provided the \\n\\u201cmost extensive\\u201d discussion of religion and most \\ndirectly influenced the Framers\\u2019 drafting of the First \\nAmendment. Id. Locke was an early and influential \\ntheoretical thinker and advocate for religious freedom. Id., at 1431. In his view \\u201creligious rivalry \\nand intolerance\\u201d were \\u201camong the most important of political problems,\\u201d and \\u201c[r]eligious intolerance was inconsistent both with public peace and with good \\ngovernment.\\u201d Id. \\nLocke\\u2019s solution, however, was an \\u201cunderstanding \\nof religious toleration,\\u201d that \\u201cexpressly precludes free \\nexercise exemptions.\\u201d Id., at 1435. To Locke, when \\n\\u201cindividual conscience conflicts with the governmental policy, the government will always \\nprevail and the individual will always be forced to \\nsubmit or suffer the punishment.\\u201d Id. Locke\\u2019s \\ninfluence on the drafters of the First Amendment makes it all the more remarkable that his view did \\nnot triumph with America\\u2019s founding. \\nThe American Revolution upended the \\npreexisting relationship between religion and government, especially in states where the Anglican \\nChurch had the most influence. Id., at 1436. \\n\\u201cAmerica was in the wake of a great religious \\nrevival,\\u201d that brought with it a \\u201cdrive for religious \\nfreedom.\\u201d Id., at 1437\\u201338. Along with this drive came \\na push from \\u201creligious supporters of disestablishment and free exercise\\u201d to enshrine \\n\\u201cconstitutional protections\\u201d for religious freedoms \\u201cat the federal level.\\u201d Id., at 1440. \\n 9 \\nThis movement was encapsulated in debate \\nsurrounding the religious liberty clause in Virginia\\u2019s \\n1776 Bill of Rights. When George Mason proposed \\nusing the Lockean phrase \\u201ctoleration of religion,\\u201d \\nJames Madison objected, complaining that the \\nphrase implied an act of legislative grace (which, to \\nLocke, it did). Id. , at 1443. Madison was not alone \\namong the Founding Generation in rejecting this concept. George Washin gton and Thomas Paine \\nsimilarly eschewed \\u201ctoleration,\\u201d decrying its \\nimplication of government \\u201cindulgence\\u201d rather than a \\nfundamental, preexisting right. Id., at 1443\\u201344. \\nMoreover, Madison objected to Mason\\u2019s proposal \\nbecause it excepted from even the \\u201ctoleration\\u201d of \\nreligious freedom any instance where \\u201cunder color of \\nreligion any man disturb the peace, the happiness, or \\nsafety of society.\\u201d See G. Hunt, James Madison and \\nReligious Liberty, 1 Ann. Rep. Am. Hist. A. 163, 166 \\n(1901). It was Madison\\u2019s belief that such phrasing \\n\\u201cmight easily be so twisted as to oppress religious \\nsects under the excuse that they disturbed \\u2018the \\npeace, the happiness, or safety of society.\\u2019\\u201d Id. \\nMadison\\u2019s objections were heard by Virginia\\u2019s \\nassembly. As adopted, Virginia\\u2019s Bill of Rights \\npromised that all \\u201care equally entitled to the free \\nexercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience,\\u201d and reminded only \\u201cthat\\n it is the mutual \\nduty of all to practice Christian forbearance, love, and charity towards each other.\\u201d Report to the \\nAttorney General, supra  note 2, at 102\\u201303. \\n2. This early debate between Madison and Mason \\nbears witness to what this Court has long noted\\u2014\\nthat Madison was \\u201cthe leading architect of the \\n 10\\nreligion clauses of the First Amendment.\\u201d Hosanna-\\nTabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v. \\nEEOC , 565 U.S. 171, 184 (2012) (internal quotation \\nmarks omitted). Madison\\u2019s rejection of religious \\ntolerance in favor of full and free religious expression permeates his Memorial and Remonstrance . \\nExplaining that \\u201c[t]he Religion then of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every \\nman,\\u201d Madison understood that it is not just \\u201cthe \\nright of every man to exercise it as these may \\ndictate,\\u201d but further \\u201cthe duty of every man to render \\nto the Creator such homage, and such only, as he \\nbelieves to be acceptable to him.\\u201d J. Madison, \\nMemorial and Remonstrance \\u00a7 1 (1785), reprinted in \\nEverson v. Bd. of Educ. , 330 U.S. 1, 64 (1947). This \\nright, Madison admonished, \\u201cis in its nature an unalienable right.\\u201d Id. \\nMadison expounded his view that \\u201c[t]his duty is \\nprecedent both in order of time and degree of \\nobligation, to the claims of Civil Society.\\u201d Id. Before \\nanyone is \\u201ca member of Civil Society,\\u201d they are \\u201cconsidered as a subject of the Governor of the \\nUniverse.\\u201d Id. For this reason, \\u201cin matters of \\nReligion, no man\\u2019s right is abridged by the institution of Civil Society.\\u201d Id. But Madison went \\nfurther. \\u201c[I]f religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that \\nof the Legislative Body.\\u201d Id., at \\u00a7 2, reprinted in \\nEverson , 330 U.S., at 65. Legislators who \\n\\u201cencroach[]\\u201d on the rights of the people, Madison \\nsaid, \\u201cexceed the commission from which they derive their authority, and are Tyrants.\\u201d Id. \\nRecognizing that Madison\\u2019s Memorial and \\nRemonstrance is not law, see City of Boerne v. Flores , \\n 11\\n521 U.S. 507, 541 (1997) (Scalia, J., concurring), it \\nnonetheless offers a clear understanding of why the \\nFounding Generation thought it so crucial to \\nmemorialize the inalienable freedom of religion in \\nthe First Amendment. And Madison\\u2019s defense of the \\nAmerican conception of religious liberty merely \\nechoed the prevalent thought at the founding \\u201cof the \\ndifference between religious faith and other forms of human judgment.\\u201d McConnell, Origins, at 1496. \\nAt the Founding, the prevailing view was that the \\n\\u201copinions of individuals\\u201d can not take \\u201cprecedence \\nover the decisions of civil society.\\u201d Id. The same was \\nnot true for religious convictions. \\u201cConflicts arising from religious convictions were conceived not as a \\nclash between the judgment of the individual and of \\nthe state, but as a conflict between earthly and \\nspiritual sovereigns.\\u201d Id. In those instances, the \\nperson holding the religious conviction \\u201cwas not seen as the instigator of the conflict; the believer was simply caught between the inconsistent demands of \\ntwo rightful authorities, through no fault of his own.\\u201d \\nId. This view is essential to understanding the \\nFounders\\u2019 belief that \\u201cfreedom of religion is unalienable because it is a duty to God and not a \\nprivilege of the individual.\\u201d Id., at 1497. \\n3. Bolstering this understanding, the historical \\nrecord surrounding adoption of the Bill of Rights \\nsuggests that the First Amendment\\u2019s use of the term \\u201creligion\\u201d was a deliberate choice. See McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1488. Although \\u201c[t]he recorded debates \\nin\\u201d both chambers of Congress \\u201ccast little light on the \\nmeaning of the free exercise clause,\\u201d looking at \\nsuccessive drafts of the clause from its consideration \\nand debate in the First Congress are especially \\n 12\\nenlightening. Id., at 1481, 1483. While earlier drafts \\nof the First Amendment used the phrase \\u201crights of \\nconscience,\\u201d the final version that emerged enshrined in the First Amendment a protection for the \\u201cfree \\nexercise of religion.\\u201d Id., at 1488. This phrasing lends \\nfurther support to the Founders\\u2019 understanding of religious freedoms. \\nTo the Founders, \\u201c[b]elief in a Supreme Being \\nwas\\u201d essential to \\u201creligion.\\u201d Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral, supra  note 2, at 9. Indeed, \\u201c[t]he historical \\nmaterials uniformly equate \\u2018religion\\u2019 with belief in God or in gods.\\u201d McConnell, Origins, at 1493. These references \\u201ccan be extended without distortion to \\ntranscendent extrapersonal authorities not \\nenvisioned in traditionally theistic terms\\u201d\\u2014for \\nexample, Madison\\u2019s use of \\u201cCreator,\\u201d \\u201cGovernor of \\nthe Universe,\\u201d and \\u201cUniversal Sovereign,\\u201d imply \\u201can attempt at a definition more compendious than the \\nfamiliar Judeo-Christian God, but it retains the distinction between transcendent authority and \\npersonal judgment.\\u201d Id.  \\nReligion, as understood by the Founders and \\nexpressed in the First Amendment, then, is best \\ndefined to encompass \\u201ca system of beliefs, whether \\npersonally or institutionally held, prompted by the \\nacceptance of transcendent realities or \\nacknowledging extratemporal actions.\\u201d Report to the \\nAttorney General, supra note 2, at 26\\u201327. This \\ninterpretation of religion is both accurate to the Founders\\u2019 understanding and consistent with their view that religion encompasses \\u201cduties that were \\nbeyond the jurisdiction of the state either to \\nprescribe or to proscribe.\\u201d Id., at 9. To the Founders, \\nreligion encompassed a subservience to a \\n 13\\n\\u201ctranscendent reality,\\u201d which if abandoned could \\nunleash \\u201cextratemporal consequences.\\u201d Id., at 29. \\nThis explains their motivation to preserve a robust freedom from government \\u201cinterfere[nce] with such \\nbeliefs or duties.\\u201d Id. \\nB. The Founding Generation\\u2019s understanding of religious liberty \\nencompassed protection for believers \\nfrom compelled speech that violates \\nfirmly held religious beliefs. \\n1. The least controversial point about the phrase \\n\\u201cfree exercise\\u201d is that \\u201cby definition, the words denote action or activity.\\u201d Id., at 19. To the Founders, \\nreligious liberty undoubtedly included \\u201creligiously motivated conduct  as well as belief.\\u201d McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1488 (emphasis added). This point bears emphasis because of this Court\\u2019s history rejecting \\nsuch a reading. See  Reynolds v. United States , 98 \\nU.S. 145, 164 (1878); but see Fulton v. City of Phila. , \\n141 S. Ct. 1868, 1913 (2021) (Alito, J., concurring) \\n(noting \\u201c[t]he Court ha[s] repudiated that distinction\\u201d in Reynolds  \\u201cthat the Free Exercise \\nClause protects beliefs, not conduct\\u201d). \\nIn substituting the \\u201crights of conscience\\u201d in favor \\nof a protection for the \\u201cfree exercise of religion,\\u201d the \\nFramer\\u2019s chose a phrase that \\u201cstrongly connoted \\naction,\\u201d in place of one that suggested mere opinion \\nor belief. McConnell, Origins, at 1489. Leading \\ndictionaries of that era defined \\u201cexercise\\u201d to include \\n\\u201c[l]abour of the body,\\u201d \\u201c[t]ask; that which one is \\nappointed to perform,\\u201d \\u201c[a]ct of divine worship, \\nwhether public or private,\\u201d or \\u201c[t]o use or practice.\\u201d See id.  (collecting dictionary definitions). Conscience, \\n 14\\non the other hand, was more likely to imply a \\n\\u201cnatural knowledge, or the faculty that decides on \\nthe right or wrong of actions.\\u201d Id. (quoting N. \\nWebster, A Dictionary of The English Language 301 (New Haven 1807)). \\nParticularly instructive on this distinction is the \\nGeorgia Charter of 1732. The Charter included \\u201ca \\nliberty of conscience allowe d in the worship of God, \\nto all persons,\\u201d but reserved the more exclusive right to \\u201ca free exercise of religion,\\u201d only to \\u201call such persons, except papists.\\u201d Id., at 1489\\u201390. By granting \\nCatholics only a liberty of conscience, but not the free exercise of religion, the Georgia Charter necessarily \\nreserved a fuller right to non-Catholic worshipers. \\nOne scholar has observed that \\u201c[t]he most plausible \\nreading of the provision is that it permitted Catholics \\nto believe what they wished . . . but did not permit \\nthem to put their faith into action.\\u201d Id., at 1490. \\nBy including a full and robust \\u201cfree exercise of \\nreligion\\u201d within the First Amendment, the Founders understood that they were protecting not only the \\nright for the religious to believe what their faith \\ntaught, but to put those beliefs into action. To \\nconclude otherwise would be to \\u201ctrivialize the idea of \\nreligion by separating thought from life, faith from \\nworks.\\u201d Report to the Attorney General, supra note \\n2, at 31. Possessing \\u201ca right to believe something in one\\u2019s mind without the freedom to utter it, advocate it, or even translate it into life,\\u201d is hardly a \\nsubstantive freedom at all. Id., at 31\\u201332. \\n2. Consistent with the Founders\\u2019 understanding \\nof a robust religious liberty protection that included \\nthe right to act out your faith was the axiom that \\n 15\\naction naturally includes expression or the freedom \\nto refrain from expression that conflicts with belief. \\nAlthough early religious liberty controversies were \\nrelatively limited, the historical record includes \\nexamples of protections for religious exercise \\nintertwined with such expressive activity. \\nAn early source of common conflict, for example, \\narose around the issue of oath requirements. Oaths \\nserved as \\u201cthe principal means of ensuring honest \\ntestimony and solemnizing obligations.\\u201d McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1467. But many early religious sects \\nrefused to take an oath, believing it was in conflict \\nwith the teachings of the New Testament.3 Id. \\nBecause oaths were required before court testimony, this refusal often left these sincere religious objectors \\nwithout access to the court system. Id. \\nIn response, many of the early colonies adopted \\nalternatives, allowing relig ious dissenters to take a \\npledge or make an affirmation rather than to swear \\nan oath. Id., at 1467\\u201368 (\\u201cBy 1789, virtually all of the \\nstates had enacted oath exemptions.\\u201d). This simple solution permitted religious sects access to the court \\nsystem, without requiring them to act out of step \\n                                           \\n3 See Matthew 5:33-37 (\\u201cAgain, ye have heard that it hath \\nbeen said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, \\nbut shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: But I say unto you, \\nSwear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: Nor \\nby the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is \\nthe city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy \\nhead, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever \\nis more than these cometh of evil.\\u201d). \\n 16\\nwith their religious beliefs or to make an expression \\nthey found incompatible with their faith. \\nA still more extreme example of laws yielding to \\nexpressive activities of religious sects in the \\nFounding Generation can be found in colonial \\nGeorgia. There, the Trus tees of Georgia granted \\ncertain groups of religious refugees a general exemption from the laws that allowed them \\u201cto organize themselves in accordance with their own \\nfaith.\\u201d Id., at 1471. One historia n described one such \\ngroup from Salzburg\\u2014which formed the town of Ebenezer\\u2014as \\u201ca state within a state, a sort of \\ntheocracy under the direction of their minsters with \\ndaily conferences of the entire congregation in which \\nGod\\u2019s guidance was invoked at the beginning and the \\nend.\\u201d Id. Although these groups where required to \\nobey certain colonial laws pertaining to military service, property, and good governance, they were \\n\\u201cotherwise free to govern themselves.\\u201d Id. at 1471 \\nn.312 \\nAnother founding era example of religious \\nexemptions for expressive action appeared in North \\nCarolina and Maryland. There, laws exempted \\nmembers of certain religious sects from a \\nrequirement to remove their hat in court. Id. The \\nreligious objectors viewed such an action as \\u201ca form of obeisance to secular authority forbidden by their \\nreligion.\\u201d Id., at 1472. Rather than forcing members \\nof these sects to choose be tween access to the courts \\nor expressing themselves in violation of their religious beliefs, states offered an exemption. \\nWhile this example may seem trivial by today\\u2019s \\nstandards, it was very mu ch on the minds of the \\n 17\\nFounding Generation. At the time, \\u201c[o]ne of the most \\nnotorious courtroom cases of religious intolerance in \\nEngland involved William Penn\\u2019s refusal to remove \\nhis hat when he appeared in court\\u201d to face \\nindictment for speaking to  an unlawful assembly. Id. \\nWhen Penn refused to remove a court-furnished hat from his head in respect to the court, he was held in \\ncontempt and imprisoned. Id. This case attracted \\nsignificant attention in America, and undoubtedly influenced the exemptions passed in North Carolina and Maryland. Id. \\nIndeed, the importance of this exemption was \\ndemonstrated in debates over the Bill of Rights in \\nthe First Congress. Id., at 1472, n.320. In ridiculing \\nthe list of freedoms proposed to be protected, Theodore Sedgwick of Mass achusetts remarked \\u201cthey \\nmight have declared that a man should have a right to wear his hat if he pleased . . . but he would ask the \\ngentleman whether he thought it necessary to enter \\nthese trifles in a declaration of rights.\\u201d Id. (citation \\nomitted). With unmistakable reference to the Penn case, John Page of Virginia replied: \\nThe gentleman from \\nMassachusetts . . . objects to the clause, \\nbecause the right is of so trivial a \\nnature. He supposes it no more \\nessential than whether a man has a \\nright to wear his hat or not; but let me \\nobserve to him that such rights have \\nbeen opposed, and a man has been obliged to pull off his hat when he \\nappeared before the face of authority; \\npeople have also been prevented from \\n 18\\nassembling together on their lawful \\noccasions.  \\nId. (citation omitted). Certainly, the Founders were \\nacutely aware of the potential for abuse by \\nauthorities absent a robust religious liberty \\nprotection that clearly extended to actions, including \\nreligiously motivated expression or non-expression. \\n3. Taken together, the Free Exercise Clause and \\nthe Free Speech Clause elevate the freedom not to \\nspeak out of accordance with firmly held religious beliefs to the highest echelon of First Amendment \\nprotection. This conclusion is buttressed by the First \\nAmendment\\u2019s other guarantees\\u2014e.g., freedom of \\nassembly and freedom to petition the government. If \\nthe Free Exercise Clause conferred nothing more \\nthan a \\u201cright to express religious beliefs,\\u201d it would \\n\\u201cadd nothing to the First Amendment, since that right is fully protected by the right to assemble, \\nspeak, and publish.\\u201d Report to the Attorney General, \\nsupra note 2, at 19. Indeed, \\u201cbecause religious \\nexpression is doubly protected by the constitutional \\ntext\\u201d it would make little sense if it were \\u201cless \\nprotected in practice.\\u201d Id. , at 19, n.30. \\nThe examples cited above represent a clear \\nunderstanding by the Founding Generation that civil \\nlaws, even of general applicability, must yield when they conflict with religious expression or the freedom \\nto refrain from expression on the basis of a sincerely \\nheld religious belief. As it seems early legislative \\nbodies believed exemptions in such cases were \\nrequired by the principle of free exercise, it stands to \\nreason that the Framers understood \\u201csimilar \\napplications of the principle\\u201d would guide the courts \\n 19\\nin these cases, once \\u201centrusted with the \\nresponsibility of enforcing\\u201d First Amendment \\nguarantees. McConnell, Origins, at 1473. \\nAlthough there was a dearth of litigation over \\nreligious liberty protections in the early years of the \\nRepublic, what scarce examples exist support this \\nview. Consider, for example, the earliest state court \\nopinion addressing the issue of a religious liberty exemption, People v. Phillips . In that case, the court \\nheld that the New York Constitution protected a Catholic priest from compulsory testimony to \\nmatters learned while administering the Sacrament \\nof Confession. See  id., at 1504. \\nImportant to the Phillips court was the notion \\nthat requiring testimony from the priest to \\u201cwhat he \\nreceives in confession, is to declare that there shall \\nbe no penance; and this important branch of the Roman Catholic religion would be thus annihilated.\\u201d \\nId. (citation omitted). The court did not believe it was \\ncompatible with religious liberty to compel expression that would so eviscerate a core belief of Catholic faith. Rather than establishing a special \\nprivilege for adherents to the Catholic faith, though, \\nthe court viewed its actions as necessary to ensure \\nCatholics received the same  treatment as Protestants \\n(the dominant faith at the time) in the administration of their sacraments. Id., at 1504-05. \\nThe through line to the Founding Generation\\u2019s \\nunderstanding of religious liberty was a belief that \\nsuch freedom was without substantive meaning if it did not encompass expression, and non-expression, \\nrooted in religious belief. Noted Nineteenth Century \\n 20\\nConstitutional commentator, Michigan Supreme \\nCourt Justice Thomas Cooley, explained: \\nAn earnest believer usually regards it as his duty to propagate his opinions, \\nand to bring others to his views. To \\ndeprive him of this right is to take from \\nhim the power to perform what he \\nconsiders a most sacred obligation.  \\nT. Cooley, A Treatise on the Constitutional \\nLimitations 665 (7th ed. 1903). Put another way: \\nreligious freedom, as understood by the Founders, \\nnecessarily encompasses the freedom to put belief \\ninto action, to engage in expression consistent with \\nthe dogmas of your faith, and to refrain from \\nexpression that may engender extratemporal consequences. \\nII. T\\nHIS COURT \\u2019S PRECEDENTS \\u2014ESPECIALLY ITS \\nDEMANDING APPLICATION OF THE LEAST -\\nRESTRICTIVE MEANS TEST \\u2014DEMONSTRATE \\nAGREEMENT WITH THE FOUNDING GENERATION \\u2019S \\nROBUST RELIGIOUS LIBERTY PROTECTIONS . \\nThis Court has a commendable history of \\nrecognizing the principles discussed above. In \\nparticular, the Court\\u2019s recent religious liberty \\njurisprudence has been a welcome reprieve for \\nmembers of all faith communities who have been disheartened by the antagonism of some government \\nactors. See,  e.g., Espinoza v. Mont. Dept of Revenue , \\n140 S. Ct. 2246 (2020); Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. \\nColo. Civil Rights Comm\\u2019n , 138 S. Ct. 1719 (2018); \\nHosanna-Tabor , 565 U.S. 171. \\n 21\\nOf particular note is the Court\\u2019s insistence on a \\nforceful application of the strict scrutiny test to any \\nrestriction that burdens religious liberty. Indeed, \\u201cin \\nthis highly sensitive constitutional area, \\u2018only the \\ngravest abuses, endangering paramount interests, \\ngive occasion for permissible limitation.\\u2019\\u201d Sherbert v. \\nVerner , 374 U.S. 398, 406 (1963) (quoting Thomas v. \\nCollins, 323 U.S. 516, 530 (1945)). \\n1. A few examples illustrate the point. Consider \\nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. , where this \\nCourt considered a government-imposed contraceptive mandate on private employers who \\nbelieved such a requirement to be against their \\nreligious beliefs. 573 U.S. 682, 726 (2014).\\n4 While \\nassuming, without deciding, that the government\\u2019s \\ninterest was compelling, the Court nonetheless found \\nthat the least-restrictive-means standard was not \\nmet. Id., at 728. Identifying alternative solutions to \\nthe rigid mandate imposed by the government, the Court explained, \\u201c[t]he least-restrictive-means \\nstandard is exceptionally demanding.\\u201d Id.  As Justice \\nKennedy explained, religious freedom \\u201cimplicates more than just freedom of belief\\u201d; rather \\u201c[i]t means, too, the right to express those beliefs and to establish \\none\\u2019s religious (or nonreligious) self-definition in the \\npolitical, civic, and econ omic life of our larger \\n                                           \\n4 Hobby Lobby  was decided under the Religious Freedom \\nRestoration Act of 1993 (\\u201cRFRA\\u201d), which requires as an initial \\nmatter finding a substantial government burden on the exercise of religion; if such a burden exists, the Court must determine \\nwhether there is a compelling governmental interest and that \\nthe burden is the least restrictive means of furthering that \\ninterest. Hobby Lobby , 573 U.S., at 694-95. \\n 22\\ncommunity.\\u201d Id., at 736\\u201337 (Kennedy, J., \\nconcurring). \\nIn another instance, this Court found Missouri \\nviolated a church\\u2019s religious  liberty guarantees under \\nthe First Amendment when it categorically denied \\ntheir participation in a grant program for playground \\nsurface materials. Trinity Lutheran Church of \\nColumbia, Inc. v. Comer , 137 S. Ct. 2012, 2017, 2025 \\n(2017). Finding that otherwise eligible grant \\nrecipients were disqualified solely because of their \\nreligious nature, this Court held that such a penalty \\nworked against the free exercise of religion and \\u201ctriggers the most exacting scrutiny.\\u201d Id., at 2021. \\nImportantly, the harm was not the denial of the grant itself but instead was Missouri\\u2019s refusal to \\neven allow the church to compete with secular \\norganizations for grant funds solely on the basis of \\nits religious identity. Id., at 2022. \\nMore recently still, this Court took up the mantle \\nof religious liberties in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia . \\nDespite the Catholic Church\\u2019s over two centuries of dedication to serving the needy children of \\nPhiladelphia, the City in 2018 stopped referring foster children to the Catholic Social Services (\\u201cCSS\\u201d) \\nafter learning the organization would not \\u201cconsider \\nprospective foster parents in same-sex marriages.\\u201d \\nFulton , 141 S. Ct., at 1874\\u201375. Finding that \\u201cit is \\nplain\\u201d the City burdens CSS\\u2019s \\u201creligious exercise by putting it to the choice of  curtailing its mission or \\napproving relationships inconsistent with its beliefs,\\u201d this Court sought a review of whether such burden \\nwas \\u201cconstitutionally permissible.\\u201d Id., at 1876. In \\ndetermining that Philadelphia imposed an unconstitutional burden on CSS\\u2019s religious exercise, \\n 23\\nFulton  admonishes that \\u201cso lo ng as the government \\ncan achieve its interests in a manner that does not \\nburden religion, it must do so.\\u201d Id., at 1881. \\nTaken together, the precedents of this Court \\nestablish that an exacting analysis is required in \\nreligious liberty cases to determine whether the \\ngovernment\\u2019s interest is compelling, and its burden \\nnarrowly tailored to achieve that interest. The \\nexistence of an alternative means for achieving even \\na compelling interest is nearly always fatal to the government\\u2019s argument.  \\n2. When religious liberty and free expression \\nconcerns intertwine, this Court has been even less \\nhesitant to invalidate an infringing law. This \\nskepticism is warranted, as attempts to compel \\nexpression that conflicts with an individual\\u2019s \\nreligious beliefs are nothing more than indirect \\nattempts to regulate religion itself. \\nIn 1943, this Court took issue with a West \\nVirginia law mandating a flag salute and pledge, when its application was challenged by a group of \\nJehovah\\u2019s Witnesses who said such action violated \\ntheir religious beliefs. W. Va. State Bd. Of Educ. V. \\nBarnette , 319 U.S. 624 (1943). Refusing to find that \\n\\u201ca Bill of Rights which guards the individual\\u2019s right \\nto speak his own mind, left it open to public \\nauthorities to compel him to utter what is not on his \\nmind,\\u201d the Barnette  Court blocked the law\\u2019s \\nenforcement. Id. , at 634; see also  id., at 645 (Murphy, \\nJ., concurring) (recognizing \\u201c[t]he right of freedom of thought and of religion as guaranteed by the \\nConstitution against State action includes both the \\nright to speak freely and the right to refrain from \\n 24\\nspeaking at all\\u201d). Underlying the Court\\u2019s opinion was \\nthe belief that \\u201c[i]f there is any fixed star in our \\nconstitutional constellation, it is that no official, high \\nor petty, can prescribe what  shall be orthodox in \\npolitics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act \\ntheir faith therein.\\u201d Id., at 642. \\nExpanding on the holding in Barnette , the Court \\nin Wooley v. Maynard  considered a religious \\nobjection to display of the New Hampshire state motto\\u2014\\u201cLive Free or Die\\u201d\\u2014on the license plate of a \\ncar owned by Jehovah\\u2019s Witness. 430 U.S. 705 (1977). In Wooley , the Court expressly rejected the \\nidea that \\u201cthe State may constitutionally require an individual to participate in the dissemination of an \\nideological message by displaying it on his private \\nproperty.\\u201d Id., at 713. \\nFoundational to its decision was the Court\\u2019s \\nholding that the freedoms contained within the First \\nAmendment \\u201cincludes both the right to speak freely \\nand the right to refrain from speaking at all.\\u201d Id., at \\n714. It matters not whether most agree with the message the State seeks to force a person to convey; the First Amendment unquestionably \\u201cprotects the \\nright of individuals to hold a point of view different \\nfrom the majority and to refu se to foster . . . an idea \\nthey find morally objectionable.\\u201d Id. , at 715. Finding \\nthe existence of a governmental burden, the Court \\nwas left to question whether a substantial \\ngovernmental interest existed and, if so, whether the \\nburden was narrowly tailored to advance that \\ninterest. Even assuming a legitimate and substantial interest, the Court concluded \\u201cthat purpose cannot \\nbe pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental \\n 25\\npersonal liberties when the end can be more \\nnarrowly achieved.\\u201d Id., at 716. New Hampshire \\nfailed that test. \\nIn still another line of cases, this Court found \\nthat it violated Constitutional protections to subject religious observants, who went door to door \\ndistributing religious materials and soliciting for the \\npurchase of religious books, to a government \\nsolicitation registration requirement. Murdock v. \\nPennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105 (1943); see also Follett v. \\nTown of McCormick , 321 U.S. 573 (1944). \\nAcknowledging that the practice was derived from the believer\\u2019s understanding that he was \\u201cobeying a \\ncommandment of God,\\u201d the Court found that the First Amendment prohibited the imposition of a \\ngenerally applicable registration requirement to \\nengage in such conduct. Murdock , 319 U.S., at 108, \\n117. Indeed, the Court went out of its way to describe the literature being distributed as \\u201cprovocative, \\nabusive, and ill-mannered.\\u201d Id., at 115\\u201316. \\nNevertheless, \\u201c[p]lainly  a community may not \\nsuppress . . . the dissemination of views because they \\nare unpopular, annoying or distasteful.\\u201d Id.,  at 116 \\nTo allow otherwise would \\u201cbe a complete repudiation of the philosophy of the Bill of Rights.\\u201d Id. \\nThe Court went further still , establishing that the \\nmere fact the religious materials were being \\u201csold\\u201d was not enough to transform \\u201cevangelism into a \\ncommercial enterprise.\\u201d Id., at 111. As such, the \\nCourt acknowledged heightened constitutional protections for \\u201cthose spreading their religious \\nbeliefs through the spoken and printed word.\\u201d Id. As \\ncompared to purely commercial activity, \\u201c[f]reedom of \\n 26\\npress, freedom of speech, fr eedom of religion are in a \\npreferred position.\\u201d Id., at 115. \\nEven Employment Division v. Smith , often \\ncriticized as having watered down constitutional \\nreligious liberty protections, recognized the Court\\u2019s \\nunique hostility toward burdens that implicate both \\nthe free exercise of religion and the freedom of \\nspeech. The \\u201cFirst Amendment bars application of a \\nneutral, generally applicable law to religiously \\nmotivated action\\u201d when that action \\u201cinvolve[s] not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but the Free \\nExercise Clause in conjunction with other \\nconstitutional protections, such as freedom of \\nspeech.\\u201d Empl. Div. v. Smith , 494 U.S. 872, 881\\u201382 \\n(1990). Even some preceden ts, decided on free speech \\ngrounds alone, were undoubtedly reinforced by \\ntouches of freedom-of-religion concerns. Id. \\n3. This much is clear: the arc of this Court\\u2019s \\nprecedent bends in one incontrovertible direction. \\nScrutiny of any government burden is at its zenith \\nwhen the burden effects an individual\\u2019s exercise of their religious beliefs in a manner that implicates \\nfree speech protections. This conclusion, rooted in the \\nhistory and tradition of religious exercise as \\nunderstood by the Founders and enshrined in the \\nFirst Amendment, demands that any such burden be \\nsubjected to the most rigorous application of strict \\nscrutiny analysis. \\nIt is precisely for this reason that, to the best of \\nAmicus Curiae\\u2019s knowledge, the Court has never \\nissued an opinion finding that governmentally \\ncompelled religious speech satisfies strict scrutiny. \\nSee 303 Creative Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Elenis , 6 F.4th \\n 27\\n1160, 1191 (U.S. 10th Cir. 2021) (Tymkovich, C.J., \\ndissenting) (\\u201c[T]he majority takes the remarkable\\u2014\\nand novel\\u2014stance that the government may force \\nMs. Smith to produce messages that violate her \\nconscience. . . . No case has ever gone so far.\\u201d). \\nThis case should not be the first. \\nIII. THE TENTH CIRCUIT \\u2019S OPINION CANNOT BE \\nSQUARED EITHER WITH THE FIRST \\nAMENDMENT \\u2019S RICH HISTORY OR THIS COURT \\u2019S \\nPROTECTION OF BELIEVERS \\u2019 FREE SPEECH \\nRIGHTS . \\nIn its permissive application of strict scrutiny, the \\nTenth Circuit bastardized this Court\\u2019s protection of free speech rights, especially as applied to religious \\nexpression. If allowed to stand, its precedent will give license to courts across this Country to \\nhumiliate members of all religious sects by \\ncompelling them to speak in contravention of their \\nsincerely held religious beliefs. By purporting to \\napply strict scrutiny, the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s opinion \\ncheapened the First Amendment rights of Catholics, \\nProtestants, Muslims, Jews, and all other believers alike. \\nLuckily, this precedent d oes not need to stand. \\nThis Court, once again, has an opportunity to \\nadmonish that the free speech protections of \\nbelievers are no less than non-believers and, in fact, \\nare heightened when faced with government \\nregulation that would compel speech antithetical to the tenants of a believer\\u2019s faith. The First \\nAmendment commands such a result. \\n 28\\nAlthough the Tenth Circuit rightly concluded that \\nMs. Smith\\u2019s website designs are \\u201cpure speech,\\u201d 303 \\nCreative LLC, 6 F.4th, at 1176, the Tenth Circuit \\nwrongly concludes that the commercial nature of Ms. \\nSmith\\u2019s speech gives Colorado a regulatory hook to \\nlatch onto. Id., at 1179. By failing to acknowledge the \\nreligious nature of her objection to the would-be compelled speech, the Tenth Circuit did not afford \\nher First Amendment rights the \\u201cpreferred\\u201d status \\nthey deserve.\\n5 Cf., Murdock , 319 U.S., at 115. What \\nis remarkable is that the religious nature of Ms. Smith\\u2019s objection is not disputed. See 303 \\nCreative, 6 F. 4th, at 1172 (Ms. Smith is \\u201cwilling to create custom graphics and websites for gay, lesbian, \\nor bisexual clients . . . so long as the custom graphics \\nand websites do not violate [her] religious beliefs, as is true for all customers.\\u201d (internal quotation marks \\nomitted)); id., at 1192 (Tymkovich, C.J., dissenting) \\n(\\u201cIn short, Colorado appear s to agree that Ms. Smith \\ndoes not distinguish between customers based on \\nprotected-class status and thus advances the aims of \\nCADA. But when any customer asks Ms. Smith to \\ncreate expressive content that violates her sincerely \\nheld beliefs, she will decline the request.\\u201d). \\n                                           \\n5 Remarkably, the Tenth Circuit  suggests that its sweeping \\nholding may not apply to \\u201call artists\\u201d if they were not engaged \\nin \\u201ccommercial activity,\\u201d but rather \\u201ccommissioning a mural for some charitable purpose.\\u201d 303 Creative , 6 F.4th, at 1182, n.6. To \\nsuggest that a local artist wh o refuses to paint a Christian \\nmural for a church may enjoy more constitutional protections \\nthan a woman called to live out her sincerely held religious \\nbeliefs by creating custom wedding websites is, thankfully, not supported by the history or tradition of the First Amendment \\nand the muscular protections it affords religious believers. \\n 29\\nThis failure is compounded by the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s \\nfallacy of a marketplace of one for Ms. Smith\\u2019s \\nspeech. Id. at 1180. Such convenient analysis \\nallowed the court to conclude \\u201cthere are no less intrusive means of providing equal access to those  \\ntypes of services.\\u201d Id. (emphasis added). But this \\nclever reasoning flips this Court\\u2019s precedent on its \\nhead. Rather than prioritize the religious speaker\\u2019s \\nobjection in search of a less restrictive means, the \\ncourt below merely concluded that she is the only one and therefore no other means will suffice. But, \\nwhere, as here, the government can achieve its interests without burdening religion, the \\nConstitution requires it to do so. Fulton , 141 S. Ct., \\nat 1881. The analysis is also anomalous in the free speech context because it cannot be that the more \\nunique and distinctive the speech, the less  First \\nAmendment protection it deserves. But that is the staggering breadth of the Tenth Circuit majority\\u2019s \\nconclusion. See 303 Creative , 6 F.4th, at 1204-05 \\n(Tymkovich, C.J., dissenting).  \\nMoreover, by categorizing Ms. Smith as nothing \\nmore than a \\u201cpublic accommodation,\\u201d the Tenth \\nCircuit minimized her right to participate in the \\nmarketplace, even as a woman of faith. See 303 \\nCreative, 6 F.4th, at 1181 (\\u201c[W]hether an exception limits market access depends upon the uniqueness of \\nthe public accommodation\\u2019s goods and services\\u2014not \\nthe sincerity of the public accommodation\\u2019s beliefs.\\u201d). \\nTo deny a benefit to those \\u201cwho engage in certain \\nforms of speech is in effect to penalize them for such \\nspeech,\\u201d and constitutionally, no different than \\nconditioning a benefit on a person\\u2019s \\u201cwillingness to \\nviolate a cardinal principle of her religious faith;\\u201d the \\n 30\\nresult is the same: to \\u201cdeter[] or discourage[] the \\nexercise of First Amendment rights of expression.\\u201d \\nSherbert , 374 U.S., at 405-06 (citing Speiser v. \\nRandall, 357 U.S. 513, 518 (1958)). Here too, Colorado seeks to impose the same constitutional \\nharm: speak in violation of your core religious faith \\nor lose the benefit of marketplace participation. Put \\nsimply, Colorado seeks to punish Ms. Smith for her \\nsincerely held religious beliefs. See also Trinity \\nLutheran Church , 137 S. Ct., at 2021\\u201322 (finding a \\nconstitutional violation where a burden puts \\nreligious believers \\u201cto a choice: [] participate in an \\notherwise available benefit\\u201d or maintain your \\nreligious identity). \\nThe same fundamental principle must apply to \\nfree speech and religious practices when they act in concert: \\u201cIn an open, pluralistic, self-governing \\nsociety, the expression of an idea cannot be \\nsuppressed simply because some find it offensive, \\ninsulting, or even wounding.\\u201d Fulton , 141 S. Ct., at \\n1924-25 (Alito, J., concurring). To lose this principle is to lose the \\u201cpreservation of religious freedom.\\u201d Id., \\nat 1925. That is because \\u201c[s]uppressing speech\\u2014or \\nreligious practice\\u2014simply because it expresses an idea that some find hurtful is a zero-sum game.\\u201d Id. \\nThis Court\\u2019s jurisprudence confirms this link \\nbetween religious exercise and free speech because \\nthis Court\\u2019s opinions \\u201cmake it perfectly clear that \\ndiscrimination against religious, as opposed to \\nsecular, expression is viewpoint discrimination.\\u201d \\nNurre v. Whitehead , 559 U.S. 1025, 1028 (2010) \\n(Alito, J., dissenting). And because viewpoint discrimination is \\u201can egregious form of content \\ndiscrimination,\\u201d Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of \\n 31\\nthe Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995), it brings \\nwith it heightened constitutional skepticism. \\nAlthough some may find Ms. Smith\\u2019s religious \\nbeliefs objectionable, \\u201creligions, and those who \\nadhere to religious doctrines, may continue to \\nadvocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by \\ndivine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be \\ncondoned.\\u201d Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U.S. 644, 679 \\n(2015). \\u201cAn open society can keep that promise while still respecting the \\u2018dignity,\\u2019 \\u2018worth,\\u2019 and fundamental equality of all members of the \\ncommunity.\\u201d Fulton , 141 S. Ct., at 1925 (Alito, J., \\nconcurring) (quoting Masterpiece Cakeshop , 138 S. \\nCt., at 1727). Ms. Smith should be free to practice all \\naspects of her faith, without fear of government-\\ncompelled expression against her sincerely held \\nreligious beliefs. The Constitution demands no less. \\nCONCLUSION \\n \\n\\u201c[T]here is before us the right of freedom to \\nbelieve, freedom to worship one\\u2019s Maker according to the dictates of one\\u2019s conscience, a right which the \\nConstitution specifically shelters.\\u201d Barnette , 319 \\nU.S., at 645 (Murphy, J., concurring). For this Court, there is \\u201cno loftier duty or responsibility than to \\nuphold that spiritual freedom to its farthest \\nreaches.\\u201d Id. \\nTo exclude Ms. Smith from offering her services\\u2014\\nsolely on the basis of her religious identity\\u2014would be \\n\\u201codious to our Constitution.\\u201d Trinity Lutheran \\nChurch , 137 S. Ct., at 2025. \\n 32\\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should \\nreverse the opinion of the Tenth Circuit.  \\nJune 2, 2022   Respectfully submitted,  \\n \\nJonathan P.

As part of that project, EPA has obtained emails and handwritten and typewritten notes under public records requests, which records on their face confess to the driving factor behind this liti-gation and similar litigation and inform the inquiry into federal versus state jurisdiction in this booming class of \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation filed in state courts. These records EPA obtained prompted it to file its first amicus  brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for \\nthe First Circuit, where removal of another among the growing number of \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d lawsuits filed \\nby governmental entities seeking billions of dollars \\nfrom private parties is pending.\\n2 That brief revealed \\ntwo sets of notes each purporting, independently, to record the assertion by an official with the governmen-tal plaintiff in that case, the State of Rhode Island, that the litigation seeks to obtain a \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d to underwrite that State\\u2019s spending ambitions, \\n \\n 1 Pursuant to Rule 37.6, counsel for Amicus  certifies that no \\ncounsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in part and that no person or entity other than Amici  or their counsel made a \\nmonetary contribution intended to fund the brief \\u2019s preparation or submission. All parties\\u2019 counsel of record received notice regarding \\nthe filing of this brief on April 27,  2020. This brief is filed by con-\\nsent of all parties. Petitioners fil ed a blanket consent for all such \\nbriefs on April 13, 2020. Respondent provided its written consent via email on April 29, 2020. \\n \\n2 See State of Rhode Island v. Shell Oil Products Co., LLC, et \\nal., Case No. 19-1818 (1st Cir.). Leave for EPA to file as amicus \\ncuriae  granted on March 26, 2020 \\n2 \\n after the State\\u2019s legislature declined to provide the de-\\nsired funds. Rhode Island\\u2019s confession was made at a meeting attended by \\u201ccabinet\\u201d-level representatives of numerous state governments from across the nation, including a representative from Maryland, and empha-sized the desire to pr oceed in state courts.\\n3 In that First \\nCircuit litigation, numerous  parties rely upon the \\nFourth Circuit\\u2019s decision in  the instant matter, and par-\\nties to the First Circuit litigation ad dressed the Fourth \\nCircuit\\u2019s opinion below in let ters of supplemental au-\\nthority pursuant to Fed. R. Ap p. Pro. 28(j). Because EPA \\nhas obtained records confe ssing the rationale behind \\nthe veritable tsunami of state-court \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d lawsuits such as the one now before this Court, and af-firming the plaintiffs\\u2019 emp hasis among peers and other \\npotential governmental plaint iff-recruits on using state \\ncourts for these actions with  national p olicy implica-\\ntions and avoiding the federal court system, EPA is keenly interested in this case and asks this Court to \\ngrant certiorari to address th e proper relationship be-\\ntween the state and federal court systems. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\n As important as climate policy is to both state and \\nfederal governments, equally and arguably more im-portant is the principle that the courts\\u2019 role is not to \\nmake policy judgments. This Court held in American \\nElectric Power v. Connecticut , 131 S. Ct. 2527, 2539, \\n \\n 3 A full list of attendees prepared by the organizers and ob-\\ntained under Colorado law is ava ilable at https://govoversight.org/ \\nwp-content/uploads/2020/01/Fulsome-list-of-participants.png. \\n3 \\n 564 U.S. 410, 426 (2011) that \\u201cthe federal courts would \\nhave no warrant to employ the federal common law of nuisance to upset\\u201d federal primacy in climate regula-tory policy. But rather than heed the American Electric \\nPower  opinion\\u2019s warnings that federal policy decisions \\nare to be made by Congress or by federal agencies ex-ercising properly delegated authority, certain litigants have instead attempted to end run that holding by seeking to create policy in state, rather than federal, courts. While federal courts ar e courts of limited juris-\\ndiction, in this matter the de cision below is based upon \\na series of cases that have eviscerated the jurisdiction of federal courts, even when important federal inter-ests are at stake. This is in conflict with the decisions of other Circuits, congressional action taken since these \\nFourth Circuit precedents were  adopted, and this Court\\u2019s \\nown rulings. Allowing the opin ion below to stand will \\ncause mischief in state courts across the nation. Re-cently obtained public records provide strong impetus to acknowledge, as a formal matter, that this \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation campaign is an impermissible use of the state courts, just as this Court previously held it \\nwas an impermissible use of the federal courts. This Court should prevent litigants from seeking the most favorable forum to obtain p olitical and policy ends by \\njudicial means. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\n  \\n4 \\n ARGUMENT \\nI. THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\\u2019S DECISION CON-\\nTRADICTS RECENT JURISPRUDENCE \\nAND LEGISLATION. THIS COURT SHOULD \\nGRANT CERTIORARI TO ENFORCE ITS OWN PRECEDENTS AND CONGRESSIONAL INTENT \\n The decision below, designated for publication and \\nwith the potential to shape or confuse the law for years \\nto come, is based on a series of precedents unique to the Fourth Circuit, many of which contradict more re-\\ncent holdings of this Court and even statutory changes \\nenacted by Congress. The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s reliance on its own, idiosyncratic precedents led to a result that is \\nin conflict with the holdings  of numerous other courts \\nand which will, if allowed to stand, result in mischief across the nation. \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision below, while pub-\\nlished only this year, has its foundations in a holding \\nfrom the 1970s that has been  adrift in changing legal \\nseas since then, and was implicitly swamped by a hold-ing of this Court twenty years ago. That Fourth Circuit \\nopinion, Noel v. McCain , 538 F.2d 633 (4th Cir. 1976), \\nheld that remand orders are essentially unreviewable unless they raise very narrow statutory grounds. Stare \\ndecisis  is an important legal principle, but in this case \\nthe Fourth Circuit\\u2019s adherence to its own precedents rather than those of this Court was misplaced. \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision below acknowledges \\nthat this Court subsequently interpreted the same \\n5 \\n statutory language differently in Yamaha Motor Corp., \\nU.S.A. v. Calhoun , 516 U.S. 199 (1996). More recently, \\nthe Seventh Circuit reached a contrary conclusion \\nabout the reviewability of di strict court orders to re-\\nmand in Lu Junhong v. Boeing Co. , 792 F.3d 805, 810\\u2013\\n13 (7th Cir. 2015). Even assuming, arguendo , that the \\nFourth Circuit properly decided the Noel  case in 1976, \\ncontinued reliance on Noel  is no longer appropriate. \\n It isn\\u2019t just precedent t hat has changed since the \\nFourth Circuit issued its opinion in Noel . Relevant \\nstatutory law has also changed: the Removal Clarifica-\\ntion Act of 2011, Pub. L. No. 112-51, 125 Stat. 545, clar-ified Congressional intent for federal courts to \\u201cclarify \\nand improve certain provisions relating to the removal \\nof litigation against Federal officers or agencies to Fed-\\neral courts.\\u201d \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision below (hereinafter \\n\\u201cBaltimore \\u201d), is based on foundations that Congress, \\nother federal courts, and this Court have steadily \\neroded since the Fourth Circu it issued the authority on \\nwhich Baltimore  rests. This Court, the Seventh Circuit, \\nand Congress itself have all spoken more recently. The \\ninnovative legal theories brought by the Plaintiffs in this case further highlight the need to decide the mat-\\nter based on current law. This Court should take the \\nopportunity to apply the Removal Clarification Act and resolve the split in the circuits that the Baltimore  opin-\\nion below aggravates. \\n \\n6 \\n II. IF THE DECISION BELOW STANDS, FED-\\nERAL COURTS WILL BE UNABLE TO PRE-\\nVENT FEDERAL POLICIES FROM BEING UNDERMINED AT THE STATE LEVEL \\n This suit is but one of many similar suits being \\nfiled all over the country. More than a dozen U.S. cit-\\nies, states and counties including the State of Rhode Island, City and County of Boulder (CO), City and \\nCounty of Honolulu (HI), City of New York (NY), \\nMarin, San Mateo and Santa Cruz Counties (CA), the cities of Imperial Beach, Oakland, Richmond, San \\nFrancisco, San Mateo, and Santa Cruz (CA), and King \\nCounty (WA), among others have filed similar claims against similar and generally the same defendants al-\\nleging similar causes of action which allegedly arise \\nunder state law. As at least one court has previously noted, multi-front litigation raises important concerns \\nabout the motivations of litigants. Chevron Corp. v. \\nDonziger , 974 F.Supp.2d 362, 475 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (\\u201cThe \\npoint of the multi-front strategy thus was to leverage \\nthe expense, risks, and bu rden to [defendant] of de-\\nfending itself in multiple jurisdictions to achieve a swift recovery, most likely by precipitating a settle-\\nment.\\u201d), later upheld at Chevron Corp. v. Donziger , 833 \\nF.3d 74 (2d Cir. 2016), cert. denied  at 137 S. Ct. 2268 \\n(2017). \\n This explosion in such cases filed in state court \\nseeks many hundreds of billions of dollars from private \\nparties, and seeks to enlist the defendants as advo-\\ncates in pressing for the plai ntiffs\\u2019 and their partners\\u2019 \\ndesired federal policies. Records obtained by Amicus  \\n7 \\n also show the attempt to us e the litigation to obtain \\ngovernmental revenues after that failed through the \\nappropriate, political process (see, infra ). Affirming the \\nimpropriety of this use of the courts as well as the ar-dent campaign by state and municipal plaintiffs to \\nkeep the matters away from the federal court and ex-\\nclusively before state courts, EPA has obtained emails and handwritten and typewritten notes under public \\nrecords requests, further discussed below, that illus-\\ntrate the danger of allowing st ate courts to interfere in \\nthis way in lawful interstate commerce conducted un-\\nder the auspices of the federal government. Key among \\nthese public records are two sets of notes each purport-ing, independently, to record the assertion by a senior \\nState of Rhode Island official that the objective of its \\nlitigation was to obtain a \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d for the State\\u2019s spending ambitions, in the face of a leg-\\nislature that does not share the executive\\u2019s priorities. \\n Both sets of notes record that official as emphasiz-\\ning the use of state courts to  obtain this funding denied \\nthem by the legislature. Other records, also noted, in-\\nfra, record the plaintiff \\u2019s legal counsel\\u2019s team, at least \\nsome of whom also represent the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore in this litigation,\\n4 lobbying gov-\\nernmental officials to join the campaign emphasizing the strategy of advancing this cause in the \\u201cmore ad-vantageous venue for these cases,\\u201d which plaintiffs confess is to be had in state courts. \\n \\n 4 The California law firm Sher Edling LLP represents both \\nthe State of Rhode Island in the First Circuit and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore in the Fourth Circuit. \\n8 \\n  These public records obtained through state open \\nrecords laws by Amicus  EPA represent a Rhode Island \\n\\u201ccabinet\\u201d-level official confiding to peers that the \\nState\\u2019s elected representatives are insufficiently moved by the plaintiff \\u2019s requests to enact laws raising \\nthe revenues the State\\u2019s executive desires; and that it \\nis thus \\u201clooking for [a] sustainable funding stream,\\u201d having been reduced to \\u201csuing big oil\\u201d for its \\u201cPriority \\n\\u2013 sustainable funding stream .\\u201d Notably, both sets of \\nnotes capture the State of Rhode Island as having em-phasized the \\u201cstate court\\u201d aspect of its plan. \\n These records, representing a similarly-situated \\nplaintiff \\u2019s confession, as recorded identically by two by \\nothers in the comfort of a presumably candid and off-\\nthe-record private meeting with peers and funders of \\u201cclimate\\u201d activism, leave little doubt that this growing \\nwave of state court \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation seeks \\nat least two impermissible objectives. First, this type of litigation seeks to use (state) courts to effectively \\ncreate federal energy and environmental policy. Sec-\\nond, in addition to using litigation as a stand-in for \\nthe political process that has denied state and munic-\\nipal plaintiffs their desired policies, it seeks to use lit-\\nigation to raise revenues having be en denied them \\nwhere revenues would properly be raised, which \\nagain is by the po litical process. \\n These public records provide strong impetus to \\nacknowledge, as a formal matter, that this \\u201cclimate \\nnuisance\\u201d litigation campaign is an impermissible use of the courts, seeking the most favorable forum to ob-\\ntain political ends by judicial means; that when filed \\n9 \\n they must remain in federal court; and that they \\nshould be dismissed for the same reasons. \\n \\nIII. PUBLIC RECORDS OBTAINED BY PRO-\\nPOSED AMICUS CURIAE  AFFIRM THIS \\nCASE BELONGS IN FEDERAL COURT \\n Amicus  EPA has obtained public records from Col-\\norado State University\\u2019s Center for a New Energy Economy (\\u201cCNEE\\u201d) under the Colorado Open Records \\nAct (\\u201cCORA\\u201d). Those records have now been brought to \\nthe attention of the First Circuit in related litigation, and are proper subject for judic ial notice by this Court. \\nSee Fed. Rule Evid. 201(b)(2). The records pertain to a \\ntwo-day meeting in July 2019 hosted by the Rockefel-ler Brothers Fund (\\u201cRBF\\u201d) at the Rockefeller family \\nmansion at Pocantico, NY. They include numerous \\nemails, agendas and other materials. Most pertinent, they also include a set of handwritten notes and a sec-\\nond, corroborating set of typewritten notes. According \\nto the public records themselves, the former was pre-pared by attendee Carla Frisch of the Rocky Mountain \\nInstitute (\\u201cRMI\\u201d), and the latter by attendee Katie \\nMcCormack of the Energy Foundation.\\n5 \\n \\n 5 These are available, respectively, at https://climatelitigationwatch. \\norg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Carla-Frisch-handwritten-notes- EPA_CORA1505.pdf and https:// climatelitigationwatch.org/ \\nwp-content/uploads/2020/03/EF-Katie-McCormack-typed-notes-EPA_CORA1542.pdf. These documents are identified in an August \\n20, 2019 email from CNEE\\u2019s Patric k Cummins transmitting them \\nto RBF\\u2019s Michael Northrop, Subject: meeting highlights, available at https://climatelitigationwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ \\n \\n10 \\n  This was a private event, styled \\u201cAccelerating \\nState Action on Climate Change,\\u201d if hosted as a forum \\nfor policy activists and a major funder to coordinate \\nwith senior public employees, e.g., a governor\\u2019s chief of staff and department secretaries and their cabinet \\nequivalents from fifteen states. These states included \\nFirst Circuit Plaintiff the State of Rhode Island, repre-sented by its Director of the Department of Environ-\\nmental Management, Janet Coit.\\n6 \\n These notes purport to contemporaneously record \\nthe comments of Director Coit discussing Rhode Is-\\nland\\u2019s entry in this litigation campaign, among peers. One passage in each set of no tes, attributed to Director \\nCoit and replicated almost verbatim in both, is partic-\\nularly striking and relevant, affirming two points that have become obvious and which should inform key de-\\ncisions confronting the judiciary in this \\u201cclimate nui-\\nsance\\u201d litigation campaign. \\n The records show RMI\\u2019s Frisch recorded Director \\nCoit speaking to this litigation as shown in the below \\n \\nEdited-notes-transmittal-email-CSU-suggests-Snail-mail-probably- \\ncovered-EPA_CORA1481_Redacted.pdf. \\u201cRBF CNEE climate pol-icy notes Jul 17 18.docx\\u201d are Katie McCormack\\u2019s notes (Energy Foundation); these appear to be produced as document EPA_ CORA1542.pdf, derived from Ms. McCormick\\u2019s transmittal email \\nbeing 1541, in which she describes her notes as long, and 1542 consists of 18 pages of notes;  \\u201cXerox Scan_07222019155622.pdf \\u201d \\nare Carla Frisch\\u2019s handwritten notes (this was produced as docu-ment EPA_CORA1505.pdf ). \\n \\n6 The participant list is availabl e at https://climatelitigation-\\nwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/List-of-Attendees-EPA_ CORA1037.pdf. \\n11 \\n excerpted image (Ms. Frisch\\u2019s notes are available in \\nfull at https://climatelitigationwatch.org/wp-content/ \\nuploads/2020/03/Carla-Frisch-handwritten-notes-EPA_ \\nCORA1505.pdf ). Ms. Frisch recorded Director Coit as saying, about this suit: \\nRI \\u2013 Gen Assembly D but doesn\\u2019t care on env/climate \\nlooking for sustainable funding stream \\nsuing big oil for RI damages in state court \\n \\n The first line-item attributes to Director Coit the \\nposition that the Rhode Island legislature is not per-suaded of the claims set fort h by the State in its litiga-\\ntion. This reluctance to politically impose the revenue-\\nraising measures (taxes) necessary for such funding streams is inherently shared among all \\u201cclimate nui-\\nsance\\u201d plaintiffs. The excerp t appears to also reflect \\nDirector Coit\\u2019s view of why the Rhode Island legisla-ture has thereby declined to obtain from the taxpayer, \\n\\n12 \\n and then appropriate to the State, the revenue streams \\nthat governmental Plaintiff Rhode Island desires. \\n This entry on its face represents a senior official \\nconfessing that Rhode Island\\u2019s climate litigation, es-\\nsentially identical to that in the Baltimore case below, \\nis in fact a product of Rhode Island\\u2019s elected represent-atives lacking enthusiasm for politically enacting cer-\\ntain policies, including reve nue measures, thus leaving \\nthe state \\u201clooking for [a] sustainable funding stream,\\u201d and so \\u201csuing big oil.\\u201d This characterizes all such gov-\\nernmental plaintiffs and su its including the matter \\nin the Fourth Circuit case which is the subject of the \\nPetition in this matter. \\n Fortunately, we can be confident that Ms. Frisch \\ndid not mishear Director Coit. The Energy Foundation\\u2019s \\nKatie McCormack provided RBF with a typewritten \\nset of her own notes transcribing the proceedings. To this Court\\u2019s further benefit, Ms. McCormack\\u2019s type-\\nwritten transcription of Director Coit\\u2019s commentary \\nreads almost verbatim as Ms. Frisch\\u2019s. \\n Ms. McCormack recorded Di rector Coit as saying: \\n* Assembly very conservative leadership \\u2013 don\\u2019t \\ncare about env\\u2019t \\n* If care, put it in the budget \\n* Priority \\u2013 sustainable funding stream * State court against oil/gas \\n13 \\n  \\n These notes on their face both affirm two realities \\nthat have become inescapable in recent years about this epidemic of \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation, all chan-neled into state courts (aft er the first generation of \\nsuits floundered in federal co urt, and ultimately were \\nterminated by this Court in American Electric Power v. \\nConnecticut , 131 S. Ct. 2527, 2539, 564 U.S. 410, 426 \\n(2011)).\\n7 That is that these suits seek to use the courts \\nto stand in for policymakers on two fronts. First, these suits ask the courts to substitute their authority for that of the political branches of government on matters of policy. Second, these suits seek billions of dollars in revenues, again the province of the political branches, for distribution toward political uses and constituen-cies. \\n O n  t h a t  fi r s t  c o u n t  o f  policymaking through the \\ncourts, the RBF meeting notes ratify a comment made to The Nation magazine by the plaintiffs\\u2019 tort lawyer credited with inventing this wave of litigation, Matt \\n \\n 7 See, e.g., Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp ., \\n663 F.Supp.2d 863 (N.D. Cal. 2009), upheld at  696 F.3d 849 (9th \\nCir. 2012). \\n\\n14 \\n Pawa. The magazine wrote, \\u201cAt the end of his speech, \\nSenator [Sheldon] Whitehouse [of Rhode Island] re-minded his colleagues of their \\u2018legislative responsibil-ity to address climate change.\\u2019 But it\\u2019s clear that too many lawmakers have abdicated, thus the pressure to tackle the climate issue thro ugh existing regulations \\nlike the Clean Air Act, and through the courts. \\u2018I\\u2019ve been hearing for twelve years or more that legislation is right around the corner that\\u2019s going to solve the global-warming problem, and that litigation is too long, difficult, and arduous a path,\\u2019 said Matthew Pawa, a climate attorney. \\u2018Legislation is going nowhere, so liti-gation could potentially play an important role.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n8 \\n Such use of the courts is of course improper but \\nalso informs a conclusion that these cases, when \\nbrought, belong in federal cour t, as well as that they \\nshould be dismissed for reasons including the inher-\\nently obvious, and now repeatedly confessed, purpose. \\n The second conclusion affirmed by these twice-\\nsourced assertions by the First Circuit plaintiffs is that \\nthis type of litigation is a grab for revenues, which again must properly be purs ued through the political \\nprocess. This is related to the first, in that, like policy, \\nsuch revenue-raising measures must be enacted by the voters\\u2019 elected representatives or approved directly by \\nvoters. Instead, with the desire for more \\u201cfunding \\nstreams\\u201d being yet another way the political process \\n \\n 8 Zoe Carpenter, The Government May Already Have the \\nLaw It Needs to Beat Big Oil , The Nation (July 15, 2015), \\nhttps://www.thenation.com/article/the-government-may-already-have-the-law-it-needs-to-beat-big-oil/. \\n15 \\n has failed such plaintiffs, we see them circumventing \\nthat process through this litigation campaign. \\n That the desire for more governmental revenue, \\nwithout adopting the necessa ry direct taxes for which \\nthere can be a political price to pay, was behind such \\nlitigation was suggested by the U.S. Chamber of Com-merce in a 2019 report enti tled \\u201cMitigating Munici-\\npality Litigation: Scope and Solutions,\\u201d published by \\nthe Chamber\\u2019s Institute fo r Legal Reform. That re-\\nport highlighted: \\n* \\u201cFor instance, local government leaders may \\neye the prospect of significant recoveries as a \\nmeans of making up for budget shortfalls.\\u201d \\n* \\u201cLarge settlements like those produced in the \\ntobacco litigation are alluring to municipali-\\nties facing budget constraints.\\u201d \\n* \\u201cSevere, persistent municipal budget con-\\nstraints have coincided with the rise of munic-ipal litigation agains t opioid manufacturers \\nas local governments are promised large re-\\ncoveries with no risk to municipal budgets by contingency fee trial lawyers.\\u201d \\n* \\u201cConclusion  A convergence of factors is propelling munici-\\npalities to file affirmative lawsuits against corporate entities. \\n There is the \\u2018push\\u2019 factor: municipalities face \\nhistoric budgetary cons traints and a public \\ninundated with news reports on the opioid cri-\\nsis, rising sea levels, and data breaches. And \\n16 \\n there is the \\u2018pull\\u2019 of potential multimillion-\\ndollar settlements and low-cost, contingency \\nfee trial lawyers. As a consequence, munici-\\npalities are pivoting to the courts by the thou-\\nsands.\\u201d9 \\n The National Association of Manufacturers\\u2019 Cen-\\nter for Legal Action has similarly argued that, \\u201cThe \\ntowns and lawyers have said that this litigation is \\nsolely about money. The towns want funding for local projects, and their lawyers are working on a contin-\\ngency fee basis, which means they aren\\u2019t paid if they \\ndon\\u2019t win.\\u201d\\n10 \\n The records EPA has obtained now provide docu-\\nmentary evidence to support these concerns that the courts are being exploited to balance municipal/state \\nbudgets and make policy decisions that legislators \\nhave declined to make. \\n \\n  \\n \\n 9 United States Chamber of Co mmerce, \\u201cMitigating Munici-\\npality Litigation: Scope and Solutions,\\u201d U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, March 2019, h ttps://www.instituteforlegalre-\\nform.com/uploads/sites/1/Mitigating-Municipality-Litigation-2019- Research.pdf, at p. 1, 6, 7 and 18, respectively. \\n \\n10 Manufacturers\\u2019 Accountability Project, \\u201cBeyond the Court-\\nroom: Climate Liability Litigation in the United States,\\u201d p. 2, https://mfgaccountabilityproject.or g/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ \\nMAP-Beyond-the-Courtroom-Chapter-One.pdf \\n17 \\n IV. HISTORIC CONCERNS ABOUT STATE \\nCOURT BIAS ARE AMPLIFIED IN CASES \\nOF THIS TYPE, SUCH THAT FEDERAL \\nCOURTS SHOULD STEP IN TO PROTECT \\nFEDERAL INTERESTS \\n A \\u201chistoric concern about state court bias\\u201d is the \\nunderlying basis allowing for federal officer removal. \\nSavoie v. Huntington Ingalls, Inc. , 817 F.3d 457, 461 \\n(5th Cir. 2016). The Supreme Court also recognizes bias as a concern justifying removal to federal court. \\n\\u201cState-court proceedings may reflect \\u2018local prejudice\\u2019 \\nagainst unpopular federal laws or federal officials.\\u201d Watson v. Philip Morris Cos. , 551 U.S. 142, 150 (2007). \\nBias exists, as these opinions acknowledge, and there \\nis no rational basis for declaring that such bias extends only to parties who are unpopular government offi-\\ncials. Indeed, this Court has  cautioned against \\u201cnarrow, \\ngrudging interpretation\\u201d of federal officer removal. Willingham v. Morgan , 395 U.S. 402, 407 (1969). \\nSimply put, \\u201c[t]he removal statute is an incident of fed-\\neral supremacy.\\u201d Murray v. Murray , 621 F.2d 103, 106 \\n(5th Cir. 1980). \\n States and municipalities are engaged in a cam-\\npaign through the courts to overturn \\u201cunpopular fed-\\neral laws.\\u201d Rather than recognizing the Constitution \\nand federal laws as supreme, governmental \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d plaintiffs are applying \\u201cnarrow, grudging\\u201d \\ninterpretation of the removal statute to seek to over-\\nturn federal law through imposing ostensible tort lia-bility in state courts. \\n18 \\n  It is hard to imagine a more striking case where \\nfear of state court bias could be a concern than is pre-\\nsented in the instant matter and similar cases unfold-\\ning across the nation. Stated otherwise and even more affirmatively, the hope  for state court bias is demon-\\nstrably at play in these case s, as shown in other records \\nobtained by Amicus  EPA through public records laws. \\n As documented, supra , by its own admission the \\nState of Rhode Island is pursuing its litigation to ob-tain a \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d for its officials\\u2019 \\nspending ambitions, having failed to convince the vot-\\ners\\u2019 elected representatives to provide one. Rhode Is-land\\u2019s circumstance in this respect differs not at all \\nfrom all such plaintiffs including in Baltimore . Both \\nsets of notes discussed, supra , specify Director Coit\\u2019s \\nemphasis on seeking this \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d \\nin \\u201cstate court.\\u201d All such plaintiffs are now moving \\nHeaven and earth to keep these matters out of the clutches of federal jurisdiction. \\n This objective of suing to make federal policy in \\nstate courts is a thematic cousin of the drive to use the \\ncourts when legislatures fail to enact plaintiffs\\u2019 desired \\npolicies, and is well-understood among the instant plaintiffs, Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, and by \\nthe legal teams for most similarly-situated govern-\\nment plaintiffs. That Rhode Island and the City of Bal-timore share not only claims and legal strategies but \\nlegal counsel, whose recruit ing team has emphasized \\nto targeted governmental entities the desire to keep these matters in state court as the \\u201cmore advantageous \\nvenue for these cases,\\u201d given this Court\\u2019s ruling in \\n19 \\n American Electric Power , raises concerns that the cli-\\nmate nuisance plaintiffs also  share the hope for state \\ncourt biases in the campaign to eliminate budgetary \\nshortfalls and otherwise make policy through tort liti-gation. \\n For example, and again turning to documents ob-\\ntained through open records laws, we see that, after \\nU.S. District Judge William Alsup dismissed the City \\nof Oakland\\u2019s \\u201cclimate nuisanc e\\u201d suit against many of \\nthe same defendants in June 2018,\\n11 a lobbyist hired to \\nassist with recruiting more governmental plaintiffs for \\nSher Edling12 passed along a note of encouragement to \\n \\n 11 City of Oakland, et al. v.

G. Seth \\nPlatt is one of the network\\u2019s cons ultants, engaged to help lobby \\nFlorida municipalities to file suit similar to the State\\u2019s. At the time of the correspondence cited herein, Platt was a registered lobbyist for the Institute for Gove rnance & Sustainable Development \\n(\\u201cIGSD\\u201d) (www.igsd.org) (see search able index of lobbying regis-\\ntrations at ftlweb01app.azurewebsites.us/Ethicstrac/Lobbyists.aspx). Platt worked with IGSD and others  pitching municipalities to file \\n\\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation against energy interests, with First Circuit and Fourth Circuit plaintiffs\\u2019 counsel Sher Edling. \\n On July 27, 2018 Fort Lauderdale Interim City Attorney \\nAlain Boileau wrote Mayor Dean Trantalis, copying other aides, in pertinent part: \\n\\u201cMayor . . .

While recruiting Fort Lauderdale to file a climate nuisance action similar to the instant matter, Platt of-\\nfered \\u201ccontext for Dean and Alain\\u2019s consideration\\u201d in an email to Mayor Dean Trantalis, City Atto rney Boileau, and Mayor\\u2019s Chief \\nof Staff Scott Wyman. This was specifically in response to U.S. District Judge Alsup\\u2019s June 2018 opinion dismissing certain mu-\\nnicipalities\\u2019 \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation on the grounds that the courts were not the proper place to deal with such global issues.  \\n In another email, City Attorney Alan Boileau writes to \\nMayor Trantalis, \\u201cThe governmental plaintiffs are essentially pursuing liability through common law claims at a local level for a global (and not exclusively do mestic) problem upon which the \\njudiciary is taking the position that the issue has been and should be relegated to the exec utive and legislative branches. \\nhttps://climatelitigationwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ CLK_789_2018-Em ails-2nd-FTL-Production.pdf. \\n \\n15 Matt Dempsey, \\u201cUCLA Professor\\u2019 s Role In Climate Litiga-\\ntion Raises Transparency Questions,\\u201d Western Wire, November 27, 2018, https://westernwire.net/u cla-professors-role-in-climate-\\nlitigation-raises-transparency-questions/. \\n \\n16 \\u201c \\u2018[U.S. District Judge William Alsup\\u2019s] decision is irrele-\\nvant from a legal perspective,\\u2019 Carlson said, as long as these cases stay in state courts.

(\\u201cLDF\\u201d) has strived to secure \\nthe constitutional promise of equality for all people. Petitioner asks the Court to reconsider an important question about the Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s reach, which, more than any other constitutional provision, \\nembodies our Nation\\u2019s commitment to equal justice \\nunder the law.  \\nLDF has been at the forefront of efforts to enforce \\nthe Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s promise of equality. See, e.g. , Cooper v. Aaron , 358 U.S. 1 (1958);\\n Brown v. \\nBd. of Educ. of Topeka , 347 U.S. 483 (1954) . LDF has \\nalso led the fight of eradicating discrimination from jury verdicts. See, e.g. , Ham v. South Carolina , 409 \\nU.S. 524 (1973)\\n; Alexander v. Louisiana , 405 U.S. 625 \\n(1972) ; Swain v. Alabama , 380 U.S. 202 (1965). \\nLDF submits this brief to aid the Court in \\ndeciding whether the Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s Due Process Clause incorporates the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement against the States.\\n1  \\n  \\n                                                \\n1 Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.6, counsel for amicus \\ncuriae state that no counsel for a party authored this brief in \\nwhole or in part and that no person other than amicus curiae , its \\nmembers, or its counsel made a monetary contribution to the preparation or submission of this brief. All parties have consented to the filing of this brief. \\n2 \\n \\n SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \\nAfter the Civil War, Congress passed the \\nFourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of \\n1875 to protect the rights of newly freed African \\nAmericans. One of the rights protected by those provisions was the right to  serve on a jury. Indeed, \\nthis Court affirmed the centrality of jury service to the citizenship of African Americans 140 years ago. See \\nStrauder v. West Virginia , 100 U.S. 303 (1879). \\nThen, in 1898, white Louisianans convened a \\nconstitutional convention. Their goal was to craft a constitution that would \\u201cestablish the supremacy of \\nthe white race . . . to the extent to which it could be \\nlegally and constitutionally done . . . .\\u201d Louisiana \\nratified its non-unanimous jury provision at this convention to help achieve its goal of cementing white supremacy. While federal law made it illegal to exclude Black people from jury service, the delegates \\npassed the non-unanimous jury provision to nullify \\nthe votes of Black jurors and allow white jurors to more easily convict Black defendants. \\nLouisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury provision \\nworked exactly as intended. Up until 2018, when \\nLouisianans voted to remove the non-unanimous jury \\nprovision from their constitution, Black defendants were more likely to be convicted by non-unanimous juries than white defendants, and Black jurors were more likely than white jurors to be in the dissent. \\nThus, despite jury service being a hallmark of \\nAmerican citizenship, for ov er a century, Louisiana\\u2019s \\n3 \\n \\n non-unanimous jury provision effectively undermined \\nBlack participation on juries. \\nLouisiana has been permitted to thwart the \\nintent of the Reconstruction Congress in this manner because of this Court\\u2019s decision in Apodaca v. Oregon , \\n406 U.S. 404 (1972), in which Justice Powell\\u2019s idiosyncratic view that the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement does not apply to the States \\nwas the controlling opinion. Th is is the rare case in \\nwhich stare decisis should not control, and this Court \\nshould hold that the Sixth Amendment requires state juries\\u2014like federal juries\\u2014to be unanimous. \\nARGUMENT \\nI. THE HISTORY OF THE FOURTEENTH \\nAMENDMENT COMPELS THE INCORPORATION OF THE SIXTH AMENDMENT UNANIMOUS JURY TRIAL \\nRIGHT.  \\nThis Court recently reiterated that \\u201c[a] Bill of \\nRights protection is inco rporated . . . if it is \\n\\u2018fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty,\\u2019 or \\n\\u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\\u2019s history and tradition.\\u2019\\u201d  \\nTimbs v. Indiana , 139 S. Ct. 682, 687 (2019) (quoting \\nMcDonald v. Chicago , 561 U.S. 742, 767 (2010)). \\nAccordingly, when determining whether a provision of the Bill of Rights is \\u201cfundamental\\u201d or \\u201cdeeply rooted,\\u201d the Court reckons with the historical context \\nof the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e.g. , McDonald , \\n561 U.S. at 770-78 (explicating the position of \\u201cthe \\n4 \\n \\n Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth \\nAmendment\\u201d); id. at 776 (relying on \\u201c[e]vidence from \\nthe period immediately following the ratification of \\nthe Fourteenth Amendment\\u201d); Timbs , 139 S. Ct. at \\n688 (same). An examination of this history compels the incorporation of the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement. \\nIn the aftermath of the Civil War, Southern \\nwhites were neither prepared nor willing to accept the \\n\\u201cfundamentally altered . . . racial status quo in the \\nSouth.\\u201d\\n2 The Thirteenth Amendment\\u2019s ratification \\nabolished slavery in 1865.3 Nevertheless, recalcitrant \\nSouthern states persisted in \\u201csubjugat[ing] newly \\nfreed slaves and maintain[ing] the prewar racial \\nhierarchy.\\u201d Timbs , 139 S. Ct. at 688. Between  1865 \\nand 1866, Southern legislatures accomplished this by passing discriminatory statutes, known as Black \\nCodes, which \\u201creduce[d] blacks to a status somewhere \\nbetween that of slaves (which they no longer were) \\nand full free people (which most white southerners opposed).\\u201d\\n4 And Black Codes governed a wide range of \\naspects of everyday life, including the extent of African American access to the courtroom.\\n5 For \\n                                                \\n2 Paul Finkelman, John Bingham and the Background to the \\nFourteenth Amendment , 36 Akron L.

Pol. & Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 389, 402-03 \\n5 \\n \\n example, under the Alabama Black Code, while Black \\npeople were allowed to testify in court, they were limited to testifying \\u201conly in cases in which freedmen, \\nfree negroes and mulattoes are parties.\\u201d\\n6  Other \\nstates passed similar Black Codes, all of which had the same effect: Black people could not testify in civil \\ncases between white people or in criminal cases in \\nwhich a white person harmed another white person.\\n7  \\n\\u201c[T]he law in effect declared that blacks were not \\n\\u2018equal\\u2019 to whites and that their testimony was not as \\u2018good\\u2019 as that of whites.\\u201d\\n8 \\nIt was against this backdrop of state-legislated \\nrefusal \\u201cto accept that the freed people were entitled \\nto liberty, equality, or even fundamental legal \\nrights,\\u201d9 that the need for Congress to create legal \\nprotections for formerly enslaved African Americans \\nbecame clear. In December 1865, Congress created \\nthe Joint Committee on Reconstruction, and \\nauthorized the Committee \\u201cto investigate conditions \\nin the South.\\u201d10  \\nThis investigation showed that with respect to \\nformerly enslaved Black people, \\u201cit was impossible to abandon them, without securing them their rights as \\n                                                \\n(2004).

As this Court said in Duncan v. Louisiana , \\u201c[t]he \\nguarantees of jury trial . . . reflect a profound \\njudgment about the way in which law should be enforced and justice administered.\\u201d 391 U.S. 145, 155 (1968).

Because of its long-\\nunderstood importance,\\n26 the right to jury trial was \\n                                                \\n23 Albert W. Alschuler & Andrew G.

The story of two Black Louisianans who recently served as jurors\\u2014Willie Newton and Bobbie Howard\\u2014compellingly illustrates this point.\\n64 \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard were both born and \\nraised in the small town of Houma, in Terrebonne Parish; the same town where Evangelisto Ramos \\nworked. Mr. Newton, who is 72 years old, runs a \\nfamily business selling burial vaults.

Everything quoted is from their interviews with counsel unless attributed otherwise. \\n19 \\n \\n year-old Mr. Howard has his own accounting practice. \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard both attended segregated schools growing up. In fact, they went to \\nthe same high school, as there was only one in the \\nParish that educated Black children. \\nIn 2014, two years before Mr. Ramos faced trial \\nfor second-degree murder, Mr. Newton and Mr. Howard were selected to serve on the jury for the trial \\nof Matthew Allen, a 20-year-old Black man also \\naccused of second-degree murder. The prosecution\\u2019s \\ntheory was that Mr. Allen intentionally shot and killed the victim; Mr. Allen\\u2019 s defense to the charge \\nwas that he acted in self-defense.\\n65 Mr. Newton and \\nMr. Howard were the only Black jurors. The other ten \\njurors on Mr. Allen\\u2019s jury were white.  \\nMr. Newton vividly recalled  his feelings when he \\nsaw the jury\\u2019s composition: \\u201cBobby and I saw from the beginning that our vote wasn\\u2019t going to matter. We \\nwere outnumbered.\\u201d \\u201cI could have just stayed home.\\u201d \\n\\u201cAin\\u2019t no difference we can make.\\u201d Mr. Newton felt \\ndoubly distraught when he saw that Mr. Allen had a \\u201cbad judge\\u201d who had been reprimanded for wearing blackface.\\n66 Mr. Newton thought to himself, \\u201cBuddy, \\nyou\\u2019re doomed.\\u201d \\n                                                \\n65 See State v. Allen , 2015-0675, 2015 WL 6951570, at *2 (La. Ct. \\nApp. 2015).  \\n66 In 2004, Judge Timothy Ellender was suspended for wearing \\nblackface, handcuffs, and a jail jumpsuit to a Halloween party.  \\nSee Seth Fox, Houma Judge Suspended for Wearing Blackface \\nHalloween Costume , Houma Today (Dec. 13, 2014), \\n20 \\n \\n Reflecting back, Mr. Newton and Mr. Howard \\nthought Mr. Allen\\u2019s race worked against him with the white jurors. \\u201cThey see a Black defendant in a drug \\ndeal and maybe think \\u2018he\\u2019s hustling corner to corner, \\nlet\\u2019s teach him a lesson,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Howard speculated. Mr. Newton echoed this sentiment: \\u201cI think they saw him \\nas a potential threat to the community.\\u201d  \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard looked at Mr. Allen \\ndifferently. They saw a young man who may have \\nmade a mistake, but who still had a life ahead of him. \\nMr. Howard thought these differing perspectives could be due to the fact \\u201ctheir life experiences were different.\\u201d  \\nAfter listening intently to the evidence, both Mr. \\nHoward and Newton favored finding Mr. Allen guilty of manslaughter. \\u201cI thought about his age. I thought he deserved a second chance,\\u201d Mr. Howard said quietly. Mr. Newton confirmed that he \\u201cnever thought \\nit was second-degree murder\\u201d and proposed to his \\nfellow jurors that Mr. Allen should be convicted of \\nmanslaughter, not murder.  \\nDeliberations gave both men hope that at least \\nsome of the white jurors would see the evidence their \\nway and would find Mr. Allen guilty of manslaughter, \\nnot murder. Mr. Howard recalled that one juror, a white woman, seemed to be leaning in favor of manslaughter going into lunch. Mr. Newton remembered there being two or three white jurors \\n                                                \\nhttps://www.houmatoday.com/article/DA/20041213/News/60809\\n9465/HC/.   \\n21 \\n \\n who seemed to think manslaughter was the just \\nconviction. \\nThings took a turn after lunch, however. Mr. \\nHoward recounted that he and Mr. Newton had lunch together, while the white jurors ate together. When they returned from lunch, all ten white jurors wanted to vote for second-degree murder; there was no convincing them otherwise, \\u201ceveryone was set in their \\nways.\\u201d  \\nMr. Newton\\u2019s prediction that his vote wouldn\\u2019t \\nmatter proved prescient. Th e jury convicted Mr. Allen \\nof second-degree murder by a vote of 10-2. All ten \\nwhite jurors voted for guilt. Mr. Newton and Mr. \\nHoward voted not guilty. \\nWhat took place troubled Mr. Howard and Mr. \\nNewton. Mr. Howard recalled: \\u201cI pretty much felt sorry for the young man, to tell you the truth.\\u201d Mr. \\nNewton was more shaken: \\u201cIt hurt me real bad when \\nI looked at that young man, and I looked at his mother and father, and I knew they weren\\u2019t going to see him again, not unless they go up to Angola.\\u201d\\n67 Indeed, Mr. \\nNewton felt the effects of the trial long after it was \\nover: \\u201cWhen I left that jury, it took me a couple of \\nweeks to get myself together. Serving on that jury \\ntook something out of me.\\u201d Mr. Allen, who entered prison for a crime he a when he was only 20, continues to serve a life sentence in Angola Prison.   \\n                                                \\n67 Adelson et al., supra note 57. \\n22 \\n \\n Mr. Newton realized that what happened in Mr. \\nAllen\\u2019s trial probably happened in many others, causing him to wonder, \\u201cHow many others had passed \\nthis way . . . and got the same treatment this boy got.\\u201d \\nThe trial, Mr. Newton explained, made him feel like his \\u201cvoice didn\\u2019t matter,\\u201d \\u201ca second-class citizen.\\u201d  \\nThis experience confirmed for Mr. Newton that \\nLouisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury system was unfair to \\nBlack defendants and Black jurors. In his opinion, the \\nprosecutors \\u201cfound a way to get around the system\\u201d \\nby limiting the number of Black people on Mr. Allen\\u2019s jury to two, knowing they only needed ten votes for a conviction. The trial shook Mr. Newton\\u2019s confidence in \\nthe fairness of Louisiana\\u2019s justice system: \\u201cI know I \\ncouldn\\u2019t sit there and think I\\u2019d get a fair trial.\\u201d  \\nMr. Newton took solace in the fact Louisiana \\nvoters repealed the non-unanimous jury provision last year.\\n68 He expressed that while he does think that \\n\\u201cjustice was served\\u201d during Mr. Allen\\u2019s trial, he felt \\n\\u201cencouraged\\u201d and \\u201cempowered\\u201d to serve on a jury now that his vote was guaranteed to matter. Mr. Howard \\nsaid that he, too, is ready to perform his \\u201ccivic duty\\u201d \\nand serve on a jury under Louisiana\\u2019s new unanimous jury scheme.  \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard\\u2019s experience is a \\nstark example of the indign ities inflicted upon Black \\npeople by Louisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury provision. It is a reminder that, until last year, Louisiana\\u2019s non-\\nunanimous jury system worked the way its racist \\n                                                \\n68 Oregon is now the only state with a non-unanimous jury \\nprovision. \\n23 \\n \\n proponents intended\\u2014to more easily convict Black \\ndefendants and to silence Black jurors.

While debating the extent to \\nwhich the Constitution should enshrine protections for religious freedom during the First Congress, \\nRepresentative Daniel Carroll of Maryland\\u2014one of \\nthe few Catholics among the Constitution\\u2019s \\nFramers\\u2014remarked \\u201cthe rights of conscience are, in \\ntheir nature, of peculiar delicacy, and will little bear \\nthe gentlest touch of governmental hand.\\u201d 1 Annals \\nof Cong. 757-58 (Joseph Gales ed., 1834) (Aug. 15, 1789). \\nNowhere are the rights of the religious more \\ndelicate than when they intersect with the freedom \\nto put faith into action, belief into words. If the \\nrobust religious freedom protections guaranteed by \\nour Constitution are to have any meaning, they must \\nbe capable of shielding a sincere religious believer from being coerced into speaking against the core \\ntenants of her faith. To hold otherwise would be to \\npermit the heavy hand of government to extinguish \\nreligious practice. This the Constitution will not \\nallow. \\nThe Founders understood that the First \\nAmendment, as drafted, protected all religious sects in their right to speak freely in accordance with their \\nfaith. Indeed, the Founding Generation believed \\nprotections for religious lib erty to be of utmost \\nimport. Since its founding, America has been gripped \\n 3 \\nin debate over religious liberty. Even before the \\ncolonies declared their independence, there were \\nenergetic discussions over the bounds of religious \\ntoleration versus a full freedom to exercise religion \\n(with only limited exceptions). Ultimately, the \\nConstitution\\u2019s drafters settled on James Madison\\u2019s \\nview of an unalienable right to practice one\\u2019s \\nreligious faith. Owed to an understanding that the Governor of the Universe supersedes any earthly \\nauthority, religious convictions were understood to \\ncommand greater deference than mere personal \\nopinions. Where opinion was required to yield to the \\nlaw, tensions between law and religious belief often \\nresulted in exemption for the believer. \\nThe Founding Generation also viewed religious \\nliberty as encompassing more  than mere matters of \\nconscience or decisions on the rightness or wrongness \\nof acts. Instead, the full ex ercise of religion offered a \\nright to act in accordance with one\\u2019s faith and, \\nnecessarily, included protection from government \\ncompelled speech that violated a believer\\u2019s firmly \\nheld religious convictions. This distinction was \\nperhaps most clearly expressed in the early colonies\\u2019 \\nanti-Catholic prejudices. In colonial Georgia, for example, while all worshipers were vested by its \\nCharter with a liberty of conscience, Catholics were \\nexpressly excluded from protections for the more \\nrobust free exercise of religion. McConnell, The \\nOrigins and Historical Understanding of Free \\nExercise of Religion, 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1409, 1489-90 \\n(1989) (hereinafter McConnell, Origins). \\nInformed by the debates and experiences of their \\ntime, the Founders opted to include among the Constitution\\u2019s protections the more extensive free \\n 4 \\nexercise of religion. In so doing, they extended the \\nmaximum protections available to all who professed \\nbelief in a Universal Sovereign. These protections, it \\nwas understood, included a right to act out belief and \\nto speak, or refrain from speaking, freely, in \\naccordance with faith. \\nWith this understanding as background, it is \\nclear the First Amendment provides dual protections for religious expression (or non-expression) in its \\nguarantees of free speech and free religious exercise. \\nThis reality compels the \",\n          \" \\n No. 19-1189 \\n================================================================================================================ \\nIn The \\nSupreme Court of the United States \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 --------------------------------- \\nBP P.L.C., et al., \\nPetitioners,        \\nv. \\nMAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE, \\nRespondent.        \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 --------------------------------- \\nOn Petition For Writ Of Certiorari \\nTo The United States Court Of Appeals \\nFor The Fourth Circuit  \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 --------------------------------- \\nBRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE  \\nENERGY POLICY ADVOCATES \\nIN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS \\nFILED BY CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 --------------------------------- \\nMATTHEW  D.

Religious observers have \\nwelcomed the relief from government oppression. No \\nlonger can religious believers be excluded solely \\nbecause of their religious identity. Free are the religious to express their religious views without fear \\nof government reprisal. This Court\\u2019s precedents have \\nbeen unequivocal: if government can achieve its \\nmeans without burdening religion, the Constitution \\nalmost always requires that it must. \\nAnother truism is derived from this Court\\u2019s \\nprecedents. When religious liberty concerns are coupled with free expression, the Constitution \\ndemands the most exacting scrutiny. That is because \\nthe First Amendment, as understood from the \\nFounding, provides special protection for the \\n 5 \\nreligious, their right to speak freely, and their right \\nto refrain from speaking. Distinct from pure \\ncommercial speech, religious speech demands a \\nhigher constitutional protection. That is why, to \\nAmicus Curiae\\u2019s knowledge, government compelled \\nreligious speech has never been held to survive strict \\nscrutiny. \\nAgainst this backdrop, the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s opinion \\ncannot stand. Although purporting to apply strict scrutiny, the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s analysis is rife with \\nflaws, each one fatal to the court\\u2019s conclusion. From \\nthe outset, the Tenth Circuit failed to recognize the \\npreferred status of Ms. Smith\\u2019s free speech rights, \\ngrounded as they are in her religious beliefs. This \\nfailure is only compounded by the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s lethargic narrow-tailoring analysis. Far from the \\nexacting analysis this Court requires, the Tenth \\nCircuit settles into a now familiar pattern to those of \\nfaith\\u2014ostracizing Ms. Smith from society because of \\nher religious identity. \\nOnce again, this Court must reverse yet another \\nassault on religious freedom by declaring that where, as here, free speech and religion intersect, \\nconstitutional protections are at their greatest. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 6 \\nARGUMENT \\nI. AS ORIGINALLY UNDERSTOOD , THE FIRST \\nAMENDMENT PROTECTED THE RIGHT OF THE \\nRELIGIOUS TO SPEAK AND TO REMAIN SILENT . \\nThe First Amendment is \\u201cunique in form among \\namendments to the Constitution.\\u201d2 It is drafted, not \\nas a grant of privileges or rights to the people, but as \\na disability on Congress\\u2019 ability to act. Report to the Attorney General, supra  note 2, at 15\\u201316. In its \\nentirety, the First Amendment reads: \\nCongress shall make no law respecting \\nan establishment of religion, or \\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; or \\nabridging the freedom of speech, or of \\nthe press; or the right of the people \\npeaceably to assemble, and to petition \\nthe Government for a redress of grievances.  \\nU.S.\\n Const., Amdt. 1. \\nIn barring certain kinds of laws, the First \\nAmendment recognizes a pre-existing \\u201cimmun[ity] from such legislative action.\\u201d Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral, supra note 2, at 16. This reflects an \\nunderstanding by the Founding Generation that these \\u201care pre-existent rights\\u2014inalienable rights\\u2014\\n                                           \\n2 O f f i c e  o f  L e g a l  P o l i c y ,  D e p t  o f  J u s t i c e ,  R e p o r t  t o  t h e  \\nAttorney General: Religious Li berty Under the Free Exercise \\nClause at 15 (1986) (hereinafter Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral). \\n 7 \\nand not mere civil privileges conferred by a \\nbenevolent sovereign.\\u201d Id. \\nTaken together, the text, history, and philosophy \\nof the First Amendment establish the principle that \\n\\u201cthe government has no right to interfere with the \\nfree exercise of religion\\u201d unless the \\u201cgovernment \\naction is necessary to prevent manifest danger to the \\nexistence of the state; to protect public peace, safety, \\nand order; or to secure the religious liberty of \\nothers.\\u201d Id., at v. And, even then, only if the \\ngovernment deploys \\u201cthe least restrictive means \\nnecessary to protect these interests.\\u201d Id. This is true \\nas a matter of the First Amendment\\u2019s Religious Liberty Clauses. And because freedom of religion \\ncannot be divorced from freedom of expression, it is \\neven more true when the government tries to force a \\nbeliever to speak in a way that cannot be reconciled \\nwith her religious convictions. \\nA. Religious liberty was profoundly \\nimportant to the Founding Generation; \\nreligious convictions were understood \\nto receive greater deference than mere \\npersonal opinion. \\n1. The Founding Generation was uniquely \\nattuned to issues regarding the proper relationship \\nbetween religion and government. Indeed, at the time of America\\u2019s founding there was \\u201can intense and \\ncontroversial theoretical debate\\u201d of these issues \\ninvolving \\u201c[m]ost of the great political thinkers of the \\nperiod.\\u201d McConnell, Origins, at 1430. These thinkers \\ninformed the Founders\\u2019 own debates on the issue and \\nundoubtedly \\u201cinfluenced the American solution to \\nthe problem.\\u201d Id.  \\n 8 \\nJohn Locke, perhaps more than any other \\nphilosopher who contributed to the ideas \\nunderpinning America\\u2019s founding, provided the \\n\\u201cmost extensive\\u201d discussion of religion and most \\ndirectly influenced the Framers\\u2019 drafting of the First \\nAmendment. Id. Locke was an early and influential \\ntheoretical thinker and advocate for religious freedom. Id., at 1431. In his view \\u201creligious rivalry \\nand intolerance\\u201d were \\u201camong the most important of political problems,\\u201d and \\u201c[r]eligious intolerance was inconsistent both with public peace and with good \\ngovernment.\\u201d Id. \\nLocke\\u2019s solution, however, was an \\u201cunderstanding \\nof religious toleration,\\u201d that \\u201cexpressly precludes free \\nexercise exemptions.\\u201d Id., at 1435. To Locke, when \\n\\u201cindividual conscience conflicts with the governmental policy, the government will always \\nprevail and the individual will always be forced to \\nsubmit or suffer the punishment.\\u201d Id. Locke\\u2019s \\ninfluence on the drafters of the First Amendment makes it all the more remarkable that his view did \\nnot triumph with America\\u2019s founding. \\nThe American Revolution upended the \\npreexisting relationship between religion and government, especially in states where the Anglican \\nChurch had the most influence. Id., at 1436. \\n\\u201cAmerica was in the wake of a great religious \\nrevival,\\u201d that brought with it a \\u201cdrive for religious \\nfreedom.\\u201d Id., at 1437\\u201338. Along with this drive came \\na push from \\u201creligious supporters of disestablishment and free exercise\\u201d to enshrine \\n\\u201cconstitutional protections\\u201d for religious freedoms \\u201cat the federal level.\\u201d Id., at 1440. \\n 9 \\nThis movement was encapsulated in debate \\nsurrounding the religious liberty clause in Virginia\\u2019s \\n1776 Bill of Rights. When George Mason proposed \\nusing the Lockean phrase \\u201ctoleration of religion,\\u201d \\nJames Madison objected, complaining that the \\nphrase implied an act of legislative grace (which, to \\nLocke, it did). Id. , at 1443. Madison was not alone \\namong the Founding Generation in rejecting this concept. George Washin gton and Thomas Paine \\nsimilarly eschewed \\u201ctoleration,\\u201d decrying its \\nimplication of government \\u201cindulgence\\u201d rather than a \\nfundamental, preexisting right. Id., at 1443\\u201344. \\nMoreover, Madison objected to Mason\\u2019s proposal \\nbecause it excepted from even the \\u201ctoleration\\u201d of \\nreligious freedom any instance where \\u201cunder color of \\nreligion any man disturb the peace, the happiness, or \\nsafety of society.\\u201d See G. Hunt, James Madison and \\nReligious Liberty, 1 Ann. Rep. Am. Hist. A. 163, 166 \\n(1901). It was Madison\\u2019s belief that such phrasing \\n\\u201cmight easily be so twisted as to oppress religious \\nsects under the excuse that they disturbed \\u2018the \\npeace, the happiness, or safety of society.\\u2019\\u201d Id. \\nMadison\\u2019s objections were heard by Virginia\\u2019s \\nassembly. As adopted, Virginia\\u2019s Bill of Rights \\npromised that all \\u201care equally entitled to the free \\nexercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience,\\u201d and reminded only \\u201cthat\\n it is the mutual \\nduty of all to practice Christian forbearance, love, and charity towards each other.\\u201d Report to the \\nAttorney General, supra  note 2, at 102\\u201303. \\n2. This early debate between Madison and Mason \\nbears witness to what this Court has long noted\\u2014\\nthat Madison was \\u201cthe leading architect of the \\n 10\\nreligion clauses of the First Amendment.\\u201d Hosanna-\\nTabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v. \\nEEOC , 565 U.S. 171, 184 (2012) (internal quotation \\nmarks omitted). Madison\\u2019s rejection of religious \\ntolerance in favor of full and free religious expression permeates his Memorial and Remonstrance . \\nExplaining that \\u201c[t]he Religion then of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every \\nman,\\u201d Madison understood that it is not just \\u201cthe \\nright of every man to exercise it as these may \\ndictate,\\u201d but further \\u201cthe duty of every man to render \\nto the Creator such homage, and such only, as he \\nbelieves to be acceptable to him.\\u201d J. Madison, \\nMemorial and Remonstrance \\u00a7 1 (1785), reprinted in \\nEverson v. Bd. of Educ. , 330 U.S. 1, 64 (1947). This \\nright, Madison admonished, \\u201cis in its nature an unalienable right.\\u201d Id. \\nMadison expounded his view that \\u201c[t]his duty is \\nprecedent both in order of time and degree of \\nobligation, to the claims of Civil Society.\\u201d Id. Before \\nanyone is \\u201ca member of Civil Society,\\u201d they are \\u201cconsidered as a subject of the Governor of the \\nUniverse.\\u201d Id. For this reason, \\u201cin matters of \\nReligion, no man\\u2019s right is abridged by the institution of Civil Society.\\u201d Id. But Madison went \\nfurther. \\u201c[I]f religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that \\nof the Legislative Body.\\u201d Id., at \\u00a7 2, reprinted in \\nEverson , 330 U.S., at 65. Legislators who \\n\\u201cencroach[]\\u201d on the rights of the people, Madison \\nsaid, \\u201cexceed the commission from which they derive their authority, and are Tyrants.\\u201d Id. \\nRecognizing that Madison\\u2019s Memorial and \\nRemonstrance is not law, see City of Boerne v. Flores , \\n 11\\n521 U.S. 507, 541 (1997) (Scalia, J., concurring), it \\nnonetheless offers a clear understanding of why the \\nFounding Generation thought it so crucial to \\nmemorialize the inalienable freedom of religion in \\nthe First Amendment. And Madison\\u2019s defense of the \\nAmerican conception of religious liberty merely \\nechoed the prevalent thought at the founding \\u201cof the \\ndifference between religious faith and other forms of human judgment.\\u201d McConnell, Origins, at 1496. \\nAt the Founding, the prevailing view was that the \\n\\u201copinions of individuals\\u201d can not take \\u201cprecedence \\nover the decisions of civil society.\\u201d Id. The same was \\nnot true for religious convictions. \\u201cConflicts arising from religious convictions were conceived not as a \\nclash between the judgment of the individual and of \\nthe state, but as a conflict between earthly and \\nspiritual sovereigns.\\u201d Id. In those instances, the \\nperson holding the religious conviction \\u201cwas not seen as the instigator of the conflict; the believer was simply caught between the inconsistent demands of \\ntwo rightful authorities, through no fault of his own.\\u201d \\nId. This view is essential to understanding the \\nFounders\\u2019 belief that \\u201cfreedom of religion is unalienable because it is a duty to God and not a \\nprivilege of the individual.\\u201d Id., at 1497. \\n3. Bolstering this understanding, the historical \\nrecord surrounding adoption of the Bill of Rights \\nsuggests that the First Amendment\\u2019s use of the term \\u201creligion\\u201d was a deliberate choice. See McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1488. Although \\u201c[t]he recorded debates \\nin\\u201d both chambers of Congress \\u201ccast little light on the \\nmeaning of the free exercise clause,\\u201d looking at \\nsuccessive drafts of the clause from its consideration \\nand debate in the First Congress are especially \\n 12\\nenlightening. Id., at 1481, 1483. While earlier drafts \\nof the First Amendment used the phrase \\u201crights of \\nconscience,\\u201d the final version that emerged enshrined in the First Amendment a protection for the \\u201cfree \\nexercise of religion.\\u201d Id., at 1488. This phrasing lends \\nfurther support to the Founders\\u2019 understanding of religious freedoms. \\nTo the Founders, \\u201c[b]elief in a Supreme Being \\nwas\\u201d essential to \\u201creligion.\\u201d Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral, supra  note 2, at 9. Indeed, \\u201c[t]he historical \\nmaterials uniformly equate \\u2018religion\\u2019 with belief in God or in gods.\\u201d McConnell, Origins, at 1493. These references \\u201ccan be extended without distortion to \\ntranscendent extrapersonal authorities not \\nenvisioned in traditionally theistic terms\\u201d\\u2014for \\nexample, Madison\\u2019s use of \\u201cCreator,\\u201d \\u201cGovernor of \\nthe Universe,\\u201d and \\u201cUniversal Sovereign,\\u201d imply \\u201can attempt at a definition more compendious than the \\nfamiliar Judeo-Christian God, but it retains the distinction between transcendent authority and \\npersonal judgment.\\u201d Id.  \\nReligion, as understood by the Founders and \\nexpressed in the First Amendment, then, is best \\ndefined to encompass \\u201ca system of beliefs, whether \\npersonally or institutionally held, prompted by the \\nacceptance of transcendent realities or \\nacknowledging extratemporal actions.\\u201d Report to the \\nAttorney General, supra note 2, at 26\\u201327. This \\ninterpretation of religion is both accurate to the Founders\\u2019 understanding and consistent with their view that religion encompasses \\u201cduties that were \\nbeyond the jurisdiction of the state either to \\nprescribe or to proscribe.\\u201d Id., at 9. To the Founders, \\nreligion encompassed a subservience to a \\n 13\\n\\u201ctranscendent reality,\\u201d which if abandoned could \\nunleash \\u201cextratemporal consequences.\\u201d Id., at 29. \\nThis explains their motivation to preserve a robust freedom from government \\u201cinterfere[nce] with such \\nbeliefs or duties.\\u201d Id. \\nB. The Founding Generation\\u2019s understanding of religious liberty \\nencompassed protection for believers \\nfrom compelled speech that violates \\nfirmly held religious beliefs. \\n1. The least controversial point about the phrase \\n\\u201cfree exercise\\u201d is that \\u201cby definition, the words denote action or activity.\\u201d Id., at 19. To the Founders, \\nreligious liberty undoubtedly included \\u201creligiously motivated conduct  as well as belief.\\u201d McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1488 (emphasis added). This point bears emphasis because of this Court\\u2019s history rejecting \\nsuch a reading. See  Reynolds v. United States , 98 \\nU.S. 145, 164 (1878); but see Fulton v. City of Phila. , \\n141 S. Ct. 1868, 1913 (2021) (Alito, J., concurring) \\n(noting \\u201c[t]he Court ha[s] repudiated that distinction\\u201d in Reynolds  \\u201cthat the Free Exercise \\nClause protects beliefs, not conduct\\u201d). \\nIn substituting the \\u201crights of conscience\\u201d in favor \\nof a protection for the \\u201cfree exercise of religion,\\u201d the \\nFramer\\u2019s chose a phrase that \\u201cstrongly connoted \\naction,\\u201d in place of one that suggested mere opinion \\nor belief. McConnell, Origins, at 1489. Leading \\ndictionaries of that era defined \\u201cexercise\\u201d to include \\n\\u201c[l]abour of the body,\\u201d \\u201c[t]ask; that which one is \\nappointed to perform,\\u201d \\u201c[a]ct of divine worship, \\nwhether public or private,\\u201d or \\u201c[t]o use or practice.\\u201d See id.  (collecting dictionary definitions). Conscience, \\n 14\\non the other hand, was more likely to imply a \\n\\u201cnatural knowledge, or the faculty that decides on \\nthe right or wrong of actions.\\u201d Id. (quoting N. \\nWebster, A Dictionary of The English Language 301 (New Haven 1807)). \\nParticularly instructive on this distinction is the \\nGeorgia Charter of 1732. The Charter included \\u201ca \\nliberty of conscience allowe d in the worship of God, \\nto all persons,\\u201d but reserved the more exclusive right to \\u201ca free exercise of religion,\\u201d only to \\u201call such persons, except papists.\\u201d Id., at 1489\\u201390. By granting \\nCatholics only a liberty of conscience, but not the free exercise of religion, the Georgia Charter necessarily \\nreserved a fuller right to non-Catholic worshipers. \\nOne scholar has observed that \\u201c[t]he most plausible \\nreading of the provision is that it permitted Catholics \\nto believe what they wished . . . but did not permit \\nthem to put their faith into action.\\u201d Id., at 1490. \\nBy including a full and robust \\u201cfree exercise of \\nreligion\\u201d within the First Amendment, the Founders understood that they were protecting not only the \\nright for the religious to believe what their faith \\ntaught, but to put those beliefs into action. To \\nconclude otherwise would be to \\u201ctrivialize the idea of \\nreligion by separating thought from life, faith from \\nworks.\\u201d Report to the Attorney General, supra note \\n2, at 31. Possessing \\u201ca right to believe something in one\\u2019s mind without the freedom to utter it, advocate it, or even translate it into life,\\u201d is hardly a \\nsubstantive freedom at all. Id., at 31\\u201332. \\n2. Consistent with the Founders\\u2019 understanding \\nof a robust religious liberty protection that included \\nthe right to act out your faith was the axiom that \\n 15\\naction naturally includes expression or the freedom \\nto refrain from expression that conflicts with belief. \\nAlthough early religious liberty controversies were \\nrelatively limited, the historical record includes \\nexamples of protections for religious exercise \\nintertwined with such expressive activity. \\nAn early source of common conflict, for example, \\narose around the issue of oath requirements. Oaths \\nserved as \\u201cthe principal means of ensuring honest \\ntestimony and solemnizing obligations.\\u201d McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1467. But many early religious sects \\nrefused to take an oath, believing it was in conflict \\nwith the teachings of the New Testament.3 Id. \\nBecause oaths were required before court testimony, this refusal often left these sincere religious objectors \\nwithout access to the court system. Id. \\nIn response, many of the early colonies adopted \\nalternatives, allowing relig ious dissenters to take a \\npledge or make an affirmation rather than to swear \\nan oath. Id., at 1467\\u201368 (\\u201cBy 1789, virtually all of the \\nstates had enacted oath exemptions.\\u201d). This simple solution permitted religious sects access to the court \\nsystem, without requiring them to act out of step \\n                                           \\n3 See Matthew 5:33-37 (\\u201cAgain, ye have heard that it hath \\nbeen said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, \\nbut shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: But I say unto you, \\nSwear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: Nor \\nby the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is \\nthe city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy \\nhead, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever \\nis more than these cometh of evil.\\u201d). \\n 16\\nwith their religious beliefs or to make an expression \\nthey found incompatible with their faith. \\nA still more extreme example of laws yielding to \\nexpressive activities of religious sects in the \\nFounding Generation can be found in colonial \\nGeorgia. There, the Trus tees of Georgia granted \\ncertain groups of religious refugees a general exemption from the laws that allowed them \\u201cto organize themselves in accordance with their own \\nfaith.\\u201d Id., at 1471. One historia n described one such \\ngroup from Salzburg\\u2014which formed the town of Ebenezer\\u2014as \\u201ca state within a state, a sort of \\ntheocracy under the direction of their minsters with \\ndaily conferences of the entire congregation in which \\nGod\\u2019s guidance was invoked at the beginning and the \\nend.\\u201d Id. Although these groups where required to \\nobey certain colonial laws pertaining to military service, property, and good governance, they were \\n\\u201cotherwise free to govern themselves.\\u201d Id. at 1471 \\nn.312 \\nAnother founding era example of religious \\nexemptions for expressive action appeared in North \\nCarolina and Maryland. There, laws exempted \\nmembers of certain religious sects from a \\nrequirement to remove their hat in court. Id. The \\nreligious objectors viewed such an action as \\u201ca form of obeisance to secular authority forbidden by their \\nreligion.\\u201d Id., at 1472. Rather than forcing members \\nof these sects to choose be tween access to the courts \\nor expressing themselves in violation of their religious beliefs, states offered an exemption. \\nWhile this example may seem trivial by today\\u2019s \\nstandards, it was very mu ch on the minds of the \\n 17\\nFounding Generation. At the time, \\u201c[o]ne of the most \\nnotorious courtroom cases of religious intolerance in \\nEngland involved William Penn\\u2019s refusal to remove \\nhis hat when he appeared in court\\u201d to face \\nindictment for speaking to  an unlawful assembly. Id. \\nWhen Penn refused to remove a court-furnished hat from his head in respect to the court, he was held in \\ncontempt and imprisoned. Id. This case attracted \\nsignificant attention in America, and undoubtedly influenced the exemptions passed in North Carolina and Maryland. Id. \\nIndeed, the importance of this exemption was \\ndemonstrated in debates over the Bill of Rights in \\nthe First Congress. Id., at 1472, n.320. In ridiculing \\nthe list of freedoms proposed to be protected, Theodore Sedgwick of Mass achusetts remarked \\u201cthey \\nmight have declared that a man should have a right to wear his hat if he pleased . . . but he would ask the \\ngentleman whether he thought it necessary to enter \\nthese trifles in a declaration of rights.\\u201d Id. (citation \\nomitted). With unmistakable reference to the Penn case, John Page of Virginia replied: \\nThe gentleman from \\nMassachusetts . . . objects to the clause, \\nbecause the right is of so trivial a \\nnature. He supposes it no more \\nessential than whether a man has a \\nright to wear his hat or not; but let me \\nobserve to him that such rights have \\nbeen opposed, and a man has been obliged to pull off his hat when he \\nappeared before the face of authority; \\npeople have also been prevented from \\n 18\\nassembling together on their lawful \\noccasions.  \\nId. (citation omitted). Certainly, the Founders were \\nacutely aware of the potential for abuse by \\nauthorities absent a robust religious liberty \\nprotection that clearly extended to actions, including \\nreligiously motivated expression or non-expression. \\n3. Taken together, the Free Exercise Clause and \\nthe Free Speech Clause elevate the freedom not to \\nspeak out of accordance with firmly held religious beliefs to the highest echelon of First Amendment \\nprotection. This conclusion is buttressed by the First \\nAmendment\\u2019s other guarantees\\u2014e.g., freedom of \\nassembly and freedom to petition the government. If \\nthe Free Exercise Clause conferred nothing more \\nthan a \\u201cright to express religious beliefs,\\u201d it would \\n\\u201cadd nothing to the First Amendment, since that right is fully protected by the right to assemble, \\nspeak, and publish.\\u201d Report to the Attorney General, \\nsupra note 2, at 19. Indeed, \\u201cbecause religious \\nexpression is doubly protected by the constitutional \\ntext\\u201d it would make little sense if it were \\u201cless \\nprotected in practice.\\u201d Id. , at 19, n.30. \\nThe examples cited above represent a clear \\nunderstanding by the Founding Generation that civil \\nlaws, even of general applicability, must yield when they conflict with religious expression or the freedom \\nto refrain from expression on the basis of a sincerely \\nheld religious belief. As it seems early legislative \\nbodies believed exemptions in such cases were \\nrequired by the principle of free exercise, it stands to \\nreason that the Framers understood \\u201csimilar \\napplications of the principle\\u201d would guide the courts \\n 19\\nin these cases, once \\u201centrusted with the \\nresponsibility of enforcing\\u201d First Amendment \\nguarantees. McConnell, Origins, at 1473. \\nAlthough there was a dearth of litigation over \\nreligious liberty protections in the early years of the \\nRepublic, what scarce examples exist support this \\nview. Consider, for example, the earliest state court \\nopinion addressing the issue of a religious liberty exemption, People v. Phillips . In that case, the court \\nheld that the New York Constitution protected a Catholic priest from compulsory testimony to \\nmatters learned while administering the Sacrament \\nof Confession. See  id., at 1504. \\nImportant to the Phillips court was the notion \\nthat requiring testimony from the priest to \\u201cwhat he \\nreceives in confession, is to declare that there shall \\nbe no penance; and this important branch of the Roman Catholic religion would be thus annihilated.\\u201d \\nId. (citation omitted). The court did not believe it was \\ncompatible with religious liberty to compel expression that would so eviscerate a core belief of Catholic faith. Rather than establishing a special \\nprivilege for adherents to the Catholic faith, though, \\nthe court viewed its actions as necessary to ensure \\nCatholics received the same  treatment as Protestants \\n(the dominant faith at the time) in the administration of their sacraments. Id., at 1504-05. \\nThe through line to the Founding Generation\\u2019s \\nunderstanding of religious liberty was a belief that \\nsuch freedom was without substantive meaning if it did not encompass expression, and non-expression, \\nrooted in religious belief. Noted Nineteenth Century \\n 20\\nConstitutional commentator, Michigan Supreme \\nCourt Justice Thomas Cooley, explained: \\nAn earnest believer usually regards it as his duty to propagate his opinions, \\nand to bring others to his views. To \\ndeprive him of this right is to take from \\nhim the power to perform what he \\nconsiders a most sacred obligation.  \\nT. Cooley, A Treatise on the Constitutional \\nLimitations 665 (7th ed. 1903). Put another way: \\nreligious freedom, as understood by the Founders, \\nnecessarily encompasses the freedom to put belief \\ninto action, to engage in expression consistent with \\nthe dogmas of your faith, and to refrain from \\nexpression that may engender extratemporal consequences. \\nII. T\\nHIS COURT \\u2019S PRECEDENTS \\u2014ESPECIALLY ITS \\nDEMANDING APPLICATION OF THE LEAST -\\nRESTRICTIVE MEANS TEST \\u2014DEMONSTRATE \\nAGREEMENT WITH THE FOUNDING GENERATION \\u2019S \\nROBUST RELIGIOUS LIBERTY PROTECTIONS . \\nThis Court has a commendable history of \\nrecognizing the principles discussed above. In \\nparticular, the Court\\u2019s recent religious liberty \\njurisprudence has been a welcome reprieve for \\nmembers of all faith communities who have been disheartened by the antagonism of some government \\nactors. See,  e.g., Espinoza v. Mont. Dept of Revenue , \\n140 S. Ct. 2246 (2020); Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. \\nColo. Civil Rights Comm\\u2019n , 138 S. Ct. 1719 (2018); \\nHosanna-Tabor , 565 U.S. 171. \\n 21\\nOf particular note is the Court\\u2019s insistence on a \\nforceful application of the strict scrutiny test to any \\nrestriction that burdens religious liberty. Indeed, \\u201cin \\nthis highly sensitive constitutional area, \\u2018only the \\ngravest abuses, endangering paramount interests, \\ngive occasion for permissible limitation.\\u2019\\u201d Sherbert v. \\nVerner , 374 U.S. 398, 406 (1963) (quoting Thomas v. \\nCollins, 323 U.S. 516, 530 (1945)). \\n1. A few examples illustrate the point. Consider \\nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. , where this \\nCourt considered a government-imposed contraceptive mandate on private employers who \\nbelieved such a requirement to be against their \\nreligious beliefs. 573 U.S. 682, 726 (2014).\\n4 While \\nassuming, without deciding, that the government\\u2019s \\ninterest was compelling, the Court nonetheless found \\nthat the least-restrictive-means standard was not \\nmet. Id., at 728. Identifying alternative solutions to \\nthe rigid mandate imposed by the government, the Court explained, \\u201c[t]he least-restrictive-means \\nstandard is exceptionally demanding.\\u201d Id.  As Justice \\nKennedy explained, religious freedom \\u201cimplicates more than just freedom of belief\\u201d; rather \\u201c[i]t means, too, the right to express those beliefs and to establish \\none\\u2019s religious (or nonreligious) self-definition in the \\npolitical, civic, and econ omic life of our larger \\n                                           \\n4 Hobby Lobby  was decided under the Religious Freedom \\nRestoration Act of 1993 (\\u201cRFRA\\u201d), which requires as an initial \\nmatter finding a substantial government burden on the exercise of religion; if such a burden exists, the Court must determine \\nwhether there is a compelling governmental interest and that \\nthe burden is the least restrictive means of furthering that \\ninterest. Hobby Lobby , 573 U.S., at 694-95. \\n 22\\ncommunity.\\u201d Id., at 736\\u201337 (Kennedy, J., \\nconcurring). \\nIn another instance, this Court found Missouri \\nviolated a church\\u2019s religious  liberty guarantees under \\nthe First Amendment when it categorically denied \\ntheir participation in a grant program for playground \\nsurface materials. Trinity Lutheran Church of \\nColumbia, Inc. v. Comer , 137 S. Ct. 2012, 2017, 2025 \\n(2017). Finding that otherwise eligible grant \\nrecipients were disqualified solely because of their \\nreligious nature, this Court held that such a penalty \\nworked against the free exercise of religion and \\u201ctriggers the most exacting scrutiny.\\u201d Id., at 2021. \\nImportantly, the harm was not the denial of the grant itself but instead was Missouri\\u2019s refusal to \\neven allow the church to compete with secular \\norganizations for grant funds solely on the basis of \\nits religious identity. Id., at 2022. \\nMore recently still, this Court took up the mantle \\nof religious liberties in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia . \\nDespite the Catholic Church\\u2019s over two centuries of dedication to serving the needy children of \\nPhiladelphia, the City in 2018 stopped referring foster children to the Catholic Social Services (\\u201cCSS\\u201d) \\nafter learning the organization would not \\u201cconsider \\nprospective foster parents in same-sex marriages.\\u201d \\nFulton , 141 S. Ct., at 1874\\u201375. Finding that \\u201cit is \\nplain\\u201d the City burdens CSS\\u2019s \\u201creligious exercise by putting it to the choice of  curtailing its mission or \\napproving relationships inconsistent with its beliefs,\\u201d this Court sought a review of whether such burden \\nwas \\u201cconstitutionally permissible.\\u201d Id., at 1876. In \\ndetermining that Philadelphia imposed an unconstitutional burden on CSS\\u2019s religious exercise, \\n 23\\nFulton  admonishes that \\u201cso lo ng as the government \\ncan achieve its interests in a manner that does not \\nburden religion, it must do so.\\u201d Id., at 1881. \\nTaken together, the precedents of this Court \\nestablish that an exacting analysis is required in \\nreligious liberty cases to determine whether the \\ngovernment\\u2019s interest is compelling, and its burden \\nnarrowly tailored to achieve that interest. The \\nexistence of an alternative means for achieving even \\na compelling interest is nearly always fatal to the government\\u2019s argument.  \\n2. When religious liberty and free expression \\nconcerns intertwine, this Court has been even less \\nhesitant to invalidate an infringing law. This \\nskepticism is warranted, as attempts to compel \\nexpression that conflicts with an individual\\u2019s \\nreligious beliefs are nothing more than indirect \\nattempts to regulate religion itself. \\nIn 1943, this Court took issue with a West \\nVirginia law mandating a flag salute and pledge, when its application was challenged by a group of \\nJehovah\\u2019s Witnesses who said such action violated \\ntheir religious beliefs. W. Va. State Bd. Of Educ. V. \\nBarnette , 319 U.S. 624 (1943). Refusing to find that \\n\\u201ca Bill of Rights which guards the individual\\u2019s right \\nto speak his own mind, left it open to public \\nauthorities to compel him to utter what is not on his \\nmind,\\u201d the Barnette  Court blocked the law\\u2019s \\nenforcement. Id. , at 634; see also  id., at 645 (Murphy, \\nJ., concurring) (recognizing \\u201c[t]he right of freedom of thought and of religion as guaranteed by the \\nConstitution against State action includes both the \\nright to speak freely and the right to refrain from \\n 24\\nspeaking at all\\u201d). Underlying the Court\\u2019s opinion was \\nthe belief that \\u201c[i]f there is any fixed star in our \\nconstitutional constellation, it is that no official, high \\nor petty, can prescribe what  shall be orthodox in \\npolitics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act \\ntheir faith therein.\\u201d Id., at 642. \\nExpanding on the holding in Barnette , the Court \\nin Wooley v. Maynard  considered a religious \\nobjection to display of the New Hampshire state motto\\u2014\\u201cLive Free or Die\\u201d\\u2014on the license plate of a \\ncar owned by Jehovah\\u2019s Witness. 430 U.S. 705 (1977). In Wooley , the Court expressly rejected the \\nidea that \\u201cthe State may constitutionally require an individual to participate in the dissemination of an \\nideological message by displaying it on his private \\nproperty.\\u201d Id., at 713. \\nFoundational to its decision was the Court\\u2019s \\nholding that the freedoms contained within the First \\nAmendment \\u201cincludes both the right to speak freely \\nand the right to refrain from speaking at all.\\u201d Id., at \\n714. It matters not whether most agree with the message the State seeks to force a person to convey; the First Amendment unquestionably \\u201cprotects the \\nright of individuals to hold a point of view different \\nfrom the majority and to refu se to foster . . . an idea \\nthey find morally objectionable.\\u201d Id. , at 715. Finding \\nthe existence of a governmental burden, the Court \\nwas left to question whether a substantial \\ngovernmental interest existed and, if so, whether the \\nburden was narrowly tailored to advance that \\ninterest. Even assuming a legitimate and substantial interest, the Court concluded \\u201cthat purpose cannot \\nbe pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental \\n 25\\npersonal liberties when the end can be more \\nnarrowly achieved.\\u201d Id., at 716. New Hampshire \\nfailed that test. \\nIn still another line of cases, this Court found \\nthat it violated Constitutional protections to subject religious observants, who went door to door \\ndistributing religious materials and soliciting for the \\npurchase of religious books, to a government \\nsolicitation registration requirement. Murdock v. \\nPennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105 (1943); see also Follett v. \\nTown of McCormick , 321 U.S. 573 (1944). \\nAcknowledging that the practice was derived from the believer\\u2019s understanding that he was \\u201cobeying a \\ncommandment of God,\\u201d the Court found that the First Amendment prohibited the imposition of a \\ngenerally applicable registration requirement to \\nengage in such conduct. Murdock , 319 U.S., at 108, \\n117. Indeed, the Court went out of its way to describe the literature being distributed as \\u201cprovocative, \\nabusive, and ill-mannered.\\u201d Id., at 115\\u201316. \\nNevertheless, \\u201c[p]lainly  a community may not \\nsuppress . . . the dissemination of views because they \\nare unpopular, annoying or distasteful.\\u201d Id.,  at 116 \\nTo allow otherwise would \\u201cbe a complete repudiation of the philosophy of the Bill of Rights.\\u201d Id. \\nThe Court went further still , establishing that the \\nmere fact the religious materials were being \\u201csold\\u201d was not enough to transform \\u201cevangelism into a \\ncommercial enterprise.\\u201d Id., at 111. As such, the \\nCourt acknowledged heightened constitutional protections for \\u201cthose spreading their religious \\nbeliefs through the spoken and printed word.\\u201d Id. As \\ncompared to purely commercial activity, \\u201c[f]reedom of \\n 26\\npress, freedom of speech, fr eedom of religion are in a \\npreferred position.\\u201d Id., at 115. \\nEven Employment Division v. Smith , often \\ncriticized as having watered down constitutional \\nreligious liberty protections, recognized the Court\\u2019s \\nunique hostility toward burdens that implicate both \\nthe free exercise of religion and the freedom of \\nspeech. The \\u201cFirst Amendment bars application of a \\nneutral, generally applicable law to religiously \\nmotivated action\\u201d when that action \\u201cinvolve[s] not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but the Free \\nExercise Clause in conjunction with other \\nconstitutional protections, such as freedom of \\nspeech.\\u201d Empl. Div. v. Smith , 494 U.S. 872, 881\\u201382 \\n(1990). Even some preceden ts, decided on free speech \\ngrounds alone, were undoubtedly reinforced by \\ntouches of freedom-of-religion concerns. Id. \\n3. This much is clear: the arc of this Court\\u2019s \\nprecedent bends in one incontrovertible direction. \\nScrutiny of any government burden is at its zenith \\nwhen the burden effects an individual\\u2019s exercise of their religious beliefs in a manner that implicates \\nfree speech protections. This conclusion, rooted in the \\nhistory and tradition of religious exercise as \\nunderstood by the Founders and enshrined in the \\nFirst Amendment, demands that any such burden be \\nsubjected to the most rigorous application of strict \\nscrutiny analysis. \\nIt is precisely for this reason that, to the best of \\nAmicus Curiae\\u2019s knowledge, the Court has never \\nissued an opinion finding that governmentally \\ncompelled religious speech satisfies strict scrutiny. \\nSee 303 Creative Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Elenis , 6 F.4th \\n 27\\n1160, 1191 (U.S. 10th Cir. 2021) (Tymkovich, C.J., \\ndissenting) (\\u201c[T]he majority takes the remarkable\\u2014\\nand novel\\u2014stance that the government may force \\nMs. Smith to produce messages that violate her \\nconscience. . . . No case has ever gone so far.\\u201d). \\nThis case should not be the first. \\nIII. THE TENTH CIRCUIT \\u2019S OPINION CANNOT BE \\nSQUARED EITHER WITH THE FIRST \\nAMENDMENT \\u2019S RICH HISTORY OR THIS COURT \\u2019S \\nPROTECTION OF BELIEVERS \\u2019 FREE SPEECH \\nRIGHTS . \\nIn its permissive application of strict scrutiny, the \\nTenth Circuit bastardized this Court\\u2019s protection of free speech rights, especially as applied to religious \\nexpression. If allowed to stand, its precedent will give license to courts across this Country to \\nhumiliate members of all religious sects by \\ncompelling them to speak in contravention of their \\nsincerely held religious beliefs. By purporting to \\napply strict scrutiny, the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s opinion \\ncheapened the First Amendment rights of Catholics, \\nProtestants, Muslims, Jews, and all other believers alike. \\nLuckily, this precedent d oes not need to stand. \\nThis Court, once again, has an opportunity to \\nadmonish that the free speech protections of \\nbelievers are no less than non-believers and, in fact, \\nare heightened when faced with government \\nregulation that would compel speech antithetical to the tenants of a believer\\u2019s faith. The First \\nAmendment commands such a result. \\n 28\\nAlthough the Tenth Circuit rightly concluded that \\nMs. Smith\\u2019s website designs are \\u201cpure speech,\\u201d 303 \\nCreative LLC, 6 F.4th, at 1176, the Tenth Circuit \\nwrongly concludes that the commercial nature of Ms. \\nSmith\\u2019s speech gives Colorado a regulatory hook to \\nlatch onto. Id., at 1179. By failing to acknowledge the \\nreligious nature of her objection to the would-be compelled speech, the Tenth Circuit did not afford \\nher First Amendment rights the \\u201cpreferred\\u201d status \\nthey deserve.\\n5 Cf., Murdock , 319 U.S., at 115. What \\nis remarkable is that the religious nature of Ms. Smith\\u2019s objection is not disputed. See 303 \\nCreative, 6 F. 4th, at 1172 (Ms. Smith is \\u201cwilling to create custom graphics and websites for gay, lesbian, \\nor bisexual clients . . . so long as the custom graphics \\nand websites do not violate [her] religious beliefs, as is true for all customers.\\u201d (internal quotation marks \\nomitted)); id., at 1192 (Tymkovich, C.J., dissenting) \\n(\\u201cIn short, Colorado appear s to agree that Ms. Smith \\ndoes not distinguish between customers based on \\nprotected-class status and thus advances the aims of \\nCADA. But when any customer asks Ms. Smith to \\ncreate expressive content that violates her sincerely \\nheld beliefs, she will decline the request.\\u201d). \\n                                           \\n5 Remarkably, the Tenth Circuit  suggests that its sweeping \\nholding may not apply to \\u201call artists\\u201d if they were not engaged \\nin \\u201ccommercial activity,\\u201d but rather \\u201ccommissioning a mural for some charitable purpose.\\u201d 303 Creative , 6 F.4th, at 1182, n.6. To \\nsuggest that a local artist wh o refuses to paint a Christian \\nmural for a church may enjoy more constitutional protections \\nthan a woman called to live out her sincerely held religious \\nbeliefs by creating custom wedding websites is, thankfully, not supported by the history or tradition of the First Amendment \\nand the muscular protections it affords religious believers. \\n 29\\nThis failure is compounded by the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s \\nfallacy of a marketplace of one for Ms. Smith\\u2019s \\nspeech. Id. at 1180. Such convenient analysis \\nallowed the court to conclude \\u201cthere are no less intrusive means of providing equal access to those  \\ntypes of services.\\u201d Id. (emphasis added). But this \\nclever reasoning flips this Court\\u2019s precedent on its \\nhead. Rather than prioritize the religious speaker\\u2019s \\nobjection in search of a less restrictive means, the \\ncourt below merely concluded that she is the only one and therefore no other means will suffice. But, \\nwhere, as here, the government can achieve its interests without burdening religion, the \\nConstitution requires it to do so. Fulton , 141 S. Ct., \\nat 1881. The analysis is also anomalous in the free speech context because it cannot be that the more \\nunique and distinctive the speech, the less  First \\nAmendment protection it deserves. But that is the staggering breadth of the Tenth Circuit majority\\u2019s \\nconclusion. See 303 Creative , 6 F.4th, at 1204-05 \\n(Tymkovich, C.J., dissenting).  \\nMoreover, by categorizing Ms. Smith as nothing \\nmore than a \\u201cpublic accommodation,\\u201d the Tenth \\nCircuit minimized her right to participate in the \\nmarketplace, even as a woman of faith. See 303 \\nCreative, 6 F.4th, at 1181 (\\u201c[W]hether an exception limits market access depends upon the uniqueness of \\nthe public accommodation\\u2019s goods and services\\u2014not \\nthe sincerity of the public accommodation\\u2019s beliefs.\\u201d). \\nTo deny a benefit to those \\u201cwho engage in certain \\nforms of speech is in effect to penalize them for such \\nspeech,\\u201d and constitutionally, no different than \\nconditioning a benefit on a person\\u2019s \\u201cwillingness to \\nviolate a cardinal principle of her religious faith;\\u201d the \\n 30\\nresult is the same: to \\u201cdeter[] or discourage[] the \\nexercise of First Amendment rights of expression.\\u201d \\nSherbert , 374 U.S., at 405-06 (citing Speiser v. \\nRandall, 357 U.S. 513, 518 (1958)). Here too, Colorado seeks to impose the same constitutional \\nharm: speak in violation of your core religious faith \\nor lose the benefit of marketplace participation. Put \\nsimply, Colorado seeks to punish Ms. Smith for her \\nsincerely held religious beliefs. See also Trinity \\nLutheran Church , 137 S. Ct., at 2021\\u201322 (finding a \\nconstitutional violation where a burden puts \\nreligious believers \\u201cto a choice: [] participate in an \\notherwise available benefit\\u201d or maintain your \\nreligious identity). \\nThe same fundamental principle must apply to \\nfree speech and religious practices when they act in concert: \\u201cIn an open, pluralistic, self-governing \\nsociety, the expression of an idea cannot be \\nsuppressed simply because some find it offensive, \\ninsulting, or even wounding.\\u201d Fulton , 141 S. Ct., at \\n1924-25 (Alito, J., concurring). To lose this principle is to lose the \\u201cpreservation of religious freedom.\\u201d Id., \\nat 1925. That is because \\u201c[s]uppressing speech\\u2014or \\nreligious practice\\u2014simply because it expresses an idea that some find hurtful is a zero-sum game.\\u201d Id. \\nThis Court\\u2019s jurisprudence confirms this link \\nbetween religious exercise and free speech because \\nthis Court\\u2019s opinions \\u201cmake it perfectly clear that \\ndiscrimination against religious, as opposed to \\nsecular, expression is viewpoint discrimination.\\u201d \\nNurre v. Whitehead , 559 U.S. 1025, 1028 (2010) \\n(Alito, J., dissenting). And because viewpoint discrimination is \\u201can egregious form of content \\ndiscrimination,\\u201d Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of \\n 31\\nthe Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995), it brings \\nwith it heightened constitutional skepticism. \\nAlthough some may find Ms. Smith\\u2019s religious \\nbeliefs objectionable, \\u201creligions, and those who \\nadhere to religious doctrines, may continue to \\nadvocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by \\ndivine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be \\ncondoned.\\u201d Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U.S. 644, 679 \\n(2015). \\u201cAn open society can keep that promise while still respecting the \\u2018dignity,\\u2019 \\u2018worth,\\u2019 and fundamental equality of all members of the \\ncommunity.\\u201d Fulton , 141 S. Ct., at 1925 (Alito, J., \\nconcurring) (quoting Masterpiece Cakeshop , 138 S. \\nCt., at 1727). Ms. Smith should be free to practice all \\naspects of her faith, without fear of government-\\ncompelled expression against her sincerely held \\nreligious beliefs. The Constitution demands no less. \\nCONCLUSION \\n \\n\\u201c[T]here is before us the right of freedom to \\nbelieve, freedom to worship one\\u2019s Maker according to the dictates of one\\u2019s conscience, a right which the \\nConstitution specifically shelters.\\u201d Barnette , 319 \\nU.S., at 645 (Murphy, J., concurring). For this Court, there is \\u201cno loftier duty or responsibility than to \\nuphold that spiritual freedom to its farthest \\nreaches.\\u201d Id. \\nTo exclude Ms. Smith from offering her services\\u2014\\nsolely on the basis of her religious identity\\u2014would be \\n\\u201codious to our Constitution.\\u201d Trinity Lutheran \\nChurch , 137 S.

As part of that project, EPA has obtained emails and handwritten and typewritten notes under public records requests, which records on their face confess to the driving factor behind this liti-gation and similar litigation and inform the inquiry into federal versus state jurisdiction in this booming class of \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation filed in state courts. These records EPA obtained prompted it to file its first amicus  brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for \\nthe First Circuit, where removal of another among the growing number of \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d lawsuits filed \\nby governmental entities seeking billions of dollars \\nfrom private parties is pending.\\n2 That brief revealed \\ntwo sets of notes each purporting, independently, to record the assertion by an official with the governmen-tal plaintiff in that case, the State of Rhode Island, that the litigation seeks to obtain a \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d to underwrite that State\\u2019s spending ambitions, \\n \\n 1 Pursuant to Rule 37.6, counsel for Amicus  certifies that no \\ncounsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in part and that no person or entity other than Amici  or their counsel made a \\nmonetary contribution intended to fund the brief \\u2019s preparation or submission.

Leave for EPA to file as amicus \\ncuriae  granted on March 26, 2020 \\n2 \\n after the State\\u2019s legislature declined to provide the de-\\nsired funds. Rhode Island\\u2019s confession was made at a meeting attended by \\u201ccabinet\\u201d-level representatives of numerous state governments from across the nation, including a representative from Maryland, and empha-sized the desire to pr oceed in state courts.\\n3 In that First \\nCircuit litigation, numerous  parties rely upon the \\nFourth Circuit\\u2019s decision in  the instant matter, and par-\\nties to the First Circuit litigation ad dressed the Fourth \\nCircuit\\u2019s opinion below in let ters of supplemental au-\\nthority pursuant to Fed. R. Ap p. Pro. 28(j). Because EPA \\nhas obtained records confe ssing the rationale behind \\nthe veritable tsunami of state-court \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d lawsuits such as the one now before this Court, and af-firming the plaintiffs\\u2019 emp hasis among peers and other \\npotential governmental plaint iff-recruits on using state \\ncourts for these actions with  national p olicy implica-\\ntions and avoiding the federal court system, EPA is keenly interested in this case and asks this Court to \\ngrant certiorari to address th e proper relationship be-\\ntween the state and federal court systems. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\n As important as climate policy is to both state and \\nfederal governments, equally and arguably more im-portant is the principle that the courts\\u2019 role is not to \\nmake policy judgments. This Court held in American \\nElectric Power v. Connecticut , 131 S. Ct. 2527, 2539, \\n \\n 3 A full list of attendees prepared by the organizers and ob-\\ntained under Colorado law is ava ilable at https://govoversight.org/ \\nwp-content/uploads/2020/01/Fulsome-list-of-participants.png. \\n3 \\n 564 U.S. 410, 426 (2011) that \\u201cthe federal courts would \\nhave no warrant to employ the federal common law of nuisance to upset\\u201d federal primacy in climate regula-tory policy. But rather than heed the American Electric \\nPower  opinion\\u2019s warnings that federal policy decisions \\nare to be made by Congress or by federal agencies ex-ercising properly delegated authority, certain litigants have instead attempted to end run that holding by seeking to create policy in state, rather than federal, courts. While federal courts ar e courts of limited juris-\\ndiction, in this matter the de cision below is based upon \\na series of cases that have eviscerated the jurisdiction of federal courts, even when important federal inter-ests are at stake. This is in conflict with the decisions of other Circuits, congressional action taken since these \\nFourth Circuit precedents were  adopted, and this Court\\u2019s \\nown rulings. Allowing the opin ion below to stand will \\ncause mischief in state courts across the nation. Re-cently obtained public records provide strong impetus to acknowledge, as a formal matter, that this \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation campaign is an impermissible use of the state courts, just as this Court previously held it \\nwas an impermissible use of the federal courts. This Court should prevent litigants from seeking the most favorable forum to obtain p olitical and policy ends by \\njudicial means. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\n  \\n4 \\n ARGUMENT \\nI. THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\\u2019S DECISION CON-\\nTRADICTS RECENT JURISPRUDENCE \\nAND LEGISLATION. THIS COURT SHOULD \\nGRANT CERTIORARI TO ENFORCE ITS OWN PRECEDENTS AND CONGRESSIONAL INTENT \\n The decision below, designated for publication and \\nwith the potential to shape or confuse the law for years \\nto come, is based on a series of precedents unique to the Fourth Circuit, many of which contradict more re-\\ncent holdings of this Court and even statutory changes \\nenacted by Congress. The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s reliance on its own, idiosyncratic precedents led to a result that is \\nin conflict with the holdings  of numerous other courts \\nand which will, if allowed to stand, result in mischief across the nation. \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision below, while pub-\\nlished only this year, has its foundations in a holding \\nfrom the 1970s that has been  adrift in changing legal \\nseas since then, and was implicitly swamped by a hold-ing of this Court twenty years ago. That Fourth Circuit \\nopinion, Noel v. McCain , 538 F.2d 633 (4th Cir. 1976), \\nheld that remand orders are essentially unreviewable unless they raise very narrow statutory grounds. Stare \\ndecisis  is an important legal principle, but in this case \\nthe Fourth Circuit\\u2019s adherence to its own precedents rather than those of this Court was misplaced. \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision below acknowledges \\nthat this Court subsequently interpreted the same \\n5 \\n statutory language differently in Yamaha Motor Corp., \\nU.S.A. v. Calhoun , 516 U.S. 199 (1996). More recently, \\nthe Seventh Circuit reached a contrary conclusion \\nabout the reviewability of di strict court orders to re-\\nmand in Lu Junhong v. Boeing Co. , 792 F.3d 805, 810\\u2013\\n13 (7th Cir. 2015). Even assuming, arguendo , that the \\nFourth Circuit properly decided the Noel  case in 1976, \\ncontinued reliance on Noel  is no longer appropriate. \\n It isn\\u2019t just precedent t hat has changed since the \\nFourth Circuit issued its opinion in Noel . Relevant \\nstatutory law has also changed: the Removal Clarifica-\\ntion Act of 2011, Pub. L. No. 112-51, 125 Stat. 545, clar-ified Congressional intent for federal courts to \\u201cclarify \\nand improve certain provisions relating to the removal \\nof litigation against Federal officers or agencies to Fed-\\neral courts.\\u201d \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision below (hereinafter \\n\\u201cBaltimore \\u201d), is based on foundations that Congress, \\nother federal courts, and this Court have steadily \\neroded since the Fourth Circu it issued the authority on \\nwhich Baltimore  rests. This Court, the Seventh Circuit, \\nand Congress itself have all spoken more recently. The \\ninnovative legal theories brought by the Plaintiffs in this case further highlight the need to decide the mat-\\nter based on current law. This Court should take the \\nopportunity to apply the Removal Clarification Act and resolve the split in the circuits that the Baltimore  opin-\\nion below aggravates. \\n \\n6 \\n II. IF THE DECISION BELOW STANDS, FED-\\nERAL COURTS WILL BE UNABLE TO PRE-\\nVENT FEDERAL POLICIES FROM BEING UNDERMINED AT THE STATE LEVEL \\n This suit is but one of many similar suits being \\nfiled all over the country. More than a dozen U.S. cit-\\nies, states and counties including the State of Rhode Island, City and County of Boulder (CO), City and \\nCounty of Honolulu (HI), City of New York (NY), \\nMarin, San Mateo and Santa Cruz Counties (CA), the cities of Imperial Beach, Oakland, Richmond, San \\nFrancisco, San Mateo, and Santa Cruz (CA), and King \\nCounty (WA), among others have filed similar claims against similar and generally the same defendants al-\\nleging similar causes of action which allegedly arise \\nunder state law. As at least one court has previously noted, multi-front litigation raises important concerns \\nabout the motivations of litigants. Chevron Corp. v. \\nDonziger , 974 F.Supp.2d 362, 475 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (\\u201cThe \\npoint of the multi-front strategy thus was to leverage \\nthe expense, risks, and bu rden to [defendant] of de-\\nfending itself in multiple jurisdictions to achieve a swift recovery, most likely by precipitating a settle-\\nment.\\u201d), later upheld at Chevron Corp. v. Donziger , 833 \\nF.3d 74 (2d Cir. 2016), cert. denied  at 137 S. Ct. 2268 \\n(2017). \\n This explosion in such cases filed in state court \\nseeks many hundreds of billions of dollars from private \\nparties, and seeks to enlist the defendants as advo-\\ncates in pressing for the plai ntiffs\\u2019 and their partners\\u2019 \\ndesired federal policies. Records obtained by Amicus  \\n7 \\n also show the attempt to us e the litigation to obtain \\ngovernmental revenues after that failed through the \\nappropriate, political process (see, infra ). Affirming the \\nimpropriety of this use of the courts as well as the ar-dent campaign by state and municipal plaintiffs to \\nkeep the matters away from the federal court and ex-\\nclusively before state courts, EPA has obtained emails and handwritten and typewritten notes under public \\nrecords requests, further discussed below, that illus-\\ntrate the danger of allowing st ate courts to interfere in \\nthis way in lawful interstate commerce conducted un-\\nder the auspices of the federal government. Key among \\nthese public records are two sets of notes each purport-ing, independently, to record the assertion by a senior \\nState of Rhode Island official that the objective of its \\nlitigation was to obtain a \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d for the State\\u2019s spending ambitions, in the face of a leg-\\nislature that does not share the executive\\u2019s priorities. \\n Both sets of notes record that official as emphasiz-\\ning the use of state courts to  obtain this funding denied \\nthem by the legislature. Other records, also noted, in-\\nfra, record the plaintiff \\u2019s legal counsel\\u2019s team, at least \\nsome of whom also represent the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore in this litigation,\\n4 lobbying gov-\\nernmental officials to join the campaign emphasizing the strategy of advancing this cause in the \\u201cmore ad-vantageous venue for these cases,\\u201d which plaintiffs confess is to be had in state courts. \\n \\n 4 The California law firm Sher Edling LLP represents both \\nthe State of Rhode Island in the First Circuit and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore in the Fourth Circuit. \\n8 \\n  These public records obtained through state open \\nrecords laws by Amicus  EPA represent a Rhode Island \\n\\u201ccabinet\\u201d-level official confiding to peers that the \\nState\\u2019s elected representatives are insufficiently moved by the plaintiff \\u2019s requests to enact laws raising \\nthe revenues the State\\u2019s executive desires; and that it \\nis thus \\u201clooking for [a] sustainable funding stream,\\u201d having been reduced to \\u201csuing big oil\\u201d for its \\u201cPriority \\n\\u2013 sustainable funding stream .\\u201d Notably, both sets of \\nnotes capture the State of Rhode Island as having em-phasized the \\u201cstate court\\u201d aspect of its plan. \\n These records, representing a similarly-situated \\nplaintiff \\u2019s confession, as recorded identically by two by \\nothers in the comfort of a presumably candid and off-\\nthe-record private meeting with peers and funders of \\u201cclimate\\u201d activism, leave little doubt that this growing \\nwave of state court \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation seeks \\nat least two impermissible objectives. First, this type of litigation seeks to use (state) courts to effectively \\ncreate federal energy and environmental policy. Sec-\\nond, in addition to using litigation as a stand-in for \\nthe political process that has denied state and munic-\\nipal plaintiffs their desired policies, it seeks to use lit-\\nigation to raise revenues having be en denied them \\nwhere revenues would properly be raised, which \\nagain is by the po litical process. \\n These public records provide strong impetus to \\nacknowledge, as a formal matter, that this \\u201cclimate \\nnuisance\\u201d litigation campaign is an impermissible use of the courts, seeking the most favorable forum to ob-\\ntain political ends by judicial means; that when filed \\n9 \\n they must remain in federal court; and that they \\nshould be dismissed for the same reasons. \\n \\nIII. PUBLIC RECORDS OBTAINED BY PRO-\\nPOSED AMICUS CURIAE  AFFIRM THIS \\nCASE BELONGS IN FEDERAL COURT \\n Amicus  EPA has obtained public records from Col-\\norado State University\\u2019s Center for a New Energy Economy (\\u201cCNEE\\u201d) under the Colorado Open Records \\nAct (\\u201cCORA\\u201d). Those records have now been brought to \\nthe attention of the First Circuit in related litigation, and are proper subject for judic ial notice by this Court. \\nSee Fed. Rule Evid. 201(b)(2). The records pertain to a \\ntwo-day meeting in July 2019 hosted by the Rockefel-ler Brothers Fund (\\u201cRBF\\u201d) at the Rockefeller family \\nmansion at Pocantico, NY. They include numerous \\nemails, agendas and other materials. Most pertinent, they also include a set of handwritten notes and a sec-\\nond, corroborating set of typewritten notes. According \\nto the public records themselves, the former was pre-pared by attendee Carla Frisch of the Rocky Mountain \\nInstitute (\\u201cRMI\\u201d), and the latter by attendee Katie \\nMcCormack of the Energy Foundation.\\n5 \\n \\n 5 These are available, respectively, at https://climatelitigationwatch. \\norg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Carla-Frisch-handwritten-notes- EPA_CORA1505.pdf and https:// climatelitigationwatch.org/ \\nwp-content/uploads/2020/03/EF-Katie-McCormack-typed-notes-EPA_CORA1542.pdf. These documents are identified in an August \\n20, 2019 email from CNEE\\u2019s Patric k Cummins transmitting them \\nto RBF\\u2019s Michael Northrop, Subject: meeting highlights, available at https://climatelitigationwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ \\n \\n10 \\n  This was a private event, styled \\u201cAccelerating \\nState Action on Climate Change,\\u201d if hosted as a forum \\nfor policy activists and a major funder to coordinate \\nwith senior public employees, e.g., a governor\\u2019s chief of staff and department secretaries and their cabinet \\nequivalents from fifteen states. These states included \\nFirst Circuit Plaintiff the State of Rhode Island, repre-sented by its Director of the Department of Environ-\\nmental Management, Janet Coit.\\n6 \\n These notes purport to contemporaneously record \\nthe comments of Director Coit discussing Rhode Is-\\nland\\u2019s entry in this litigation campaign, among peers. One passage in each set of no tes, attributed to Director \\nCoit and replicated almost verbatim in both, is partic-\\nularly striking and relevant, affirming two points that have become obvious and which should inform key de-\\ncisions confronting the judiciary in this \\u201cclimate nui-\\nsance\\u201d litigation campaign. \\n The records show RMI\\u2019s Frisch recorded Director \\nCoit speaking to this litigation as shown in the below \\n \\nEdited-notes-transmittal-email-CSU-suggests-Snail-mail-probably- \\ncovered-EPA_CORA1481_Redacted.pdf. \\u201cRBF CNEE climate pol-icy notes Jul 17 18.docx\\u201d are Katie McCormack\\u2019s notes (Energy Foundation); these appear to be produced as document EPA_ CORA1542.pdf, derived from Ms. McCormick\\u2019s transmittal email \\nbeing 1541, in which she describes her notes as long, and 1542 consists of 18 pages of notes;  \\u201cXerox Scan_07222019155622.pdf \\u201d \\nare Carla Frisch\\u2019s handwritten notes (this was produced as docu-ment EPA_CORA1505.pdf ). \\n \\n6 The participant list is availabl e at https://climatelitigation-\\nwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/List-of-Attendees-EPA_ CORA1037.pdf. \\n11 \\n excerpted image (Ms. Frisch\\u2019s notes are available in \\nfull at https://climatelitigationwatch.org/wp-content/ \\nuploads/2020/03/Carla-Frisch-handwritten-notes-EPA_ \\nCORA1505.pdf ). Ms. Frisch recorded Director Coit as saying, about this suit: \\nRI \\u2013 Gen Assembly D but doesn\\u2019t care on env/climate \\nlooking for sustainable funding stream \\nsuing big oil for RI damages in state court \\n \\n The first line-item attributes to Director Coit the \\nposition that the Rhode Island legislature is not per-suaded of the claims set fort h by the State in its litiga-\\ntion. This reluctance to politically impose the revenue-\\nraising measures (taxes) necessary for such funding streams is inherently shared among all \\u201cclimate nui-\\nsance\\u201d plaintiffs. The excerp t appears to also reflect \\nDirector Coit\\u2019s view of why the Rhode Island legisla-ture has thereby declined to obtain from the taxpayer, \\n\\n12 \\n and then appropriate to the State, the revenue streams \\nthat governmental Plaintiff Rhode Island desires. \\n This entry on its face represents a senior official \\nconfessing that Rhode Island\\u2019s climate litigation, es-\\nsentially identical to that in the Baltimore case below, \\nis in fact a product of Rhode Island\\u2019s elected represent-atives lacking enthusiasm for politically enacting cer-\\ntain policies, including reve nue measures, thus leaving \\nthe state \\u201clooking for [a] sustainable funding stream,\\u201d and so \\u201csuing big oil.\\u201d This characterizes all such gov-\\nernmental plaintiffs and su its including the matter \\nin the Fourth Circuit case which is the subject of the \\nPetition in this matter. \\n Fortunately, we can be confident that Ms. Frisch \\ndid not mishear Director Coit. The Energy Foundation\\u2019s \\nKatie McCormack provided RBF with a typewritten \\nset of her own notes transcribing the proceedings. To this Court\\u2019s further benefit, Ms. McCormack\\u2019s type-\\nwritten transcription of Director Coit\\u2019s commentary \\nreads almost verbatim as Ms. Frisch\\u2019s. \\n Ms. McCormack recorded Di rector Coit as saying: \\n* Assembly very conservative leadership \\u2013 don\\u2019t \\ncare about env\\u2019t \\n* If care, put it in the budget \\n* Priority \\u2013 sustainable funding stream * State court against oil/gas \\n13 \\n  \\n These notes on their face both affirm two realities \\nthat have become inescapable in recent years about this epidemic of \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation, all chan-neled into state courts (aft er the first generation of \\nsuits floundered in federal co urt, and ultimately were \\nterminated by this Court in American Electric Power v. \\nConnecticut , 131 S. Ct. 2527, 2539, 564 U.S. 410, 426 \\n(2011)).\\n7 That is that these suits seek to use the courts \\nto stand in for policymakers on two fronts. First, these suits ask the courts to substitute their authority for that of the political branches of government on matters of policy. Second, these suits seek billions of dollars in revenues, again the province of the political branches, for distribution toward political uses and constituen-cies. \\n O n  t h a t  fi r s t  c o u n t  o f  policymaking through the \\ncourts, the RBF meeting notes ratify a comment made to The Nation magazine by the plaintiffs\\u2019 tort lawyer credited with inventing this wave of litigation, Matt \\n \\n 7 See, e.g., Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp ., \\n663 F.Supp.2d 863 (N.D. Cal. 2009), upheld at  696 F.3d 849 (9th \\nCir. 2012). \\n\\n14 \\n Pawa. The magazine wrote, \\u201cAt the end of his speech, \\nSenator [Sheldon] Whitehouse [of Rhode Island] re-minded his colleagues of their \\u2018legislative responsibil-ity to address climate change.\\u2019 But it\\u2019s clear that too many lawmakers have abdicated, thus the pressure to tackle the climate issue thro ugh existing regulations \\nlike the Clean Air Act, and through the courts. \\u2018I\\u2019ve been hearing for twelve years or more that legislation is right around the corner that\\u2019s going to solve the global-warming problem, and that litigation is too long, difficult, and arduous a path,\\u2019 said Matthew Pawa, a climate attorney. \\u2018Legislation is going nowhere, so liti-gation could potentially play an important role.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n8 \\n Such use of the courts is of course improper but \\nalso informs a conclusion that these cases, when \\nbrought, belong in federal cour t, as well as that they \\nshould be dismissed for reasons including the inher-\\nently obvious, and now repeatedly confessed, purpose. \\n The second conclusion affirmed by these twice-\\nsourced assertions by the First Circuit plaintiffs is that \\nthis type of litigation is a grab for revenues, which again must properly be purs ued through the political \\nprocess. This is related to the first, in that, like policy, \\nsuch revenue-raising measures must be enacted by the voters\\u2019 elected representatives or approved directly by \\nvoters. Instead, with the desire for more \\u201cfunding \\nstreams\\u201d being yet another way the political process \\n \\n 8 Zoe Carpenter, The Government May Already Have the \\nLaw It Needs to Beat Big Oil , The Nation (July 15, 2015), \\nhttps://www.thenation.com/article/the-government-may-already-have-the-law-it-needs-to-beat-big-oil/. \\n15 \\n has failed such plaintiffs, we see them circumventing \\nthat process through this litigation campaign. \\n That the desire for more governmental revenue, \\nwithout adopting the necessa ry direct taxes for which \\nthere can be a political price to pay, was behind such \\nlitigation was suggested by the U.S. Chamber of Com-merce in a 2019 report enti tled \\u201cMitigating Munici-\\npality Litigation: Scope and Solutions,\\u201d published by \\nthe Chamber\\u2019s Institute fo r Legal Reform. That re-\\nport highlighted: \\n* \\u201cFor instance, local government leaders may \\neye the prospect of significant recoveries as a \\nmeans of making up for budget shortfalls.\\u201d \\n* \\u201cLarge settlements like those produced in the \\ntobacco litigation are alluring to municipali-\\nties facing budget constraints.\\u201d \\n* \\u201cSevere, persistent municipal budget con-\\nstraints have coincided with the rise of munic-ipal litigation agains t opioid manufacturers \\nas local governments are promised large re-\\ncoveries with no risk to municipal budgets by contingency fee trial lawyers.\\u201d \\n* \\u201cConclusion  A convergence of factors is propelling munici-\\npalities to file affirmative lawsuits against corporate entities. \\n There is the \\u2018push\\u2019 factor: municipalities face \\nhistoric budgetary cons traints and a public \\ninundated with news reports on the opioid cri-\\nsis, rising sea levels, and data breaches. And \\n16 \\n there is the \\u2018pull\\u2019 of potential multimillion-\\ndollar settlements and low-cost, contingency \\nfee trial lawyers. As a consequence, munici-\\npalities are pivoting to the courts by the thou-\\nsands.\\u201d9 \\n The National Association of Manufacturers\\u2019 Cen-\\nter for Legal Action has similarly argued that, \\u201cThe \\ntowns and lawyers have said that this litigation is \\nsolely about money. The towns want funding for local projects, and their lawyers are working on a contin-\\ngency fee basis, which means they aren\\u2019t paid if they \\ndon\\u2019t win.\\u201d\\n10 \\n The records EPA has obtained now provide docu-\\nmentary evidence to support these concerns that the courts are being exploited to balance municipal/state \\nbudgets and make policy decisions that legislators \\nhave declined to make. \\n \\n  \\n \\n 9 United States Chamber of Co mmerce, \\u201cMitigating Munici-\\npality Litigation: Scope and Solutions,\\u201d U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, March 2019, h ttps://www.instituteforlegalre-\\nform.com/uploads/sites/1/Mitigating-Municipality-Litigation-2019- Research.pdf, at p. 1, 6, 7 and 18, respectively. \\n \\n10 Manufacturers\\u2019 Accountability Project, \\u201cBeyond the Court-\\nroom: Climate Liability Litigation in the United States,\\u201d p. 2, https://mfgaccountabilityproject.or g/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ \\nMAP-Beyond-the-Courtroom-Chapter-One.pdf \\n17 \\n IV. HISTORIC CONCERNS ABOUT STATE \\nCOURT BIAS ARE AMPLIFIED IN CASES \\nOF THIS TYPE, SUCH THAT FEDERAL \\nCOURTS SHOULD STEP IN TO PROTECT \\nFEDERAL INTERESTS \\n A \\u201chistoric concern about state court bias\\u201d is the \\nunderlying basis allowing for federal officer removal. \\nSavoie v. Huntington Ingalls, Inc. , 817 F.3d 457, 461 \\n(5th Cir. 2016). The Supreme Court also recognizes bias as a concern justifying removal to federal court. \\n\\u201cState-court proceedings may reflect \\u2018local prejudice\\u2019 \\nagainst unpopular federal laws or federal officials.\\u201d Watson v. Philip Morris Cos. , 551 U.S. 142, 150 (2007). \\nBias exists, as these opinions acknowledge, and there \\nis no rational basis for declaring that such bias extends only to parties who are unpopular government offi-\\ncials. Indeed, this Court has  cautioned against \\u201cnarrow, \\ngrudging interpretation\\u201d of federal officer removal. Willingham v. Morgan , 395 U.S. 402, 407 (1969). \\nSimply put, \\u201c[t]he removal statute is an incident of fed-\\neral supremacy.\\u201d Murray v. Murray , 621 F.2d 103, 106 \\n(5th Cir. 1980). \\n States and municipalities are engaged in a cam-\\npaign through the courts to overturn \\u201cunpopular fed-\\neral laws.\\u201d Rather than recognizing the Constitution \\nand federal laws as supreme, governmental \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d plaintiffs are applying \\u201cnarrow, grudging\\u201d \\ninterpretation of the removal statute to seek to over-\\nturn federal law through imposing ostensible tort lia-bility in state courts. \\n18 \\n  It is hard to imagine a more striking case where \\nfear of state court bias could be a concern than is pre-\\nsented in the instant matter and similar cases unfold-\\ning across the nation. Stated otherwise and even more affirmatively, the hope  for state court bias is demon-\\nstrably at play in these case s, as shown in other records \\nobtained by Amicus  EPA through public records laws. \\n As documented, supra , by its own admission the \\nState of Rhode Island is pursuing its litigation to ob-tain a \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d for its officials\\u2019 \\nspending ambitions, having failed to convince the vot-\\ners\\u2019 elected representatives to provide one. Rhode Is-land\\u2019s circumstance in this respect differs not at all \\nfrom all such plaintiffs including in Baltimore . Both \\nsets of notes discussed, supra , specify Director Coit\\u2019s \\nemphasis on seeking this \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d \\nin \\u201cstate court.\\u201d All such plaintiffs are now moving \\nHeaven and earth to keep these matters out of the clutches of federal jurisdiction. \\n This objective of suing to make federal policy in \\nstate courts is a thematic cousin of the drive to use the \\ncourts when legislatures fail to enact plaintiffs\\u2019 desired \\npolicies, and is well-understood among the instant plaintiffs, Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, and by \\nthe legal teams for most similarly-situated govern-\\nment plaintiffs. That Rhode Island and the City of Bal-timore share not only claims and legal strategies but \\nlegal counsel, whose recruit ing team has emphasized \\nto targeted governmental entities the desire to keep these matters in state court as the \\u201cmore advantageous \\nvenue for these cases,\\u201d given this Court\\u2019s ruling in \\n19 \\n American Electric Power , raises concerns that the cli-\\nmate nuisance plaintiffs also  share the hope for state \\ncourt biases in the campaign to eliminate budgetary \\nshortfalls and otherwise make policy through tort liti-gation. \\n For example, and again turning to documents ob-\\ntained through open records laws, we see that, after \\nU.S. District Judge William Alsup dismissed the City \\nof Oakland\\u2019s \\u201cclimate nuisanc e\\u201d suit against many of \\nthe same defendants in June 2018,\\n11 a lobbyist hired to \\nassist with recruiting more governmental plaintiffs for \\nSher Edling12 passed along a note of encouragement to \\n \\n 11 City of Oakland, et al. v. BP P.L.C., et al ., N.D. Cal., Order \\nGranting Motion to Dismiss Amen ded Complaints, Alsup, J., June \\n25, 2018, http://blogs2.law.columbia.edu/climate-change-litigation/ wp-content/uploads/sites/16/case-documents/2018/20180625_docket- 317-cv-06011_order-1.pdf. \\n \\n12 The legal/recruiting team is somewhat involved. G. Seth \\nPlatt is one of the network\\u2019s cons ultants, engaged to help lobby \\nFlorida municipalities to file suit similar to the State\\u2019s. At the time of the correspondence cited herein, Platt was a registered lobbyist for the Institute for Gove rnance & Sustainable Development \\n(\\u201cIGSD\\u201d) (www.igsd.org) (see search able index of lobbying regis-\\ntrations at ftlweb01app.azurewebsites.us/Ethicstrac/Lobbyists.aspx). Platt worked with IGSD and others  pitching municipalities to file \\n\\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation against energy interests, with First Circuit and Fourth Circuit plaintiffs\\u2019 counsel Sher Edling. \\n On July 27, 2018 Fort Lauderdale Interim City Attorney \\nAlain Boileau wrote Mayor Dean Trantalis, copying other aides, in pertinent part: \\n\\u201cMayor . . .

Seth Platt flatly stated (or forwarded) the \\nteam\\u2019s position that state courts are the \\u201cmore advan-\\ntageous venue for these cases.\\u201d14 \\n Mr. Platt then quotes UCLA Law professor and \\nalso consultant to plaintiff \\u2019s counsel Sher Edling,15 \\nAnn Carlson, linking in his email to an article quoting \\nProf. Carlson further on this belief that, for whatever \\nreasons, plaintiffs\\u2019 chances for recovery are much bet-\\nter in state fora.16 And in February a Los Angeles Times  \\n \\n 14 https://climatelitigationwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/ \\n03/GSPlatt-explains-seeks-to-encourage-Fort-Lauderdale-post-Judge-Alsop-Opinion.pdf. While recruiting Fort Lauderdale to file a climate nuisance action similar to the instant matter, Platt of-\\nfered \\u201ccontext for Dean and Alain\\u2019s consideration\\u201d in an email to Mayor Dean Trantalis, City Atto rney Boileau, and Mayor\\u2019s Chief \\nof Staff Scott Wyman. This was specifically in response to U.S. District Judge Alsup\\u2019s June 2018 opinion dismissing certain mu-\\nnicipalities\\u2019 \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation on the grounds that the courts were not the proper place to deal with such global issues.  \\n In another email, City Attorney Alan Boileau writes to \\nMayor Trantalis, \\u201cThe governmental plaintiffs are essentially pursuing liability through common law claims at a local level for a global (and not exclusively do mestic) problem upon which the \\njudiciary is taking the position that the issue has been and should be relegated to the exec utive and legislative branches. \\nhttps://climatelitigationwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ CLK_789_2018-Em ails-2nd-FTL-Production.pdf. \\n \\n15 Matt Dempsey, \\u201cUCLA Professor\\u2019 s Role In Climate Litiga-\\ntion Raises Transparency Questions,\\u201d Western Wire, November 27, 2018, https://westernwire.net/u cla-professors-role-in-climate-\\nlitigation-raises-transparency-questions/. \\n \\n16 \\u201c \\u2018[U.S. District Judge William Alsup\\u2019s] decision is irrele-\\nvant from a legal perspective,\\u2019 Carlson said, as long as these cases stay in state courts.

(\\u201cLDF\\u201d) has strived to secure \\nthe constitutional promise of equality for all people. Petitioner asks the Court to reconsider an important question about the Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s reach, which, more than any other constitutional provision, \\nembodies our Nation\\u2019s commitment to equal justice \\nunder the law.  \\nLDF has been at the forefront of efforts to enforce \\nthe Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s promise of equality. See, e.g. , Cooper v. Aaron , 358 U.S. 1 (1958);\\n Brown v. \\nBd. of Educ. of Topeka , 347 U.S. 483 (1954) . LDF has \\nalso led the fight of eradicating discrimination from jury verdicts. See, e.g. , Ham v. South Carolina , 409 \\nU.S. 524 (1973)\\n; Alexander v. Louisiana , 405 U.S. 625 \\n(1972) ; Swain v. Alabama , 380 U.S. 202 (1965). \\nLDF submits this brief to aid the Court in \\ndeciding whether the Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s Due Process Clause incorporates the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement against the States.\\n1  \\n  \\n                                                \\n1 Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.6, counsel for amicus \\ncuriae state that no counsel for a party authored this brief in \\nwhole or in part and that no person other than amicus curiae , its \\nmembers, or its counsel made a monetary contribution to the preparation or submission of this brief. All parties have consented to the filing of this brief. \\n2 \\n \\n SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \\nAfter the Civil War, Congress passed the \\nFourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of \\n1875 to protect the rights of newly freed African \\nAmericans. One of the rights protected by those provisions was the right to  serve on a jury. Indeed, \\nthis Court affirmed the centrality of jury service to the citizenship of African Americans 140 years ago. See \\nStrauder v. West Virginia , 100 U.S. 303 (1879). \\nThen, in 1898, white Louisianans convened a \\nconstitutional convention. Their goal was to craft a constitution that would \\u201cestablish the supremacy of \\nthe white race . . . to the extent to which it could be \\nlegally and constitutionally done . . . .\\u201d Louisiana \\nratified its non-unanimous jury provision at this convention to help achieve its goal of cementing white supremacy. While federal law made it illegal to exclude Black people from jury service, the delegates \\npassed the non-unanimous jury provision to nullify \\nthe votes of Black jurors and allow white jurors to more easily convict Black defendants. \\nLouisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury provision \\nworked exactly as intended. Up until 2018, when \\nLouisianans voted to remove the non-unanimous jury \\nprovision from their constitution, Black defendants were more likely to be convicted by non-unanimous juries than white defendants, and Black jurors were more likely than white jurors to be in the dissent. \\nThus, despite jury service being a hallmark of \\nAmerican citizenship, for ov er a century, Louisiana\\u2019s \\n3 \\n \\n non-unanimous jury provision effectively undermined \\nBlack participation on juries. \\nLouisiana has been permitted to thwart the \\nintent of the Reconstruction Congress in this manner because of this Court\\u2019s decision in Apodaca v. Oregon , \\n406 U.S. 404 (1972), in which Justice Powell\\u2019s idiosyncratic view that the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement does not apply to the States \\nwas the controlling opinion. Th is is the rare case in \\nwhich stare decisis should not control, and this Court \\nshould hold that the Sixth Amendment requires state juries\\u2014like federal juries\\u2014to be unanimous. \\nARGUMENT \\nI. THE HISTORY OF THE FOURTEENTH \\nAMENDMENT COMPELS THE INCORPORATION OF THE SIXTH AMENDMENT UNANIMOUS JURY TRIAL \\nRIGHT.  \\nThis Court recently reiterated that \\u201c[a] Bill of \\nRights protection is inco rporated . . . if it is \\n\\u2018fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty,\\u2019 or \\n\\u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\\u2019s history and tradition.\\u2019\\u201d  \\nTimbs v. Indiana , 139 S. Ct. 682, 687 (2019) (quoting \\nMcDonald v. Chicago , 561 U.S. 742, 767 (2010)). \\nAccordingly, when determining whether a provision of the Bill of Rights is \\u201cfundamental\\u201d or \\u201cdeeply rooted,\\u201d the Court reckons with the historical context \\nof the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e.g. , McDonald , \\n561 U.S. at 770-78 (explicating the position of \\u201cthe \\n4 \\n \\n Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth \\nAmendment\\u201d); id. at 776 (relying on \\u201c[e]vidence from \\nthe period immediately following the ratification of \\nthe Fourteenth Amendment\\u201d); Timbs , 139 S. Ct. at \\n688 (same). An examination of this history compels the incorporation of the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement. \\nIn the aftermath of the Civil War, Southern \\nwhites were neither prepared nor willing to accept the \\n\\u201cfundamentally altered . . . racial status quo in the \\nSouth.\\u201d\\n2 The Thirteenth Amendment\\u2019s ratification \\nabolished slavery in 1865.3 Nevertheless, recalcitrant \\nSouthern states persisted in \\u201csubjugat[ing] newly \\nfreed slaves and maintain[ing] the prewar racial \\nhierarchy.\\u201d Timbs , 139 S. Ct. at 688. Between  1865 \\nand 1866, Southern legislatures accomplished this by passing discriminatory statutes, known as Black \\nCodes, which \\u201creduce[d] blacks to a status somewhere \\nbetween that of slaves (which they no longer were) \\nand full free people (which most white southerners opposed).\\u201d\\n4 And Black Codes governed a wide range of \\naspects of everyday life, including the extent of African American access to the courtroom.\\n5 For \\n                                                \\n2 Paul Finkelman, John Bingham and the Background to the \\nFourteenth Amendment , 36 Akron L.

In December 1865, Congress created \\nthe Joint Committee on Reconstruction, and \\nauthorized the Committee \\u201cto investigate conditions \\nin the South.\\u201d10  \\nThis investigation showed that with respect to \\nformerly enslaved Black people, \\u201cit was impossible to abandon them, without securing them their rights as \\n                                                \\n(2004).

As this Court said in Duncan v. Louisiana , \\u201c[t]he \\nguarantees of jury trial . . . reflect a profound \\njudgment about the way in which law should be enforced and justice administered.\\u201d 391 U.S. 145, 155 (1968).

See \\nApodaca v. Oregon , 406 U.S. 404, 408 n. 3 (1972).\\n29  As \\nstated in 1788 by Chief Justice M\\u2019Kean of the \\nSupreme Court of Pennsylvania when discussing the \\nstate\\u2019s constitutional provision explicitly requiring unanimous juries, \\u201cI have  always understood it to be the law, independent of this section, that the twelve jurors must be unanimous in their verdict, and yet \\nthis section makes this express provision.\\u201d Respublica \\nv.

LOUISIANA\\u2019S NON-UNANIMOUS JURY \\nPROVISION WAS DESIGNED TO NULLIFY \\nBLACK JURY SERVICE.  \\nDespite the foregoing, a majority of this Court in \\nApodaca  held that the Fourteenth Amendment does \\nnot require the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity rule to \\nbe applied in state trials. In reaching that conclusion, \\nthe Court did not grapple with the racist history of \\nLouisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury provision. Thus, the \\n                                                \\n30 Duncan , 391 U.S. at 155. \\n31 Riordan, supra  note 28, at 1424 (quoting Billeci v. U.S. , 184 \\nF.2d 394, 403 (D.C. Cir. 1950)). \\n32Duncan , 391 U.S. at 155. \\n11 \\n \\n Court failed to appreciate the protections unanimity \\nprovides against racial prejudice infecting jury trials. \\nIn Apodaca , the Petitioners argued \\u201cunanimity \\n[was] a necessary precondition for effective application of the cross-section requirement, because a rule permitting less than  unanimous verdicts will \\nmake it possible for convictions to occur without the acquiescence of minority elements within the \\ncommunity.\\u201d Apodaca , 406 U.S. at 412-13.  \\nJustice White\\u2019s opinion re jected this argument \\nbecause it refused to accept its premise. Id. at 413. \\nJustice White could not \\u201cassume that the majority of \\nthe jury will refuse to weigh the evidence and reach a \\ndecision upon rational grounds . . . or that a majority will deprive a man of his liberty on the basis of prejudice when a minority is presenting a reasonable argument in favor of acquittal.\\u201d Id. Justice White \\n\\u201csimply [found] no proof for the notion that a majority \\nwill disregard its instructions and cast its votes for \\nguilt or innocence based on prejudice rather than \\nevidence.\\u201d Id. at 413-14.  \\nIn so reasoning, Justice White\\u2019s opinion does not \\nreckon with the overwhelming evidence that shows \\nLouisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury provision was \\nenacted with discriminatory intent and was designed to facilitate white jurors being able to convict Black defendants over the dissent of Black jurors.  \\nAfter Reconstruction ended and federal troops left \\nthe South, Louisianan Democrats called a \\n12 \\n \\n Constitutional Convention in 1898.33 As two scholars \\nof this period summarized, \\u201cthe sinister purpose of the Convention was to create a racial architecture in \\nLouisiana that could circumvent the Reconstruction \\nAmendments and marginalize the political power of black citizens.\\u201d\\n34 It was at this Convention that \\nLouisiana ratified its non-unanimous jury \\nprovision.35  \\nThe Convention\\u2019s official record is replete with \\nreferences to its racist goals.

The thought of Black defendants being acquitted was untenable to white Louisianans. As one local paper acknowledged, \\u201cin some of the parishes of the State the hostility to \\nthe negro is . . . such . . . that . . . juries in these \\nbenighted localities seem to think that it is their \\nbounden duty to render a verdict of \\u2018guilty as charged,\\u2019 because the accused has black skin.\\u201d\\n49 White \\nLouisianans believed a non-unanimous jury provision \\nwould address this fear by ensuring white jurors\\u2019 \\nability to convict Black defendants over the dissent of Black jurors.\\n50  \\nBy contrast, white Louisianans feared that if \\nBlack men served on juries, Black defendants \\u201cwould \\nsimply not be convicted because of the African-\\nAmerican presence in the jury box.\\u201d51 After the \\nFourteenth Amendment was ratified, one popular newspaper lamented that \\u201cif a negro be on trial for any crime, [a Black juror] becomes at once his earnest \\n                                                \\n47 Id. at 375 (quoting Future of the Freedman , Daily Picayune, \\nAug. 31, 1873, at 5). \\n48 Id. at 376. \\n49 See Frampton, supra note 25 at 1603 (quoting Prejudiced \\nVerdicts , Opelousas Courier, Oct. 26, 1985, at 1). \\n50 See Smith & Sarma, supra note 33 at 375-76.   \\n51 Id. at 375.  \\n16 \\n \\n champion, and a hung jury is the usual result.\\u201d52 A \\nfew years before the 1898 Convention, the same paper \\u201cendorsed the adoption of nonunanimous verdicts\\u201d to \\navoid hung juries.\\n53 The paper claimed such a \\nprovision was needed to avoid \\u201cpopular justice\\u201d\\u2014the mob lynchings that often occurred when Black \\ndefendants were acquitted.\\n54 The article reasoned \\nthat guilty verdicts \\u201cplacat[ed] those intent on \\ncommitting extralegal form s of racial violence.\\u201d55 The \\npaper concluded that a non-unanimous jury provision was needed to ensure that \\u201cone partisan\\u201d (read: Black person) on the jury does not \\u201cdisappoint or obstruct justice.\\u201d\\n56 \\nThe history of Louisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury \\nprovision is important to an incorporation analysis and is the \\u201cproof\\u201d Justice White thought lacking that \\nshows unanimity is required to ensure convictions are \\nnot \\u201cbased on prejudice rather than evidence.\\u201d \\nApodaca , 406 U.S. at 413-14.  \\nIII.

The story of two Black Louisianans who recently served as jurors\\u2014Willie Newton and Bobbie Howard\\u2014compellingly illustrates this point.\\n64 \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard were both born and \\nraised in the small town of Houma, in Terrebonne Parish; the same town where Evangelisto Ramos \\nworked. Mr. Newton, who is 72 years old, runs a \\nfamily business selling burial vaults.

Everything quoted is from their interviews with counsel unless attributed otherwise. \\n19 \\n \\n year-old Mr. Howard has his own accounting practice. \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard both attended segregated schools growing up. In fact, they went to \\nthe same high school, as there was only one in the \\nParish that educated Black children. \\nIn 2014, two years before Mr. Ramos faced trial \\nfor second-degree murder, Mr. Newton and Mr. Howard were selected to serve on the jury for the trial \\nof Matthew Allen, a 20-year-old Black man also \\naccused of second-degree murder. The prosecution\\u2019s \\ntheory was that Mr. Allen intentionally shot and killed the victim; Mr. Allen\\u2019 s defense to the charge \\nwas that he acted in self-defense.\\n65 Mr. Newton and \\nMr. Howard were the only Black jurors. The other ten \\njurors on Mr. Allen\\u2019s jury were white.  \\nMr. Newton vividly recalled  his feelings when he \\nsaw the jury\\u2019s composition: \\u201cBobby and I saw from the beginning that our vote wasn\\u2019t going to matter. We \\nwere outnumbered.\\u201d \\u201cI could have just stayed home.\\u201d \\n\\u201cAin\\u2019t no difference we can make.\\u201d Mr. Newton felt \\ndoubly distraught when he saw that Mr. Allen had a \\u201cbad judge\\u201d who had been reprimanded for wearing blackface.\\n66 Mr. Newton thought to himself, \\u201cBuddy, \\nyou\\u2019re doomed.\\u201d \\n                                                \\n65 See State v. Allen , 2015-0675, 2015 WL 6951570, at *2 (La. Ct. \\nApp. 2015).  \\n66 In 2004, Judge Timothy Ellender was suspended for wearing \\nblackface, handcuffs, and a jail jumpsuit to a Halloween party.  \\nSee Seth Fox, Houma Judge Suspended for Wearing Blackface \\nHalloween Costume , Houma Today (Dec. 13, 2014), \\n20 \\n \\n Reflecting back, Mr. Newton and Mr. Howard \\nthought Mr. Allen\\u2019s race worked against him with the white jurors. \\u201cThey see a Black defendant in a drug \\ndeal and maybe think \\u2018he\\u2019s hustling corner to corner, \\nlet\\u2019s teach him a lesson,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Howard speculated. Mr. Newton echoed this sentiment: \\u201cI think they saw him \\nas a potential threat to the community.\\u201d  \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard looked at Mr. Allen \\ndifferently. They saw a young man who may have \\nmade a mistake, but who still had a life ahead of him. \\nMr. Howard thought these differing perspectives could be due to the fact \\u201ctheir life experiences were different.\\u201d  \\nAfter listening intently to the evidence, both Mr. \\nHoward and Newton favored finding Mr. Allen guilty of manslaughter. \\u201cI thought about his age. I thought he deserved a second chance,\\u201d Mr. Howard said quietly. Mr. Newton confirmed that he \\u201cnever thought \\nit was second-degree murder\\u201d and proposed to his \\nfellow jurors that Mr. Allen should be convicted of \\nmanslaughter, not murder.  \\nDeliberations gave both men hope that at least \\nsome of the white jurors would see the evidence their \\nway and would find Mr. Allen guilty of manslaughter, \\nnot murder. Mr. Howard recalled that one juror, a white woman, seemed to be leaning in favor of manslaughter going into lunch. Mr. Newton remembered there being two or three white jurors \\n                                                \\nhttps://www.houmatoday.com/article/DA/20041213/News/60809\\n9465/HC/.   \\n21 \\n \\n who seemed to think manslaughter was the just \\nconviction. \\nThings took a turn after lunch, however. Mr. \\nHoward recounted that he and Mr. Newton had lunch together, while the white jurors ate together. When they returned from lunch, all ten white jurors wanted to vote for second-degree murder; there was no convincing them otherwise, \\u201ceveryone was set in their \\nways.\\u201d  \\nMr. Newton\\u2019s prediction that his vote wouldn\\u2019t \\nmatter proved prescient. Th e jury convicted Mr. Allen \\nof second-degree murder by a vote of 10-2. All ten \\nwhite jurors voted for guilt. Mr. Newton and Mr. \\nHoward voted not guilty. \\nWhat took place troubled Mr. Howard and Mr. \\nNewton. Mr. Howard recalled: \\u201cI pretty much felt sorry for the young man, to tell you the truth.\\u201d Mr. \\nNewton was more shaken: \\u201cIt hurt me real bad when \\nI looked at that young man, and I looked at his mother and father, and I knew they weren\\u2019t going to see him again, not unless they go up to Angola.\\u201d\\n67 Indeed, Mr. \\nNewton felt the effects of the trial long after it was \\nover: \\u201cWhen I left that jury, it took me a couple of \\nweeks to get myself together. Serving on that jury \\ntook something out of me.\\u201d Mr. Allen, who entered prison for a crime he a when he was only 20, continues to serve a life sentence in Angola Prison.   \\n                                                \\n67 Adelson et al., supra note 57. \\n22 \\n \\n Mr. Newton realized that what happened in Mr. \\nAllen\\u2019s trial probably happened in many others, causing him to wonder, \\u201cHow many others had passed \\nthis way . . . and got the same treatment this boy got.\\u201d \\nThe trial, Mr. Newton explained, made him feel like his \\u201cvoice didn\\u2019t matter,\\u201d \\u201ca second-class citizen.\\u201d  \\nThis experience confirmed for Mr. Newton that \\nLouisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury system was unfair to \\nBlack defendants and Black jurors. In his opinion, the \\nprosecutors \\u201cfound a way to get around the system\\u201d \\nby limiting the number of Black people on Mr. Allen\\u2019s jury to two, knowing they only needed ten votes for a conviction. The trial shook Mr. Newton\\u2019s confidence in \\nthe fairness of Louisiana\\u2019s justice system: \\u201cI know I \\ncouldn\\u2019t sit there and think I\\u2019d get a fair trial.\\u201d  \\nMr. Newton took solace in the fact Louisiana \\nvoters repealed the non-unanimous jury provision last year.\\n68 He expressed that while he does think that \\n\\u201cjustice was served\\u201d during Mr. Allen\\u2019s trial, he felt \\n\\u201cencouraged\\u201d and \\u201cempowered\\u201d to serve on a jury now that his vote was guaranteed to matter. Mr. Howard \\nsaid that he, too, is ready to perform his \\u201ccivic duty\\u201d \\nand serve on a jury under Louisiana\\u2019s new unanimous jury scheme.  \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard\\u2019s experience is a \\nstark example of the indign ities inflicted upon Black \\npeople by Louisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury provision. It is a reminder that, until last year, Louisiana\\u2019s non-\\nunanimous jury system worked the way its racist \\n                                                \\n68 Oregon is now the only state with a non-unanimous jury \\nprovision. \\n23 \\n \\n proponents intended\\u2014to more easily convict Black \\ndefendants and to silence Black jurors. What makes this even worse, is that this system, conceived from \\nracism, has been operating with this Court\\u2019s blessing \\nfor 47 years. Apodaca must be overruled. This Court \\nshould hold that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity \\nrequirement against the States.  \\n \\n  \\n24 \\n \\n CONCLUSION \\nLDF respectfully urges this Court to hold that the \\nFourteenth Amendment incorporates the Sixth \\nAmendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement against the States.  \\nRespectfully submitted,  \\n \\nSherrilyn A.

As a non-profit organization, the \\nCatholic League is dedicated to safeguarding the \\nreligious freedom and free speech rights of Catholics \\nwhenever and wherever they are threatened. Both \\nthe letter and spirit of the First Amendment \\nmotivate every aspect of the Catholic League\\u2019s work defending the right of all Catholics\\u2014lay and clergy \\nalike\\u2014to participate in American public life without \\ndefamation or discrimination. \\nTo advance these efforts, the Catholic League \\nsubmits this brief in support of the Petitioners. \\n  \\n                                           \\n1 Pursuant to Rule 37.3(a), both the Petitioners and the \\nRespondents have provided blanket consents to the filing of \\namicus briefs.

While debating the extent to \\nwhich the Constitution should enshrine protections for religious freedom during the First Congress, \\nRepresentative Daniel Carroll of Maryland\\u2014one of \\nthe few Catholics among the Constitution\\u2019s \\nFramers\\u2014remarked \\u201cthe rights of conscience are, in \\ntheir nature, of peculiar delicacy, and will little bear \\nthe gentlest touch of governmental hand.\\u201d 1 Annals \\nof Cong. 757-58 (Joseph Gales ed., 1834) (Aug. 15, 1789). \\nNowhere are the rights of the religious more \\ndelicate than when they intersect with the freedom \\nto put faith into action, belief into words. If the \\nrobust religious freedom protections guaranteed by \\nour Constitution are to have any meaning, they must \\nbe capable of shielding a sincere religious believer from being coerced into speaking against the core \\ntenants of her faith. To hold otherwise would be to \\npermit the heavy hand of government to extinguish \\nreligious practice. This the Constitution will not \\nallow. \\nThe Founders understood that the First \\nAmendment, as drafted, protected all religious sects in their right to speak freely in accordance with t\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"gpt_response_1\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3977,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"(I) QUESTION PRESENTED\\n(III) TABLE OF CONTENTS\\nStatement of interest\\nRelevant statutory provisions\\nIntroduction\\nStatement\\nA.

As a non-profit organization, the \\nCatholic League is dedicated to safeguarding the \\nreligious freedom and free speech rights of Catholics \\nwhenever and wherever they are threatened. Both \\nthe letter and spirit of the First Amendment \\nmotivate every aspect of the Catholic League\\u2019s work defending the right of all Catholics\\u2014lay and clergy \\nalike\\u2014to participate in American public life without \\ndefamation or discrimination. \\nTo advance these efforts, the Catholic League \\nsubmits this brief in support of the Petitioners. \\n  \\n                                           \\n1 Pursuant to Rule 37.3(a), both the Petitioners and the \\nRespondents have provided blanket consents to the filing of \\namicus briefs.

While debating the extent to \\nwhich the Constitution should enshrine protections for religious freedom during the First Congress, \\nRepresentative Daniel Carroll of Maryland\\u2014one of \\nthe few Catholics among the Constitution\\u2019s \\nFramers\\u2014remarked \\u201cthe rights of conscience are, in \\ntheir nature, of peculiar delicacy, and will little bear \\nthe gentlest touch of governmental hand.\\u201d 1 Annals \\nof Cong. 757-58 (Joseph Gales ed., 1834) (Aug. 15, 1789). \\nNowhere are the rights of the religious more \\ndelicate than when they intersect with the freedom \\nto put faith into action, belief into words. If the \\nrobust religious freedom protections guaranteed by \\nour Constitution are to have any meaning, they must \\nbe capable of shielding a sincere religious believer from being coerced into speaking against the core \\ntenants of her faith. To hold otherwise would be to \\npermit the heavy hand of government to extinguish \\nreligious practice. This the Constitution will not \\nallow. \\nThe Founders understood that the First \\nAmendment, as drafted, protected all religious sects in their right to speak freely in accordance with their \\nfaith. Indeed, the Founding Generation believed \\nprotections for religious lib erty to be of utmost \\nimport. Since its founding, America has been gripped \\n 3 \\nin debate over religious liberty. Even before the \\ncolonies declared their independence, there were \\nenergetic discussions over the bounds of religious \\ntoleration versus a full freedom to exercise religion \\n(with only limited exceptions). Ultimately, the \\nConstitution\\u2019s drafters settled on James Madison\\u2019s \\nview of an unalienable right to practice one\\u2019s \\nreligious faith. Owed to an understanding that the Governor of the Universe supersedes any earthly \\nauthority, religious convictions were understood to \\ncommand greater deference than mere personal \\nopinions. Where opinion was required to yield to the \\nlaw, tensions between law and religious belief often \\nresulted in exemption for the believer. \\nThe Founding Generation also viewed religious \\nliberty as encompassing more  than mere matters of \\nconscience or decisions on the rightness or wrongness \\nof acts. Instead, the full ex ercise of religion offered a \\nright to act in accordance with one\\u2019s faith and, \\nnecessarily, included protection from government \\ncompelled speech that violated a believer\\u2019s firmly \\nheld religious convictions. This distinction was \\nperhaps most clearly expressed in the early colonies\\u2019 \\nanti-Catholic prejudices. In colonial Georgia, for example, while all worshipers were vested by its \\nCharter with a liberty of conscience, Catholics were \\nexpressly excluded from protections for the more \\nrobust free exercise of religion. McConnell, The \\nOrigins and Historical Understanding of Free \\nExercise of Religion, 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1409, 1489-90 \\n(1989) (hereinafter McConnell, Origins). \\nInformed by the debates and experiences of their \\ntime, the Founders opted to include among the Constitution\\u2019s protections the more extensive free \\n 4 \\nexercise of religion. In so doing, they extended the \\nmaximum protections available to all who professed \\nbelief in a Universal Sovereign. These protections, it \\nwas understood, included a right to act out belief and \\nto speak, or refrain from speaking, freely, in \\naccordance with faith. \\nWith this understanding as background, it is \\nclear the First Amendment provides dual protections for religious expression (or non-expression) in its \\nguarantees of free speech and free religious exercise. \\nThis reality compels the conclusion that religious \\nspeech enjoys the highest constitutional protection. \\nCertainly, this is consistent with the Founders\\u2019 \\nunderstanding of robust religious liberty protections, \\nas revealed in the text, history, and tradition of the First Amendment. \\nThis Court\\u2019s recent religious liberty jurisprudence \\nconcurs with the Founders\\u2019 view of full-throated \\nreligious liberty protection. Religious observers have \\nwelcomed the relief from government oppression. No \\nlonger can religious believers be excluded solely \\nbecause of their religious identity. Free are the religious to express their religious views without fear \\nof government reprisal. This Court\\u2019s precedents have \\nbeen unequivocal: if government can achieve its \\nmeans without burdening religion, the Constitution \\nalmost always requires that it must. \\nAnother truism is derived from this Court\\u2019s \\nprecedents. When religious liberty concerns are coupled with free expression, the Constitution \\ndemands the most exacting scrutiny. That is because \\nthe First Amendment, as understood from the \\nFounding, provides special protection for the \\n 5 \\nreligious, their right to speak freely, and their right \\nto refrain from speaking. Distinct from pure \\ncommercial speech, religious speech demands a \\nhigher constitutional protection. That is why, to \\nAmicus Curiae\\u2019s knowledge, government compelled \\nreligious speech has never been held to survive strict \\nscrutiny. \\nAgainst this backdrop, the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s opinion \\ncannot stand. Although purporting to apply strict scrutiny, the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s analysis is rife with \\nflaws, each one fatal to the court\\u2019s conclusion. From \\nthe outset, the Tenth Circuit failed to recognize the \\npreferred status of Ms. Smith\\u2019s free speech rights, \\ngrounded as they are in her religious beliefs. This \\nfailure is only compounded by the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s lethargic narrow-tailoring analysis. Far from the \\nexacting analysis this Court requires, the Tenth \\nCircuit settles into a now familiar pattern to those of \\nfaith\\u2014ostracizing Ms. Smith from society because of \\nher religious identity. \\nOnce again, this Court must reverse yet another \\nassault on religious freedom by declaring that where, as here, free speech and religion intersect, \\nconstitutional protections are at their greatest. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 6 \\nARGUMENT \\nI. AS ORIGINALLY UNDERSTOOD , THE FIRST \\nAMENDMENT PROTECTED THE RIGHT OF THE \\nRELIGIOUS TO SPEAK AND TO REMAIN SILENT . \\nThe First Amendment is \\u201cunique in form among \\namendments to the Constitution.\\u201d2 It is drafted, not \\nas a grant of privileges or rights to the people, but as \\na disability on Congress\\u2019 ability to act. Report to the Attorney General, supra  note 2, at 15\\u201316. In its \\nentirety, the First Amendment reads: \\nCongress shall make no law respecting \\nan establishment of religion, or \\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; or \\nabridging the freedom of speech, or of \\nthe press; or the right of the people \\npeaceably to assemble, and to petition \\nthe Government for a redress of grievances.  \\nU.S.\\n Const., Amdt. 1. \\nIn barring certain kinds of laws, the First \\nAmendment recognizes a pre-existing \\u201cimmun[ity] from such legislative action.\\u201d Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral, supra note 2, at 16. This reflects an \\nunderstanding by the Founding Generation that these \\u201care pre-existent rights\\u2014inalienable rights\\u2014\\n                                           \\n2 O f f i c e  o f  L e g a l  P o l i c y ,  D e p t  o f  J u s t i c e ,  R e p o r t  t o  t h e  \\nAttorney General: Religious Li berty Under the Free Exercise \\nClause at 15 (1986) (hereinafter Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral). \\n 7 \\nand not mere civil privileges conferred by a \\nbenevolent sovereign.\\u201d Id. \\nTaken together, the text, history, and philosophy \\nof the First Amendment establish the principle that \\n\\u201cthe government has no right to interfere with the \\nfree exercise of religion\\u201d unless the \\u201cgovernment \\naction is necessary to prevent manifest danger to the \\nexistence of the state; to protect public peace, safety, \\nand order; or to secure the religious liberty of \\nothers.\\u201d Id., at v. And, even then, only if the \\ngovernment deploys \\u201cthe least restrictive means \\nnecessary to protect these interests.\\u201d Id. This is true \\nas a matter of the First Amendment\\u2019s Religious Liberty Clauses. And because freedom of religion \\ncannot be divorced from freedom of expression, it is \\neven more true when the government tries to force a \\nbeliever to speak in a way that cannot be reconciled \\nwith her religious convictions. \\nA. Religious liberty was profoundly \\nimportant to the Founding Generation; \\nreligious convictions were understood \\nto receive greater deference than mere \\npersonal opinion. \\n1. The Founding Generation was uniquely \\nattuned to issues regarding the proper relationship \\nbetween religion and government. Indeed, at the time of America\\u2019s founding there was \\u201can intense and \\ncontroversial theoretical debate\\u201d of these issues \\ninvolving \\u201c[m]ost of the great political thinkers of the \\nperiod.\\u201d McConnell, Origins, at 1430. These thinkers \\ninformed the Founders\\u2019 own debates on the issue and \\nundoubtedly \\u201cinfluenced the American solution to \\nthe problem.\\u201d Id.  \\n 8 \\nJohn Locke, perhaps more than any other \\nphilosopher who contributed to the ideas \\nunderpinning America\\u2019s founding, provided the \\n\\u201cmost extensive\\u201d discussion of religion and most \\ndirectly influenced the Framers\\u2019 drafting of the First \\nAmendment. Id. Locke was an early and influential \\ntheoretical thinker and advocate for religious freedom. Id., at 1431. In his view \\u201creligious rivalry \\nand intolerance\\u201d were \\u201camong the most important of political problems,\\u201d and \\u201c[r]eligious intolerance was inconsistent both with public peace and with good \\ngovernment.\\u201d Id. \\nLocke\\u2019s solution, however, was an \\u201cunderstanding \\nof religious toleration,\\u201d that \\u201cexpressly precludes free \\nexercise exemptions.\\u201d Id., at 1435. To Locke, when \\n\\u201cindividual conscience conflicts with the governmental policy, the government will always \\nprevail and the individual will always be forced to \\nsubmit or suffer the punishment.\\u201d Id. Locke\\u2019s \\ninfluence on the drafters of the First Amendment makes it all the more remarkable that his view did \\nnot triumph with America\\u2019s founding. \\nThe American Revolution upended the \\npreexisting relationship between religion and government, especially in states where the Anglican \\nChurch had the most influence. Id., at 1436. \\n\\u201cAmerica was in the wake of a great religious \\nrevival,\\u201d that brought with it a \\u201cdrive for religious \\nfreedom.\\u201d Id., at 1437\\u201338. Along with this drive came \\na push from \\u201creligious supporters of disestablishment and free exercise\\u201d to enshrine \\n\\u201cconstitutional protections\\u201d for religious freedoms \\u201cat the federal level.\\u201d Id., at 1440. \\n 9 \\nThis movement was encapsulated in debate \\nsurrounding the religious liberty clause in Virginia\\u2019s \\n1776 Bill of Rights. When George Mason proposed \\nusing the Lockean phrase \\u201ctoleration of religion,\\u201d \\nJames Madison objected, complaining that the \\nphrase implied an act of legislative grace (which, to \\nLocke, it did). Id. , at 1443. Madison was not alone \\namong the Founding Generation in rejecting this concept. George Washin gton and Thomas Paine \\nsimilarly eschewed \\u201ctoleration,\\u201d decrying its \\nimplication of government \\u201cindulgence\\u201d rather than a \\nfundamental, preexisting right. Id., at 1443\\u201344. \\nMoreover, Madison objected to Mason\\u2019s proposal \\nbecause it excepted from even the \\u201ctoleration\\u201d of \\nreligious freedom any instance where \\u201cunder color of \\nreligion any man disturb the peace, the happiness, or \\nsafety of society.\\u201d See G. Hunt, James Madison and \\nReligious Liberty, 1 Ann. Rep. Am. Hist. A. 163, 166 \\n(1901). It was Madison\\u2019s belief that such phrasing \\n\\u201cmight easily be so twisted as to oppress religious \\nsects under the excuse that they disturbed \\u2018the \\npeace, the happiness, or safety of society.\\u2019\\u201d Id. \\nMadison\\u2019s objections were heard by Virginia\\u2019s \\nassembly. As adopted, Virginia\\u2019s Bill of Rights \\npromised that all \\u201care equally entitled to the free \\nexercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience,\\u201d and reminded only \\u201cthat\\n it is the mutual \\nduty of all to practice Christian forbearance, love, and charity towards each other.\\u201d Report to the \\nAttorney General, supra  note 2, at 102\\u201303. \\n2. This early debate between Madison and Mason \\nbears witness to what this Court has long noted\\u2014\\nthat Madison was \\u201cthe leading architect of the \\n 10\\nreligion clauses of the First Amendment.\\u201d Hosanna-\\nTabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v. \\nEEOC , 565 U.S. 171, 184 (2012) (internal quotation \\nmarks omitted). Madison\\u2019s rejection of religious \\ntolerance in favor of full and free religious expression permeates his Memorial and Remonstrance . \\nExplaining that \\u201c[t]he Religion then of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every \\nman,\\u201d Madison understood that it is not just \\u201cthe \\nright of every man to exercise it as these may \\ndictate,\\u201d but further \\u201cthe duty of every man to render \\nto the Creator such homage, and such only, as he \\nbelieves to be acceptable to him.\\u201d J. Madison, \\nMemorial and Remonstrance \\u00a7 1 (1785), reprinted in \\nEverson v. Bd. of Educ. , 330 U.S. 1, 64 (1947). This \\nright, Madison admonished, \\u201cis in its nature an unalienable right.\\u201d Id. \\nMadison expounded his view that \\u201c[t]his duty is \\nprecedent both in order of time and degree of \\nobligation, to the claims of Civil Society.\\u201d Id. Before \\nanyone is \\u201ca member of Civil Society,\\u201d they are \\u201cconsidered as a subject of the Governor of the \\nUniverse.\\u201d Id. For this reason, \\u201cin matters of \\nReligion, no man\\u2019s right is abridged by the institution of Civil Society.\\u201d Id. But Madison went \\nfurther. \\u201c[I]f religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that \\nof the Legislative Body.\\u201d Id., at \\u00a7 2, reprinted in \\nEverson , 330 U.S., at 65. Legislators who \\n\\u201cencroach[]\\u201d on the rights of the people, Madison \\nsaid, \\u201cexceed the commission from which they derive their authority, and are Tyrants.\\u201d Id. \\nRecognizing that Madison\\u2019s Memorial and \\nRemonstrance is not law, see City of Boerne v. Flores , \\n 11\\n521 U.S. 507, 541 (1997) (Scalia, J., concurring), it \\nnonetheless offers a clear understanding of why the \\nFounding Generation thought it so crucial to \\nmemorialize the inalienable freedom of religion in \\nthe First Amendment. And Madison\\u2019s defense of the \\nAmerican conception of religious liberty merely \\nechoed the prevalent thought at the founding \\u201cof the \\ndifference between religious faith and other forms of human judgment.\\u201d McConnell, Origins, at 1496. \\nAt the Founding, the prevailing view was that the \\n\\u201copinions of individuals\\u201d can not take \\u201cprecedence \\nover the decisions of civil society.\\u201d Id. The same was \\nnot true for religious convictions. \\u201cConflicts arising from religious convictions were conceived not as a \\nclash between the judgment of the individual and of \\nthe state, but as a conflict between earthly and \\nspiritual sovereigns.\\u201d Id. In those instances, the \\nperson holding the religious conviction \\u201cwas not seen as the instigator of the conflict; the believer was simply caught between the inconsistent demands of \\ntwo rightful authorities, through no fault of his own.\\u201d \\nId. This view is essential to understanding the \\nFounders\\u2019 belief that \\u201cfreedom of religion is unalienable because it is a duty to God and not a \\nprivilege of the individual.\\u201d Id., at 1497. \\n3. Bolstering this understanding, the historical \\nrecord surrounding adoption of the Bill of Rights \\nsuggests that the First Amendment\\u2019s use of the term \\u201creligion\\u201d was a deliberate choice. See McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1488. Although \\u201c[t]he recorded debates \\nin\\u201d both chambers of Congress \\u201ccast little light on the \\nmeaning of the free exercise clause,\\u201d looking at \\nsuccessive drafts of the clause from its consideration \\nand debate in the First Congress are especially \\n 12\\nenlightening. Id., at 1481, 1483. While earlier drafts \\nof the First Amendment used the phrase \\u201crights of \\nconscience,\\u201d the final version that emerged enshrined in the First Amendment a protection for the \\u201cfree \\nexercise of religion.\\u201d Id., at 1488. This phrasing lends \\nfurther support to the Founders\\u2019 understanding of religious freedoms. \\nTo the Founders, \\u201c[b]elief in a Supreme Being \\nwas\\u201d essential to \\u201creligion.\\u201d Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral, supra  note 2, at 9. Indeed, \\u201c[t]he historical \\nmaterials uniformly equate \\u2018religion\\u2019 with belief in God or in gods.\\u201d McConnell, Origins, at 1493. These references \\u201ccan be extended without distortion to \\ntranscendent extrapersonal authorities not \\nenvisioned in traditionally theistic terms\\u201d\\u2014for \\nexample, Madison\\u2019s use of \\u201cCreator,\\u201d \\u201cGovernor of \\nthe Universe,\\u201d and \\u201cUniversal Sovereign,\\u201d imply \\u201can attempt at a definition more compendious than the \\nfamiliar Judeo-Christian God, but it retains the distinction between transcendent authority and \\npersonal judgment.\\u201d Id.  \\nReligion, as understood by the Founders and \\nexpressed in the First Amendment, then, is best \\ndefined to encompass \\u201ca system of beliefs, whether \\npersonally or institutionally held, prompted by the \\nacceptance of transcendent realities or \\nacknowledging extratemporal actions.\\u201d Report to the \\nAttorney General, supra note 2, at 26\\u201327. This \\ninterpretation of religion is both accurate to the Founders\\u2019 understanding and consistent with their view that religion encompasses \\u201cduties that were \\nbeyond the jurisdiction of the state either to \\nprescribe or to proscribe.\\u201d Id., at 9. To the Founders, \\nreligion encompassed a subservience to a \\n 13\\n\\u201ctranscendent reality,\\u201d which if abandoned could \\nunleash \\u201cextratemporal consequences.\\u201d Id., at 29. \\nThis explains their motivation to preserve a robust freedom from government \\u201cinterfere[nce] with such \\nbeliefs or duties.\\u201d Id. \\nB. The Founding Generation\\u2019s understanding of religious liberty \\nencompassed protection for believers \\nfrom compelled speech that violates \\nfirmly held religious beliefs. \\n1. The least controversial point about the phrase \\n\\u201cfree exercise\\u201d is that \\u201cby definition, the words denote action or activity.\\u201d Id., at 19. To the Founders, \\nreligious liberty undoubtedly included \\u201creligiously motivated conduct  as well as belief.\\u201d McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1488 (emphasis added). This point bears emphasis because of this Court\\u2019s history rejecting \\nsuch a reading. See  Reynolds v. United States , 98 \\nU.S. 145, 164 (1878); but see Fulton v. City of Phila. , \\n141 S. Ct. 1868, 1913 (2021) (Alito, J., concurring) \\n(noting \\u201c[t]he Court ha[s] repudiated that distinction\\u201d in Reynolds  \\u201cthat the Free Exercise \\nClause protects beliefs, not conduct\\u201d). \\nIn substituting the \\u201crights of conscience\\u201d in favor \\nof a protection for the \\u201cfree exercise of religion,\\u201d the \\nFramer\\u2019s chose a phrase that \\u201cstrongly connoted \\naction,\\u201d in place of one that suggested mere opinion \\nor belief. McConnell, Origins, at 1489. Leading \\ndictionaries of that era defined \\u201cexercise\\u201d to include \\n\\u201c[l]abour of the body,\\u201d \\u201c[t]ask; that which one is \\nappointed to perform,\\u201d \\u201c[a]ct of divine worship, \\nwhether public or private,\\u201d or \\u201c[t]o use or practice.\\u201d See id.  (collecting dictionary definitions). Conscience, \\n 14\\non the other hand, was more likely to imply a \\n\\u201cnatural knowledge, or the faculty that decides on \\nthe right or wrong of actions.\\u201d Id. (quoting N. \\nWebster, A Dictionary of The English Language 301 (New Haven 1807)). \\nParticularly instructive on this distinction is the \\nGeorgia Charter of 1732. The Charter included \\u201ca \\nliberty of conscience allowe d in the worship of God, \\nto all persons,\\u201d but reserved the more exclusive right to \\u201ca free exercise of religion,\\u201d only to \\u201call such persons, except papists.\\u201d Id., at 1489\\u201390. By granting \\nCatholics only a liberty of conscience, but not the free exercise of religion, the Georgia Charter necessarily \\nreserved a fuller right to non-Catholic worshipers. \\nOne scholar has observed that \\u201c[t]he most plausible \\nreading of the provision is that it permitted Catholics \\nto believe what they wished . . . but did not permit \\nthem to put their faith into action.\\u201d Id., at 1490. \\nBy including a full and robust \\u201cfree exercise of \\nreligion\\u201d within the First Amendment, the Founders understood that they were protecting not only the \\nright for the religious to believe what their faith \\ntaught, but to put those beliefs into action. To \\nconclude otherwise would be to \\u201ctrivialize the idea of \\nreligion by separating thought from life, faith from \\nworks.\\u201d Report to the Attorney General, supra note \\n2, at 31. Possessing \\u201ca right to believe something in one\\u2019s mind without the freedom to utter it, advocate it, or even translate it into life,\\u201d is hardly a \\nsubstantive freedom at all. Id., at 31\\u201332. \\n2. Consistent with the Founders\\u2019 understanding \\nof a robust religious liberty protection that included \\nthe right to act out your faith was the axiom that \\n 15\\naction naturally includes expression or the freedom \\nto refrain from expression that conflicts with belief. \\nAlthough early religious liberty controversies were \\nrelatively limited, the historical record includes \\nexamples of protections for religious exercise \\nintertwined with such expressive activity. \\nAn early source of common conflict, for example, \\narose around the issue of oath requirements. Oaths \\nserved as \\u201cthe principal means of ensuring honest \\ntestimony and solemnizing obligations.\\u201d McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1467. But many early religious sects \\nrefused to take an oath, believing it was in conflict \\nwith the teachings of the New Testament.3 Id. \\nBecause oaths were required before court testimony, this refusal often left these sincere religious objectors \\nwithout access to the court system. Id. \\nIn response, many of the early colonies adopted \\nalternatives, allowing relig ious dissenters to take a \\npledge or make an affirmation rather than to swear \\nan oath. Id., at 1467\\u201368 (\\u201cBy 1789, virtually all of the \\nstates had enacted oath exemptions.\\u201d). This simple solution permitted religious sects access to the court \\nsystem, without requiring them to act out of step \\n                                           \\n3 See Matthew 5:33-37 (\\u201cAgain, ye have heard that it hath \\nbeen said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, \\nbut shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: But I say unto you, \\nSwear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: Nor \\nby the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is \\nthe city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy \\nhead, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever \\nis more than these cometh of evil.\\u201d). \\n 16\\nwith their religious beliefs or to make an expression \\nthey found incompatible with their faith. \\nA still more extreme example of laws yielding to \\nexpressive activities of religious sects in the \\nFounding Generation can be found in colonial \\nGeorgia. There, the Trus tees of Georgia granted \\ncertain groups of religious refugees a general exemption from the laws that allowed them \\u201cto organize themselves in accordance with their own \\nfaith.\\u201d Id., at 1471. One historia n described one such \\ngroup from Salzburg\\u2014which formed the town of Ebenezer\\u2014as \\u201ca state within a state, a sort of \\ntheocracy under the direction of their minsters with \\ndaily conferences of the entire congregation in which \\nGod\\u2019s guidance was invoked at the beginning and the \\nend.\\u201d Id. Although these groups where required to \\nobey certain colonial laws pertaining to military service, property, and good governance, they were \\n\\u201cotherwise free to govern themselves.\\u201d Id. at 1471 \\nn.312 \\nAnother founding era example of religious \\nexemptions for expressive action appeared in North \\nCarolina and Maryland. There, laws exempted \\nmembers of certain religious sects from a \\nrequirement to remove their hat in court. Id. The \\nreligious objectors viewed such an action as \\u201ca form of obeisance to secular authority forbidden by their \\nreligion.\\u201d Id., at 1472. Rather than forcing members \\nof these sects to choose be tween access to the courts \\nor expressing themselves in violation of their religious beliefs, states offered an exemption. \\nWhile this example may seem trivial by today\\u2019s \\nstandards, it was very mu ch on the minds of the \\n 17\\nFounding Generation. At the time, \\u201c[o]ne of the most \\nnotorious courtroom cases of religious intolerance in \\nEngland involved William Penn\\u2019s refusal to remove \\nhis hat when he appeared in court\\u201d to face \\nindictment for speaking to  an unlawful assembly. Id. \\nWhen Penn refused to remove a court-furnished hat from his head in respect to the court, he was held in \\ncontempt and imprisoned. Id. This case attracted \\nsignificant attention in America, and undoubtedly influenced the exemptions passed in North Carolina and Maryland. Id. \\nIndeed, the importance of this exemption was \\ndemonstrated in debates over the Bill of Rights in \\nthe First Congress. Id., at 1472, n.320. In ridiculing \\nthe list of freedoms proposed to be protected, Theodore Sedgwick of Mass achusetts remarked \\u201cthey \\nmight have declared that a man should have a right to wear his hat if he pleased . . . but he would ask the \\ngentleman whether he thought it necessary to enter \\nthese trifles in a declaration of rights.\\u201d Id. (citation \\nomitted). With unmistakable reference to the Penn case, John Page of Virginia replied: \\nThe gentleman from \\nMassachusetts . . . objects to the clause, \\nbecause the right is of so trivial a \\nnature. He supposes it no more \\nessential than whether a man has a \\nright to wear his hat or not; but let me \\nobserve to him that such rights have \\nbeen opposed, and a man has been obliged to pull off his hat when he \\nappeared before the face of authority; \\npeople have also been prevented from \\n 18\\nassembling together on their lawful \\noccasions.  \\nId. (citation omitted). Certainly, the Founders were \\nacutely aware of the potential for abuse by \\nauthorities absent a robust religious liberty \\nprotection that clearly extended to actions, including \\nreligiously motivated expression or non-expression. \\n3. Taken together, the Free Exercise Clause and \\nthe Free Speech Clause elevate the freedom not to \\nspeak out of accordance with firmly held religious beliefs to the highest echelon of First Amendment \\nprotection. This conclusion is buttressed by the First \\nAmendment\\u2019s other guarantees\\u2014e.g., freedom of \\nassembly and freedom to petition the government. If \\nthe Free Exercise Clause conferred nothing more \\nthan a \\u201cright to express religious beliefs,\\u201d it would \\n\\u201cadd nothing to the First Amendment, since that right is fully protected by the right to assemble, \\nspeak, and publish.\\u201d Report to the Attorney General, \\nsupra note 2, at 19. Indeed, \\u201cbecause religious \\nexpression is doubly protected by the constitutional \\ntext\\u201d it would make little sense if it were \\u201cless \\nprotected in practice.\\u201d Id. , at 19, n.30. \\nThe examples cited above represent a clear \\nunderstanding by the Founding Generation that civil \\nlaws, even of general applicability, must yield when they conflict with religious expression or the freedom \\nto refrain from expression on the basis of a sincerely \\nheld religious belief. As it seems early legislative \\nbodies believed exemptions in such cases were \\nrequired by the principle of free exercise, it stands to \\nreason that the Framers understood \\u201csimilar \\napplications of the principle\\u201d would guide the courts \\n 19\\nin these cases, once \\u201centrusted with the \\nresponsibility of enforcing\\u201d First Amendment \\nguarantees. McConnell, Origins, at 1473. \\nAlthough there was a dearth of litigation over \\nreligious liberty protections in the early years of the \\nRepublic, what scarce examples exist support this \\nview. Consider, for example, the earliest state court \\nopinion addressing the issue of a religious liberty exemption, People v. Phillips . In that case, the court \\nheld that the New York Constitution protected a Catholic priest from compulsory testimony to \\nmatters learned while administering the Sacrament \\nof Confession. See  id., at 1504. \\nImportant to the Phillips court was the notion \\nthat requiring testimony from the priest to \\u201cwhat he \\nreceives in confession, is to declare that there shall \\nbe no penance; and this important branch of the Roman Catholic religion would be thus annihilated.\\u201d \\nId. (citation omitted). The court did not believe it was \\ncompatible with religious liberty to compel expression that would so eviscerate a core belief of Catholic faith. Rather than establishing a special \\nprivilege for adherents to the Catholic faith, though, \\nthe court viewed its actions as necessary to ensure \\nCatholics received the same  treatment as Protestants \\n(the dominant faith at the time) in the administration of their sacraments. Id., at 1504-05. \\nThe through line to the Founding Generation\\u2019s \\nunderstanding of religious liberty was a belief that \\nsuch freedom was without substantive meaning if it did not encompass expression, and non-expression, \\nrooted in religious belief. Noted Nineteenth Century \\n 20\\nConstitutional commentator, Michigan Supreme \\nCourt Justice Thomas Cooley, explained: \\nAn earnest believer usually regards it as his duty to propagate his opinions, \\nand to bring others to his views. To \\ndeprive him of this right is to take from \\nhim the power to perform what he \\nconsiders a most sacred obligation.  \\nT. Cooley, A Treatise on the Constitutional \\nLimitations 665 (7th ed. 1903). Put another way: \\nreligious freedom, as understood by the Founders, \\nnecessarily encompasses the freedom to put belief \\ninto action, to engage in expression consistent with \\nthe dogmas of your faith, and to refrain from \\nexpression that may engender extratemporal consequences. \\nII. T\\nHIS COURT \\u2019S PRECEDENTS \\u2014ESPECIALLY ITS \\nDEMANDING APPLICATION OF THE LEAST -\\nRESTRICTIVE MEANS TEST \\u2014DEMONSTRATE \\nAGREEMENT WITH THE FOUNDING GENERATION \\u2019S \\nROBUST RELIGIOUS LIBERTY PROTECTIONS . \\nThis Court has a commendable history of \\nrecognizing the principles discussed above. In \\nparticular, the Court\\u2019s recent religious liberty \\njurisprudence has been a welcome reprieve for \\nmembers of all faith communities who have been disheartened by the antagonism of some government \\nactors. See,  e.g., Espinoza v. Mont. Dept of Revenue , \\n140 S. Ct. 2246 (2020); Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. \\nColo. Civil Rights Comm\\u2019n , 138 S. Ct. 1719 (2018); \\nHosanna-Tabor , 565 U.S. 171. \\n 21\\nOf particular note is the Court\\u2019s insistence on a \\nforceful application of the strict scrutiny test to any \\nrestriction that burdens religious liberty. Indeed, \\u201cin \\nthis highly sensitive constitutional area, \\u2018only the \\ngravest abuses, endangering paramount interests, \\ngive occasion for permissible limitation.\\u2019\\u201d Sherbert v. \\nVerner , 374 U.S. 398, 406 (1963) (quoting Thomas v. \\nCollins, 323 U.S. 516, 530 (1945)). \\n1. A few examples illustrate the point. Consider \\nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. , where this \\nCourt considered a government-imposed contraceptive mandate on private employers who \\nbelieved such a requirement to be against their \\nreligious beliefs. 573 U.S. 682, 726 (2014).\\n4 While \\nassuming, without deciding, that the government\\u2019s \\ninterest was compelling, the Court nonetheless found \\nthat the least-restrictive-means standard was not \\nmet. Id., at 728. Identifying alternative solutions to \\nthe rigid mandate imposed by the government, the Court explained, \\u201c[t]he least-restrictive-means \\nstandard is exceptionally demanding.\\u201d Id.  As Justice \\nKennedy explained, religious freedom \\u201cimplicates more than just freedom of belief\\u201d; rather \\u201c[i]t means, too, the right to express those beliefs and to establish \\none\\u2019s religious (or nonreligious) self-definition in the \\npolitical, civic, and econ omic life of our larger \\n                                           \\n4 Hobby Lobby  was decided under the Religious Freedom \\nRestoration Act of 1993 (\\u201cRFRA\\u201d), which requires as an initial \\nmatter finding a substantial government burden on the exercise of religion; if such a burden exists, the Court must determine \\nwhether there is a compelling governmental interest and that \\nthe burden is the least restrictive means of furthering that \\ninterest. Hobby Lobby , 573 U.S., at 694-95. \\n 22\\ncommunity.\\u201d Id., at 736\\u201337 (Kennedy, J., \\nconcurring). \\nIn another instance, this Court found Missouri \\nviolated a church\\u2019s religious  liberty guarantees under \\nthe First Amendment when it categorically denied \\ntheir participation in a grant program for playground \\nsurface materials. Trinity Lutheran Church of \\nColumbia, Inc. v. Comer , 137 S. Ct. 2012, 2017, 2025 \\n(2017). Finding that otherwise eligible grant \\nrecipients were disqualified solely because of their \\nreligious nature, this Court held that such a penalty \\nworked against the free exercise of religion and \\u201ctriggers the most exacting scrutiny.\\u201d Id., at 2021. \\nImportantly, the harm was not the denial of the grant itself but instead was Missouri\\u2019s refusal to \\neven allow the church to compete with secular \\norganizations for grant funds solely on the basis of \\nits religious identity. Id., at 2022. \\nMore recently still, this Court took up the mantle \\nof religious liberties in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia . \\nDespite the Catholic Church\\u2019s over two centuries of dedication to serving the needy children of \\nPhiladelphia, the City in 2018 stopped referring foster children to the Catholic Social Services (\\u201cCSS\\u201d) \\nafter learning the organization would not \\u201cconsider \\nprospective foster parents in same-sex marriages.\\u201d \\nFulton , 141 S. Ct., at 1874\\u201375. Finding that \\u201cit is \\nplain\\u201d the City burdens CSS\\u2019s \\u201creligious exercise by putting it to the choice of  curtailing its mission or \\napproving relationships inconsistent with its beliefs,\\u201d this Court sought a review of whether such burden \\nwas \\u201cconstitutionally permissible.\\u201d Id., at 1876. In \\ndetermining that Philadelphia imposed an unconstitutional burden on CSS\\u2019s religious exercise, \\n 23\\nFulton  admonishes that \\u201cso lo ng as the government \\ncan achieve its interests in a manner that does not \\nburden religion, it must do so.\\u201d Id., at 1881. \\nTaken together, the precedents of this Court \\nestablish that an exacting analysis is required in \\nreligious liberty cases to determine whether the \\ngovernment\\u2019s interest is compelling, and its burden \\nnarrowly tailored to achieve that interest. The \\nexistence of an alternative means for achieving even \\na compelling interest is nearly always fatal to the government\\u2019s argument.  \\n2. When religious liberty and free expression \\nconcerns intertwine, this Court has been even less \\nhesitant to invalidate an infringing law. This \\nskepticism is warranted, as attempts to compel \\nexpression that conflicts with an individual\\u2019s \\nreligious beliefs are nothing more than indirect \\nattempts to regulate religion itself. \\nIn 1943, this Court took issue with a West \\nVirginia law mandating a flag salute and pledge, when its application was challenged by a group of \\nJehovah\\u2019s Witnesses who said such action violated \\ntheir religious beliefs. W. Va. State Bd. Of Educ. V. \\nBarnette , 319 U.S. 624 (1943). Refusing to find that \\n\\u201ca Bill of Rights which guards the individual\\u2019s right \\nto speak his own mind, left it open to public \\nauthorities to compel him to utter what is not on his \\nmind,\\u201d the Barnette  Court blocked the law\\u2019s \\nenforcement. Id. , at 634; see also  id., at 645 (Murphy, \\nJ., concurring) (recognizing \\u201c[t]he right of freedom of thought and of religion as guaranteed by the \\nConstitution against State action includes both the \\nright to speak freely and the right to refrain from \\n 24\\nspeaking at all\\u201d). Underlying the Court\\u2019s opinion was \\nthe belief that \\u201c[i]f there is any fixed star in our \\nconstitutional constellation, it is that no official, high \\nor petty, can prescribe what  shall be orthodox in \\npolitics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act \\ntheir faith therein.\\u201d Id., at 642. \\nExpanding on the holding in Barnette , the Court \\nin Wooley v. Maynard  considered a religious \\nobjection to display of the New Hampshire state motto\\u2014\\u201cLive Free or Die\\u201d\\u2014on the license plate of a \\ncar owned by Jehovah\\u2019s Witness. 430 U.S. 705 (1977). In Wooley , the Court expressly rejected the \\nidea that \\u201cthe State may constitutionally require an individual to participate in the dissemination of an \\nideological message by displaying it on his private \\nproperty.\\u201d Id., at 713. \\nFoundational to its decision was the Court\\u2019s \\nholding that the freedoms contained within the First \\nAmendment \\u201cincludes both the right to speak freely \\nand the right to refrain from speaking at all.\\u201d Id., at \\n714. It matters not whether most agree with the message the State seeks to force a person to convey; the First Amendment unquestionably \\u201cprotects the \\nright of individuals to hold a point of view different \\nfrom the majority and to refu se to foster . . . an idea \\nthey find morally objectionable.\\u201d Id. , at 715. Finding \\nthe existence of a governmental burden, the Court \\nwas left to question whether a substantial \\ngovernmental interest existed and, if so, whether the \\nburden was narrowly tailored to advance that \\ninterest. Even assuming a legitimate and substantial interest, the Court concluded \\u201cthat purpose cannot \\nbe pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental \\n 25\\npersonal liberties when the end can be more \\nnarrowly achieved.\\u201d Id., at 716. New Hampshire \\nfailed that test. \\nIn still another line of cases, this Court found \\nthat it violated Constitutional protections to subject religious observants, who went door to door \\ndistributing religious materials and soliciting for the \\npurchase of religious books, to a government \\nsolicitation registration requirement. Murdock v. \\nPennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105 (1943); see also Follett v. \\nTown of McCormick , 321 U.S. 573 (1944). \\nAcknowledging that the practice was derived from the believer\\u2019s understanding that he was \\u201cobeying a \\ncommandment of God,\\u201d the Court found that the First Amendment prohibited the imposition of a \\ngenerally applicable registration requirement to \\nengage in such conduct. Murdock , 319 U.S., at 108, \\n117. Indeed, the Court went out of its way to describe the literature being distributed as \\u201cprovocative, \\nabusive, and ill-mannered.\\u201d Id., at 115\\u201316. \\nNevertheless, \\u201c[p]lainly  a community may not \\nsuppress . . . the dissemination of views because they \\nare unpopular, annoying or distasteful.\\u201d Id.,  at 116 \\nTo allow otherwise would \\u201cbe a complete repudiation of the philosophy of the Bill of Rights.\\u201d Id. \\nThe Court went further still , establishing that the \\nmere fact the religious materials were being \\u201csold\\u201d was not enough to transform \\u201cevangelism into a \\ncommercial enterprise.\\u201d Id., at 111. As such, the \\nCourt acknowledged heightened constitutional protections for \\u201cthose spreading their religious \\nbeliefs through the spoken and printed word.\\u201d Id. As \\ncompared to purely commercial activity, \\u201c[f]reedom of \\n 26\\npress, freedom of speech, fr eedom of religion are in a \\npreferred position.\\u201d Id., at 115. \\nEven Employment Division v. Smith , often \\ncriticized as having watered down constitutional \\nreligious liberty protections, recognized the Court\\u2019s \\nunique hostility toward burdens that implicate both \\nthe free exercise of religion and the freedom of \\nspeech. The \\u201cFirst Amendment bars application of a \\nneutral, generally applicable law to religiously \\nmotivated action\\u201d when that action \\u201cinvolve[s] not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but the Free \\nExercise Clause in conjunction with other \\nconstitutional protections, such as freedom of \\nspeech.\\u201d Empl. Div. v. Smith , 494 U.S. 872, 881\\u201382 \\n(1990). Even some preceden ts, decided on free speech \\ngrounds alone, were undoubtedly reinforced by \\ntouches of freedom-of-religion concerns. Id. \\n3. This much is clear: the arc of this Court\\u2019s \\nprecedent bends in one incontrovertible direction. \\nScrutiny of any government burden is at its zenith \\nwhen the burden effects an individual\\u2019s exercise of their religious beliefs in a manner that implicates \\nfree speech protections. This conclusion, rooted in the \\nhistory and tradition of religious exercise as \\nunderstood by the Founders and enshrined in the \\nFirst Amendment, demands that any such burden be \\nsubjected to the most rigorous application of strict \\nscrutiny analysis. \\nIt is precisely for this reason that, to the best of \\nAmicus Curiae\\u2019s knowledge, the Court has never \\nissued an opinion finding that governmentally \\ncompelled religious speech satisfies strict scrutiny. \\nSee 303 Creative Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Elenis , 6 F.4th \\n 27\\n1160, 1191 (U.S. 10th Cir. 2021) (Tymkovich, C.J., \\ndissenting) (\\u201c[T]he majority takes the remarkable\\u2014\\nand novel\\u2014stance that the government may force \\nMs. Smith to produce messages that violate her \\nconscience. . . . No case has ever gone so far.\\u201d). \\nThis case should not be the first. \\nIII. THE TENTH CIRCUIT \\u2019S OPINION CANNOT BE \\nSQUARED EITHER WITH THE FIRST \\nAMENDMENT \\u2019S RICH HISTORY OR THIS COURT \\u2019S \\nPROTECTION OF BELIEVERS \\u2019 FREE SPEECH \\nRIGHTS . \\nIn its permissive application of strict scrutiny, the \\nTenth Circuit bastardized this Court\\u2019s protection of free speech rights, especially as applied to religious \\nexpression. If allowed to stand, its precedent will give license to courts across this Country to \\nhumiliate members of all religious sects by \\ncompelling them to speak in contravention of their \\nsincerely held religious beliefs. By purporting to \\napply strict scrutiny, the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s opinion \\ncheapened the First Amendment rights of Catholics, \\nProtestants, Muslims, Jews, and all other believers alike. \\nLuckily, this precedent d oes not need to stand. \\nThis Court, once again, has an opportunity to \\nadmonish that the free speech protections of \\nbelievers are no less than non-believers and, in fact, \\nare heightened when faced with government \\nregulation that would compel speech antithetical to the tenants of a believer\\u2019s faith. The First \\nAmendment commands such a result. \\n 28\\nAlthough the Tenth Circuit rightly concluded that \\nMs. Smith\\u2019s website designs are \\u201cpure speech,\\u201d 303 \\nCreative LLC, 6 F.4th, at 1176, the Tenth Circuit \\nwrongly concludes that the commercial nature of Ms. \\nSmith\\u2019s speech gives Colorado a regulatory hook to \\nlatch onto. Id., at 1179. By failing to acknowledge the \\nreligious nature of her objection to the would-be compelled speech, the Tenth Circuit did not afford \\nher First Amendment rights the \\u201cpreferred\\u201d status \\nthey deserve.\\n5 Cf., Murdock , 319 U.S., at 115. What \\nis remarkable is that the religious nature of Ms. Smith\\u2019s objection is not disputed. See 303 \\nCreative, 6 F. 4th, at 1172 (Ms. Smith is \\u201cwilling to create custom graphics and websites for gay, lesbian, \\nor bisexual clients . . . so long as the custom graphics \\nand websites do not violate [her] religious beliefs, as is true for all customers.\\u201d (internal quotation marks \\nomitted)); id., at 1192 (Tymkovich, C.J., dissenting) \\n(\\u201cIn short, Colorado appear s to agree that Ms. Smith \\ndoes not distinguish between customers based on \\nprotected-class status and thus advances the aims of \\nCADA. But when any customer asks Ms. Smith to \\ncreate expressive content that violates her sincerely \\nheld beliefs, she will decline the request.\\u201d). \\n                                           \\n5 Remarkably, the Tenth Circuit  suggests that its sweeping \\nholding may not apply to \\u201call artists\\u201d if they were not engaged \\nin \\u201ccommercial activity,\\u201d but rather \\u201ccommissioning a mural for some charitable purpose.\\u201d 303 Creative , 6 F.4th, at 1182, n.6. To \\nsuggest that a local artist wh o refuses to paint a Christian \\nmural for a church may enjoy more constitutional protections \\nthan a woman called to live out her sincerely held religious \\nbeliefs by creating custom wedding websites is, thankfully, not supported by the history or tradition of the First Amendment \\nand the muscular protections it affords religious believers. \\n 29\\nThis failure is compounded by the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s \\nfallacy of a marketplace of one for Ms. Smith\\u2019s \\nspeech. Id. at 1180. Such convenient analysis \\nallowed the court to conclude \\u201cthere are no less intrusive means of providing equal access to those  \\ntypes of services.\\u201d Id. (emphasis added). But this \\nclever reasoning flips this Court\\u2019s precedent on its \\nhead. Rather than prioritize the religious speaker\\u2019s \\nobjection in search of a less restrictive means, the \\ncourt below merely concluded that she is the only one and therefore no other means will suffice. But, \\nwhere, as here, the government can achieve its interests without burdening religion, the \\nConstitution requires it to do so. Fulton , 141 S. Ct., \\nat 1881. The analysis is also anomalous in the free speech context because it cannot be that the more \\nunique and distinctive the speech, the less  First \\nAmendment protection it deserves. But that is the staggering breadth of the Tenth Circuit majority\\u2019s \\nconclusion. See 303 Creative , 6 F.4th, at 1204-05 \\n(Tymkovich, C.J., dissenting).  \\nMoreover, by categorizing Ms. Smith as nothing \\nmore than a \\u201cpublic accommodation,\\u201d the Tenth \\nCircuit minimized her right to participate in the \\nmarketplace, even as a woman of faith. See 303 \\nCreative, 6 F.4th, at 1181 (\\u201c[W]hether an exception limits market access depends upon the uniqueness of \\nthe public accommodation\\u2019s goods and services\\u2014not \\nthe sincerity of the public accommodation\\u2019s beliefs.\\u201d). \\nTo deny a benefit to those \\u201cwho engage in certain \\nforms of speech is in effect to penalize them for such \\nspeech,\\u201d and constitutionally, no different than \\nconditioning a benefit on a person\\u2019s \\u201cwillingness to \\nviolate a cardinal principle of her religious faith;\\u201d the \\n 30\\nresult is the same: to \\u201cdeter[] or discourage[] the \\nexercise of First Amendment rights of expression.\\u201d \\nSherbert , 374 U.S., at 405-06 (citing Speiser v. \\nRandall, 357 U.S. 513, 518 (1958)). Here too, Colorado seeks to impose the same constitutional \\nharm: speak in violation of your core religious faith \\nor lose the benefit of marketplace participation. Put \\nsimply, Colorado seeks to punish Ms. Smith for her \\nsincerely held religious beliefs. See also Trinity \\nLutheran Church , 137 S. Ct., at 2021\\u201322 (finding a \\nconstitutional violation where a burden puts \\nreligious believers \\u201cto a choice: [] participate in an \\notherwise available benefit\\u201d or maintain your \\nreligious identity). \\nThe same fundamental principle must apply to \\nfree speech and religious practices when they act in concert: \\u201cIn an open, pluralistic, self-governing \\nsociety, the expression of an idea cannot be \\nsuppressed simply because some find it offensive, \\ninsulting, or even wounding.\\u201d Fulton , 141 S. Ct., at \\n1924-25 (Alito, J., concurring). To lose this principle is to lose the \\u201cpreservation of religious freedom.\\u201d Id., \\nat 1925. That is because \\u201c[s]uppressing speech\\u2014or \\nreligious practice\\u2014simply because it expresses an idea that some find hurtful is a zero-sum game.\\u201d Id. \\nThis Court\\u2019s jurisprudence confirms this link \\nbetween religious exercise and free speech because \\nthis Court\\u2019s opinions \\u201cmake it perfectly clear that \\ndiscrimination against religious, as opposed to \\nsecular, expression is viewpoint discrimination.\\u201d \\nNurre v. Whitehead , 559 U.S. 1025, 1028 (2010) \\n(Alito, J., dissenting). And because viewpoint discrimination is \\u201can egregious form of content \\ndiscrimination,\\u201d Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of \\n 31\\nthe Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995), it brings \\nwith it heightened constitutional skepticism. \\nAlthough some may find Ms. Smith\\u2019s religious \\nbeliefs objectionable, \\u201creligions, and those who \\nadhere to religious doctrines, may continue to \\nadvocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by \\ndivine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be \\ncondoned.\\u201d Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U.S. 644, 679 \\n(2015). \\u201cAn open society can keep that promise while still respecting the \\u2018dignity,\\u2019 \\u2018worth,\\u2019 and fundamental equality of all members of the \\ncommunity.\\u201d Fulton , 141 S. Ct., at 1925 (Alito, J., \\nconcurring) (quoting Masterpiece Cakeshop , 138 S. \\nCt., at 1727). Ms. Smith should be free to practice all \\naspects of her faith, without fear of government-\\ncompelled expression against her sincerely held \\nreligious beliefs. The Constitution demands no less. \\nCONCLUSION \\n \\n\\u201c[T]here is before us the right of freedom to \\nbelieve, freedom to worship one\\u2019s Maker according to the dictates of one\\u2019s conscience, a right which the \\nConstitution specifically shelters.\\u201d Barnette , 319 \\nU.S., at 645 (Murphy, J., concurring). For this Court, there is \\u201cno loftier duty or responsibility than to \\nuphold that spiritual freedom to its farthest \\nreaches.\\u201d Id. \\nTo exclude Ms. Smith from offering her services\\u2014\\nsolely on the basis of her religious identity\\u2014would be \\n\\u201codious to our Constitution.\\u201d Trinity Lutheran \\nChurch , 137 S.

As part of that project, EPA has obtained emails and handwritten and typewritten notes under public records requests, which records on their face confess to the driving factor behind this liti-gation and similar litigation and inform the inquiry into federal versus state jurisdiction in this booming class of \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation filed in state courts. These records EPA obtained prompted it to file its first amicus  brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for \\nthe First Circuit, where removal of another among the growing number of \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d lawsuits filed \\nby governmental entities seeking billions of dollars \\nfrom private parties is pending.\\n2 That brief revealed \\ntwo sets of notes each purporting, independently, to record the assertion by an official with the governmen-tal plaintiff in that case, the State of Rhode Island, that the litigation seeks to obtain a \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d to underwrite that State\\u2019s spending ambitions, \\n \\n 1 Pursuant to Rule 37.6, counsel for Amicus  certifies that no \\ncounsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in part and that no person or entity other than Amici  or their counsel made a \\nmonetary contribution intended to fund the brief \\u2019s preparation or submission. All parties\\u2019 counsel of record received notice regarding \\nthe filing of this brief on April 27,  2020. This brief is filed by con-\\nsent of all parties. Petitioners fil ed a blanket consent for all such \\nbriefs on April 13, 2020. Respondent provided its written consent via email on April 29, 2020. \\n \\n2 See State of Rhode Island v. Shell Oil Products Co., LLC, et \\nal., Case No. 19-1818 (1st Cir.). Leave for EPA to file as amicus \\ncuriae  granted on March 26, 2020 \\n2 \\n after the State\\u2019s legislature declined to provide the de-\\nsired funds. Rhode Island\\u2019s confession was made at a meeting attended by \\u201ccabinet\\u201d-level representatives of numerous state governments from across the nation, including a representative from Maryland, and empha-sized the desire to pr oceed in state courts.\\n3 In that First \\nCircuit litigation, numerous  parties rely upon the \\nFourth Circuit\\u2019s decision in  the instant matter, and par-\\nties to the First Circuit litigation ad dressed the Fourth \\nCircuit\\u2019s opinion below in let ters of supplemental au-\\nthority pursuant to Fed. R. Ap p. Pro. 28(j). Because EPA \\nhas obtained records confe ssing the rationale behind \\nthe veritable tsunami of state-court \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d lawsuits such as the one now before this Court, and af-firming the plaintiffs\\u2019 emp hasis among peers and other \\npotential governmental plaint iff-recruits on using state \\ncourts for these actions with  national p olicy implica-\\ntions and avoiding the federal court system, EPA is keenly interested in this case and asks this Court to \\ngrant certiorari to address th e proper relationship be-\\ntween the state and federal court systems. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\n As important as climate policy is to both state and \\nfederal governments, equally and arguably more im-portant is the principle that the courts\\u2019 role is not to \\nmake policy judgments. This Court held in American \\nElectric Power v. Connecticut , 131 S. Ct. 2527, 2539, \\n \\n 3 A full list of attendees prepared by the organizers and ob-\\ntained under Colorado law is ava ilable at https://govoversight.org/ \\nwp-content/uploads/2020/01/Fulsome-list-of-participants.png. \\n3 \\n 564 U.S. 410, 426 (2011) that \\u201cthe federal courts would \\nhave no warrant to employ the federal common law of nuisance to upset\\u201d federal primacy in climate regula-tory policy. But rather than heed the American Electric \\nPower  opinion\\u2019s warnings that federal policy decisions \\nare to be made by Congress or by federal agencies ex-ercising properly delegated authority, certain litigants have instead attempted to end run that holding by seeking to create policy in state, rather than federal, courts. While federal courts ar e courts of limited juris-\\ndiction, in this matter the de cision below is based upon \\na series of cases that have eviscerated the jurisdiction of federal courts, even when important federal inter-ests are at stake. This is in conflict with the decisions of other Circuits, congressional action taken since these \\nFourth Circuit precedents were  adopted, and this Court\\u2019s \\nown rulings. Allowing the opin ion below to stand will \\ncause mischief in state courts across the nation. Re-cently obtained public records provide strong impetus to acknowledge, as a formal matter, that this \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation campaign is an impermissible use of the state courts, just as this Court previously held it \\nwas an impermissible use of the federal courts. This Court should prevent litigants from seeking the most favorable forum to obtain p olitical and policy ends by \\njudicial means. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\n  \\n4 \\n ARGUMENT \\nI. THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\\u2019S DECISION CON-\\nTRADICTS RECENT JURISPRUDENCE \\nAND LEGISLATION. THIS COURT SHOULD \\nGRANT CERTIORARI TO ENFORCE ITS OWN PRECEDENTS AND CONGRESSIONAL INTENT \\n The decision below, designated for publication and \\nwith the potential to shape or confuse the law for years \\nto come, is based on a series of precedents unique to the Fourth Circuit, many of which contradict more re-\\ncent holdings of this Court and even statutory changes \\nenacted by Congress. The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s reliance on its own, idiosyncratic precedents led to a result that is \\nin conflict with the holdings  of numerous other courts \\nand which will, if allowed to stand, result in mischief across the nation. \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision below, while pub-\\nlished only this year, has its foundations in a holding \\nfrom the 1970s that has been  adrift in changing legal \\nseas since then, and was implicitly swamped by a hold-ing of this Court twenty years ago. That Fourth Circuit \\nopinion, Noel v. McCain , 538 F.2d 633 (4th Cir. 1976), \\nheld that remand orders are essentially unreviewable unless they raise very narrow statutory grounds. Stare \\ndecisis  is an important legal principle, but in this case \\nthe Fourth Circuit\\u2019s adherence to its own precedents rather than those of this Court was misplaced. \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision below acknowledges \\nthat this Court subsequently interpreted the same \\n5 \\n statutory language differently in Yamaha Motor Corp., \\nU.S.A. v. Calhoun , 516 U.S. 199 (1996). More recently, \\nthe Seventh Circuit reached a contrary conclusion \\nabout the reviewability of di strict court orders to re-\\nmand in Lu Junhong v. Boeing Co. , 792 F.3d 805, 810\\u2013\\n13 (7th Cir. 2015). Even assuming, arguendo , that the \\nFourth Circuit properly decided the Noel  case in 1976, \\ncontinued reliance on Noel  is no longer appropriate. \\n It isn\\u2019t just precedent t hat has changed since the \\nFourth Circuit issued its opinion in Noel . Relevant \\nstatutory law has also changed: the Removal Clarifica-\\ntion Act of 2011, Pub. L. No. 112-51, 125 Stat. 545, clar-ified Congressional intent for federal courts to \\u201cclarify \\nand improve certain provisions relating to the removal \\nof litigation against Federal officers or agencies to Fed-\\neral courts.\\u201d \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision below (hereinafter \\n\\u201cBaltimore \\u201d), is based on foundations that Congress, \\nother federal courts, and this Court have steadily \\neroded since the Fourth Circu it issued the authority on \\nwhich Baltimore  rests. This Court, the Seventh Circuit, \\nand Congress itself have all spoken more recently. The \\ninnovative legal theories brought by the Plaintiffs in this case further highlight the need to decide the mat-\\nter based on current law. This Court should take the \\nopportunity to apply the Removal Clarification Act and resolve the split in the circuits that the Baltimore  opin-\\nion below aggravates. \\n \\n6 \\n II. IF THE DECISION BELOW STANDS, FED-\\nERAL COURTS WILL BE UNABLE TO PRE-\\nVENT FEDERAL POLICIES FROM BEING UNDERMINED AT THE STATE LEVEL \\n This suit is but one of many similar suits being \\nfiled all over the country. More than a dozen U.S. cit-\\nies, states and counties including the State of Rhode Island, City and County of Boulder (CO), City and \\nCounty of Honolulu (HI), City of New York (NY), \\nMarin, San Mateo and Santa Cruz Counties (CA), the cities of Imperial Beach, Oakland, Richmond, San \\nFrancisco, San Mateo, and Santa Cruz (CA), and King \\nCounty (WA), among others have filed similar claims against similar and generally the same defendants al-\\nleging similar causes of action which allegedly arise \\nunder state law. As at least one court has previously noted, multi-front litigation raises important concerns \\nabout the motivations of litigants. Chevron Corp. v. \\nDonziger , 974 F.Supp.2d 362, 475 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (\\u201cThe \\npoint of the multi-front strategy thus was to leverage \\nthe expense, risks, and bu rden to [defendant] of de-\\nfending itself in multiple jurisdictions to achieve a swift recovery, most likely by precipitating a settle-\\nment.\\u201d), later upheld at Chevron Corp. v. Donziger , 833 \\nF.3d 74 (2d Cir. 2016), cert. denied  at 137 S. Ct. 2268 \\n(2017). \\n This explosion in such cases filed in state court \\nseeks many hundreds of billions of dollars from private \\nparties, and seeks to enlist the defendants as advo-\\ncates in pressing for the plai ntiffs\\u2019 and their partners\\u2019 \\ndesired federal policies. Records obtained by Amicus  \\n7 \\n also show the attempt to us e the litigation to obtain \\ngovernmental revenues after that failed through the \\nappropriate, political process (see, infra ). Affirming the \\nimpropriety of this use of the courts as well as the ar-dent campaign by state and municipal plaintiffs to \\nkeep the matters away from the federal court and ex-\\nclusively before state courts, EPA has obtained emails and handwritten and typewritten notes under public \\nrecords requests, further discussed below, that illus-\\ntrate the danger of allowing st ate courts to interfere in \\nthis way in lawful interstate commerce conducted un-\\nder the auspices of the federal government. Key among \\nthese public records are two sets of notes each purport-ing, independently, to record the assertion by a senior \\nState of Rhode Island official that the objective of its \\nlitigation was to obtain a \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d for the State\\u2019s spending ambitions, in the face of a leg-\\nislature that does not share the executive\\u2019s priorities. \\n Both sets of notes record that official as emphasiz-\\ning the use of state courts to  obtain this funding denied \\nthem by the legislature. Other records, also noted, in-\\nfra, record the plaintiff \\u2019s legal counsel\\u2019s team, at least \\nsome of whom also represent the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore in this litigation,\\n4 lobbying gov-\\nernmental officials to join the campaign emphasizing the strategy of advancing this cause in the \\u201cmore ad-vantageous venue for these cases,\\u201d which plaintiffs confess is to be had in state courts. \\n \\n 4 The California law firm Sher Edling LLP represents both \\nthe State of Rhode Island in the First Circuit and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore in the Fourth Circuit. \\n8 \\n  These public records obtained through state open \\nrecords laws by Amicus  EPA represent a Rhode Island \\n\\u201ccabinet\\u201d-level official confiding to peers that the \\nState\\u2019s elected representatives are insufficiently moved by the plaintiff \\u2019s requests to enact laws raising \\nthe revenues the State\\u2019s executive desires; and that it \\nis thus \\u201clooking for [a] sustainable funding stream,\\u201d having been reduced to \\u201csuing big oil\\u201d for its \\u201cPriority \\n\\u2013 sustainable funding stream .\\u201d Notably, both sets of \\nnotes capture the State of Rhode Island as having em-phasized the \\u201cstate court\\u201d aspect of its plan. \\n These records, representing a similarly-situated \\nplaintiff \\u2019s confession, as recorded identically by two by \\nothers in the comfort of a presumably candid and off-\\nthe-record private meeting with peers and funders of \\u201cclimate\\u201d activism, leave little doubt that this growing \\nwave of state court \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation seeks \\nat least two impermissible objectives. First, this type of litigation seeks to use (state) courts to effectively \\ncreate federal energy and environmental policy. Sec-\\nond, in addition to using litigation as a stand-in for \\nthe political process that has denied state and munic-\\nipal plaintiffs their desired policies, it seeks to use lit-\\nigation to raise revenues having be en denied them \\nwhere revenues would properly be raised, which \\nagain is by the po litical process. \\n These public records provide strong impetus to \\nacknowledge, as a formal matter, that this \\u201cclimate \\nnuisance\\u201d litigation campaign is an impermissible use of the courts, seeking the most favorable forum to ob-\\ntain political ends by judicial means; that when filed \\n9 \\n they must remain in federal court; and that they \\nshould be dismissed for the same reasons. \\n \\nIII. PUBLIC RECORDS OBTAINED BY PRO-\\nPOSED AMICUS CURIAE  AFFIRM THIS \\nCASE BELONGS IN FEDERAL COURT \\n Amicus  EPA has obtained public records from Col-\\norado State University\\u2019s Center for a New Energy Economy (\\u201cCNEE\\u201d) under the Colorado Open Records \\nAct (\\u201cCORA\\u201d). Those records have now been brought to \\nthe attention of the First Circuit in related litigation, and are proper subject for judic ial notice by this Court. \\nSee Fed. Rule Evid. 201(b)(2). The records pertain to a \\ntwo-day meeting in July 2019 hosted by the Rockefel-ler Brothers Fund (\\u201cRBF\\u201d) at the Rockefeller family \\nmansion at Pocantico, NY. They include numerous \\nemails, agendas and other materials. Most pertinent, they also include a set of handwritten notes and a sec-\\nond, corroborating set of typewritten notes. According \\nto the public records themselves, the former was pre-pared by attendee Carla Frisch of the Rocky Mountain \\nInstitute (\\u201cRMI\\u201d), and the latter by attendee Katie \\nMcCormack of the Energy Foundation.\\n5 \\n \\n 5 These are available, respectively, at https://climatelitigationwatch. \\norg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Carla-Frisch-handwritten-notes- EPA_CORA1505.pdf and https:// climatelitigationwatch.org/ \\nwp-content/uploads/2020/03/EF-Katie-McCormack-typed-notes-EPA_CORA1542.pdf. These documents are identified in an August \\n20, 2019 email from CNEE\\u2019s Patric k Cummins transmitting them \\nto RBF\\u2019s Michael Northrop, Subject: meeting highlights, available at https://climatelitigationwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ \\n \\n10 \\n  This was a private event, styled \\u201cAccelerating \\nState Action on Climate Change,\\u201d if hosted as a forum \\nfor policy activists and a major funder to coordinate \\nwith senior public employees, e.g., a governor\\u2019s chief of staff and department secretaries and their cabinet \\nequivalents from fifteen states. These states included \\nFirst Circuit Plaintiff the State of Rhode Island, repre-sented by its Director of the Department of Environ-\\nmental Management, Janet Coit.\\n6 \\n These notes purport to contemporaneously record \\nthe comments of Director Coit discussing Rhode Is-\\nland\\u2019s entry in this litigation campaign, among peers. One passage in each set of no tes, attributed to Director \\nCoit and replicated almost verbatim in both, is partic-\\nularly striking and relevant, affirming two points that have become obvious and which should inform key de-\\ncisions confronting the judiciary in this \\u201cclimate nui-\\nsance\\u201d litigation campaign. \\n The records show RMI\\u2019s Frisch recorded Director \\nCoit speaking to this litigation as shown in the below \\n \\nEdited-notes-transmittal-email-CSU-suggests-Snail-mail-probably- \\ncovered-EPA_CORA1481_Redacted.pdf. \\u201cRBF CNEE climate pol-icy notes Jul 17 18.docx\\u201d are Katie McCormack\\u2019s notes (Energy Foundation); these appear to be produced as document EPA_ CORA1542.pdf, derived from Ms. McCormick\\u2019s transmittal email \\nbeing 1541, in which she describes her notes as long, and 1542 consists of 18 pages of notes;  \\u201cXerox Scan_07222019155622.pdf \\u201d \\nare Carla Frisch\\u2019s handwritten notes (this was produced as docu-ment EPA_CORA1505.pdf ). \\n \\n6 The participant list is availabl e at https://climatelitigation-\\nwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/List-of-Attendees-EPA_ CORA1037.pdf. \\n11 \\n excerpted image (Ms. Frisch\\u2019s notes are available in \\nfull at https://climatelitigationwatch.org/wp-content/ \\nuploads/2020/03/Carla-Frisch-handwritten-notes-EPA_ \\nCORA1505.pdf ). Ms. Frisch recorded Director Coit as saying, about this suit: \\nRI \\u2013 Gen Assembly D but doesn\\u2019t care on env/climate \\nlooking for sustainable funding stream \\nsuing big oil for RI damages in state court \\n \\n The first line-item attributes to Director Coit the \\nposition that the Rhode Island legislature is not per-suaded of the claims set fort h by the State in its litiga-\\ntion. This reluctance to politically impose the revenue-\\nraising measures (taxes) necessary for such funding streams is inherently shared among all \\u201cclimate nui-\\nsance\\u201d plaintiffs. The excerp t appears to also reflect \\nDirector Coit\\u2019s view of why the Rhode Island legisla-ture has thereby declined to obtain from the taxpayer, \\n\\n12 \\n and then appropriate to the State, the revenue streams \\nthat governmental Plaintiff Rhode Island desires. \\n This entry on its face represents a senior official \\nconfessing that Rhode Island\\u2019s climate litigation, es-\\nsentially identical to that in the Baltimore case below, \\nis in fact a product of Rhode Island\\u2019s elected represent-atives lacking enthusiasm for politically enacting cer-\\ntain policies, including reve nue measures, thus leaving \\nthe state \\u201clooking for [a] sustainable funding stream,\\u201d and so \\u201csuing big oil.\\u201d This characterizes all such gov-\\nernmental plaintiffs and su its including the matter \\nin the Fourth Circuit case which is the subject of the \\nPetition in this matter. \\n Fortunately, we can be confident that Ms. Frisch \\ndid not mishear Director Coit. The Energy Foundation\\u2019s \\nKatie McCormack provided RBF with a typewritten \\nset of her own notes transcribing the proceedings. To this Court\\u2019s further benefit, Ms. McCormack\\u2019s type-\\nwritten transcription of Director Coit\\u2019s commentary \\nreads almost verbatim as Ms. Frisch\\u2019s. \\n Ms. McCormack recorded Di rector Coit as saying: \\n* Assembly very conservative leadership \\u2013 don\\u2019t \\ncare about env\\u2019t \\n* If care, put it in the budget \\n* Priority \\u2013 sustainable funding stream * State court against oil/gas \\n13 \\n  \\n These notes on their face both affirm two realities \\nthat have become inescapable in recent years about this epidemic of \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation, all chan-neled into state courts (aft er the first generation of \\nsuits floundered in federal co urt, and ultimately were \\nterminated by this Court in American Electric Power v. \\nConnecticut , 131 S. Ct. 2527, 2539, 564 U.S. 410, 426 \\n(2011)).\\n7 That is that these suits seek to use the courts \\nto stand in for policymakers on two fronts. First, these suits ask the courts to substitute their authority for that of the political branches of government on matters of policy. Second, these suits seek billions of dollars in revenues, again the province of the political branches, for distribution toward political uses and constituen-cies. \\n O n  t h a t  fi r s t  c o u n t  o f  policymaking through the \\ncourts, the RBF meeting notes ratify a comment made to The Nation magazine by the plaintiffs\\u2019 tort lawyer credited with inventing this wave of litigation, Matt \\n \\n 7 See, e.g., Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp ., \\n663 F.Supp.2d 863 (N.D. Cal. 2009), upheld at  696 F.3d 849 (9th \\nCir. 2012). \\n\\n14 \\n Pawa. The magazine wrote, \\u201cAt the end of his speech, \\nSenator [Sheldon] Whitehouse [of Rhode Island] re-minded his colleagues of their \\u2018legislative responsibil-ity to address climate change.\\u2019 But it\\u2019s clear that too many lawmakers have abdicated, thus the pressure to tackle the climate issue thro ugh existing regulations \\nlike the Clean Air Act, and through the courts. \\u2018I\\u2019ve been hearing for twelve years or more that legislation is right around the corner that\\u2019s going to solve the global-warming problem, and that litigation is too long, difficult, and arduous a path,\\u2019 said Matthew Pawa, a climate attorney. \\u2018Legislation is going nowhere, so liti-gation could potentially play an important role.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n8 \\n Such use of the courts is of course improper but \\nalso informs a conclusion that these cases, when \\nbrought, belong in federal cour t, as well as that they \\nshould be dismissed for reasons including the inher-\\nently obvious, and now repeatedly confessed, purpose. \\n The second conclusion affirmed by these twice-\\nsourced assertions by the First Circuit plaintiffs is that \\nthis type of litigation is a grab for revenues, which again must properly be purs ued through the political \\nprocess. This is related to the first, in that, like policy, \\nsuch revenue-raising measures must be enacted by the voters\\u2019 elected representatives or approved directly by \\nvoters. Instead, with the desire for more \\u201cfunding \\nstreams\\u201d being yet another way the political process \\n \\n 8 Zoe Carpenter, The Government May Already Have the \\nLaw It Needs to Beat Big Oil , The Nation (July 15, 2015), \\nhttps://www.thenation.com/article/the-government-may-already-have-the-law-it-needs-to-beat-big-oil/. \\n15 \\n has failed such plaintiffs, we see them circumventing \\nthat process through this litigation campaign. \\n That the desire for more governmental revenue, \\nwithout adopting the necessa ry direct taxes for which \\nthere can be a political price to pay, was behind such \\nlitigation was suggested by the U.S. Chamber of Com-merce in a 2019 report enti tled \\u201cMitigating Munici-\\npality Litigation: Scope and Solutions,\\u201d published by \\nthe Chamber\\u2019s Institute fo r Legal Reform. That re-\\nport highlighted: \\n* \\u201cFor instance, local government leaders may \\neye the prospect of significant recoveries as a \\nmeans of making up for budget shortfalls.\\u201d \\n* \\u201cLarge settlements like those produced in the \\ntobacco litigation are alluring to municipali-\\nties facing budget constraints.\\u201d \\n* \\u201cSevere, persistent municipal budget con-\\nstraints have coincided with the rise of munic-ipal litigation agains t opioid manufacturers \\nas local governments are promised large re-\\ncoveries with no risk to municipal budgets by contingency fee trial lawyers.\\u201d \\n* \\u201cConclusion  A convergence of factors is propelling munici-\\npalities to file affirmative lawsuits against corporate entities. \\n There is the \\u2018push\\u2019 factor: municipalities face \\nhistoric budgetary cons traints and a public \\ninundated with news reports on the opioid cri-\\nsis, rising sea levels, and data breaches. And \\n16 \\n there is the \\u2018pull\\u2019 of potential multimillion-\\ndollar settlements and low-cost, contingency \\nfee trial lawyers. As a consequence, munici-\\npalities are pivoting to the courts by the thou-\\nsands.\\u201d9 \\n The National Association of Manufacturers\\u2019 Cen-\\nter for Legal Action has similarly argued that, \\u201cThe \\ntowns and lawyers have said that this litigation is \\nsolely about money. The towns want funding for local projects, and their lawyers are working on a contin-\\ngency fee basis, which means they aren\\u2019t paid if they \\ndon\\u2019t win.\\u201d\\n10 \\n The records EPA has obtained now provide docu-\\nmentary evidence to support these concerns that the courts are being exploited to balance municipal/state \\nbudgets and make policy decisions that legislators \\nhave declined to make. \\n \\n  \\n \\n 9 United States Chamber of Co mmerce, \\u201cMitigating Munici-\\npality Litigation: Scope and Solutions,\\u201d U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, March 2019, h ttps://www.instituteforlegalre-\\nform.com/uploads/sites/1/Mitigating-Municipality-Litigation-2019- Research.pdf, at p. 1, 6, 7 and 18, respectively. \\n \\n10 Manufacturers\\u2019 Accountability Project, \\u201cBeyond the Court-\\nroom: Climate Liability Litigation in the United States,\\u201d p. 2, https://mfgaccountabilityproject.or g/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ \\nMAP-Beyond-the-Courtroom-Chapter-One.pdf \\n17 \\n IV. HISTORIC CONCERNS ABOUT STATE \\nCOURT BIAS ARE AMPLIFIED IN CASES \\nOF THIS TYPE, SUCH THAT FEDERAL \\nCOURTS SHOULD STEP IN TO PROTECT \\nFEDERAL INTERESTS \\n A \\u201chistoric concern about state court bias\\u201d is the \\nunderlying basis allowing for federal officer removal. \\nSavoie v. Huntington Ingalls, Inc. , 817 F.3d 457, 461 \\n(5th Cir. 2016). The Supreme Court also recognizes bias as a concern justifying removal to federal court. \\n\\u201cState-court proceedings may reflect \\u2018local prejudice\\u2019 \\nagainst unpopular federal laws or federal officials.\\u201d Watson v. Philip Morris Cos. , 551 U.S. 142, 150 (2007). \\nBias exists, as these opinions acknowledge, and there \\nis no rational basis for declaring that such bias extends only to parties who are unpopular government offi-\\ncials. Indeed, this Court has  cautioned against \\u201cnarrow, \\ngrudging interpretation\\u201d of federal officer removal. Willingham v. Morgan , 395 U.S. 402, 407 (1969). \\nSimply put, \\u201c[t]he removal statute is an incident of fed-\\neral supremacy.\\u201d Murray v. Murray , 621 F.2d 103, 106 \\n(5th Cir. 1980). \\n States and municipalities are engaged in a cam-\\npaign through the courts to overturn \\u201cunpopular fed-\\neral laws.\\u201d Rather than recognizing the Constitution \\nand federal laws as supreme, governmental \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d plaintiffs are applying \\u201cnarrow, grudging\\u201d \\ninterpretation of the removal statute to seek to over-\\nturn federal law through imposing ostensible tort lia-bility in state courts. \\n18 \\n  It is hard to imagine a more striking case where \\nfear of state court bias could be a concern than is pre-\\nsented in the instant matter and similar cases unfold-\\ning across the nation. Stated otherwise and even more affirmatively, the hope  for state court bias is demon-\\nstrably at play in these case s, as shown in other records \\nobtained by Amicus  EPA through public records laws. \\n As documented, supra , by its own admission the \\nState of Rhode Island is pursuing its litigation to ob-tain a \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d for its officials\\u2019 \\nspending ambitions, having failed to convince the vot-\\ners\\u2019 elected representatives to provide one. Rhode Is-land\\u2019s circumstance in this respect differs not at all \\nfrom all such plaintiffs including in Baltimore . Both \\nsets of notes discussed, supra , specify Director Coit\\u2019s \\nemphasis on seeking this \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d \\nin \\u201cstate court.\\u201d All such plaintiffs are now moving \\nHeaven and earth to keep these matters out of the clutches of federal jurisdiction. \\n This objective of suing to make federal policy in \\nstate courts is a thematic cousin of the drive to use the \\ncourts when legislatures fail to enact plaintiffs\\u2019 desired \\npolicies, and is well-understood among the instant plaintiffs, Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, and by \\nthe legal teams for most similarly-situated govern-\\nment plaintiffs. That Rhode Island and the City of Bal-timore share not only claims and legal strategies but \\nlegal counsel, whose recruit ing team has emphasized \\nto targeted governmental entities the desire to keep these matters in state court as the \\u201cmore advantageous \\nvenue for these cases,\\u201d given this Court\\u2019s ruling in \\n19 \\n American Electric Power , raises concerns that the cli-\\nmate nuisance plaintiffs also  share the hope for state \\ncourt biases in the campaign to eliminate budgetary \\nshortfalls and otherwise make policy through tort liti-gation. \\n For example, and again turning to documents ob-\\ntained through open records laws, we see that, after \\nU.S. District Judge William Alsup dismissed the City \\nof Oakland\\u2019s \\u201cclimate nuisanc e\\u201d suit against many of \\nthe same defendants in June 2018,\\n11 a lobbyist hired to \\nassist with recruiting more governmental plaintiffs for \\nSher Edling12 passed along a note of encouragement to \\n \\n 11 City of Oakland, et al. v.

G. Seth \\nPlatt is one of the network\\u2019s cons ultants, engaged to help lobby \\nFlorida municipalities to file suit similar to the State\\u2019s.

(\\u201cLDF\\u201d) has strived to secure \\nthe constitutional promise of equality for all people. Petitioner asks the Court to reconsider an important question about the Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s reach, which, more than any other constitutional provision, \\nembodies our Nation\\u2019s commitment to equal justice \\nunder the law.  \\nLDF has been at the forefront of efforts to enforce \\nthe Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s promise of equality. See, e.g. , Cooper v. Aaron , 358 U.S. 1 (1958);\\n Brown v. \\nBd. of Educ. of Topeka , 347 U.S. 483 (1954) . LDF has \\nalso led the fight of eradicating discrimination from jury verdicts. See, e.g. , Ham v. South Carolina , 409 \\nU.S. 524 (1973)\\n; Alexander v. Louisiana , 405 U.S. 625 \\n(1972) ; Swain v. Alabama , 380 U.S. 202 (1965). \\nLDF submits this brief to aid the Court in \\ndeciding whether the Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s Due Process Clause incorporates the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement against the States.\\n1  \\n  \\n                                                \\n1 Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.6, counsel for amicus \\ncuriae state that no counsel for a party authored this brief in \\nwhole or in part and that no person other than amicus curiae , its \\nmembers, or its counsel made a monetary contribution to the preparation or submission of this brief. All parties have consented to the filing of this brief. \\n2 \\n \\n SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \\nAfter the Civil War, Congress passed the \\nFourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of \\n1875 to protect the rights of newly freed African \\nAmericans. One of the rights protected by those provisions was the right to  serve on a jury. Indeed, \\nthis Court affirmed the centrality of jury service to the citizenship of African Americans 140 years ago. See \\nStrauder v. West Virginia , 100 U.S. 303 (1879). \\nThen, in 1898, white Louisianans convened a \\nconstitutional convention. Their goal was to craft a constitution that would \\u201cestablish the supremacy of \\nthe white race . . . to the extent to which it could be \\nlegally and constitutionally done . . . .\\u201d Louisiana \\nratified its non-unanimous jury provision at this convention to help achieve its goal of cementing white supremacy. While federal law made it illegal to exclude Black people from jury service, the delegates \\npassed the non-unanimous jury provision to nullify \\nthe votes of Black jurors and allow white jurors to more easily convict Black defendants. \\nLouisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury provision \\nworked exactly as intended. Up until 2018, when \\nLouisianans voted to remove the non-unanimous jury \\nprovision from their constitution, Black defendants were more likely to be convicted by non-unanimous juries than white defendants, and Black jurors were more likely than white jurors to be in the dissent. \\nThus, despite jury service being a hallmark of \\nAmerican citizenship, for ov er a century, Louisiana\\u2019s \\n3 \\n \\n non-unanimous jury provision effectively undermined \\nBlack participation on juries. \\nLouisiana has been permitted to thwart the \\nintent of the Reconstruction Congress in this manner because of this Court\\u2019s decision in Apodaca v. Oregon , \\n406 U.S. 404 (1972), in which Justice Powell\\u2019s idiosyncratic view that the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement does not apply to the States \\nwas the controlling opinion. Th is is the rare case in \\nwhich stare decisis should not control, and this Court \\nshould hold that the Sixth Amendment requires state juries\\u2014like federal juries\\u2014to be unanimous. \\nARGUMENT \\nI. THE HISTORY OF THE FOURTEENTH \\nAMENDMENT COMPELS THE INCORPORATION OF THE SIXTH AMENDMENT UNANIMOUS JURY TRIAL \\nRIGHT.  \\nThis Court recently reiterated that \\u201c[a] Bill of \\nRights protection is inco rporated . . . if it is \\n\\u2018fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty,\\u2019 or \\n\\u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\\u2019s history and tradition.\\u2019\\u201d  \\nTimbs v.

Id. at 413. \\nJustice White could not \\u201cassume that the majority of \\nthe jury will refuse to weigh the evidence and reach a \\ndecision upon rational grounds . . . or that a majority will deprive a man of his liberty on the basis of prejudice when a minority is presenting a reasonable argument in favor of acquittal.\\u201d Id. Justice White \\n\\u201csimply [found] no proof for the notion that a majority \\nwill disregard its instructions and cast its votes for \\nguilt or innocence based on prejudice rather than \\nevidence.\\u201d Id. at 413-14.  \\nIn so reasoning, Justice White\\u2019s opinion does not \\nreckon with the overwhelming evidence that shows \\nLouisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury provision was \\nenacted with discriminatory intent and was designed to facilitate white jurors being able to convict Black defendants over the dissent of Black jurors.  \\nAfter Reconstruction ended and federal troops left \\nthe South, Louisianan Democrats called a \\n12 \\n \\n Constitutional Convention in 1898.33 As two scholars \\nof this period summarized, \\u201cthe sinister purpose of the Convention was to create a racial architecture in \\nLouisiana that could circumvent the Reconstruction \\nAmendments and marginalize the political power of black citizens.\\u201d\\n34 It was at this Convention that \\nLouisiana ratified its non-unanimous jury \\nprovision.35  \\nThe Convention\\u2019s official record is replete with \\nreferences to its racist goals.

The story of two Black Louisianans who recently served as jurors\\u2014Willie Newton and Bobbie Howard\\u2014compellingly illustrates this point.\\n64 \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard were both born and \\nraised in the small town of Houma, in Terrebonne Parish; the same town where Evangelisto Ramos \\nworked. Mr. Newton, who is 72 years old, runs a \\nfamily business selling burial vaults. Sixty-three-\\n                                                \\n61 Id. at 1637. \\n62 Id. at 1639.  \\n63 Id.  \\n64 Mr. Newtown and Mr. Howard\\u2019s story stems from an interview \\nthat the men did with the Advocate , see Adelson et al., supra  \\nnote 57, and follow up interviews with undersigned counsel. Everything quoted is from their interviews with counsel unless attributed otherwise. \\n19 \\n \\n year-old Mr. Howard has his own accounting practice. \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard both attended segregated schools growing up. In fact, they went to \\nthe same high school, as there was only one in the \\nParish that educated Black children. \\nIn 2014, two years before Mr. Ramos faced trial \\nfor second-degree murder, Mr. Newton and Mr. Howard were selected to serve on the jury for the trial \\nof Matthew Allen, a 20-year-old Black man also \\naccused of second-degree murder. The prosecution\\u2019s \\ntheory was that Mr. Allen intentionally shot and killed the victim; Mr. Allen\\u2019 s defense to the charge \\nwas that he acted in self-defense.\\n65 Mr. Newton and \\nMr. Howard were the only Black jurors. The other ten \\njurors on Mr. Allen\\u2019s jury were white.  \\nMr. Newton vividly recalled  his feelings when he \\nsaw the jury\\u2019s composition: \\u201cBobby and I saw from the beginning that our vote wasn\\u2019t going to matter. We \\nwere outnumbered.\\u201d \\u201cI could have just stayed home.\\u201d \\n\\u201cAin\\u2019t no difference we can make.\\u201d Mr. Newton felt \\ndoubly distraught when he saw that Mr. Allen had a \\u201cbad judge\\u201d who had been reprimanded for wearing blackface.\\n66 Mr. Newton thought to himself, \\u201cBuddy, \\nyou\\u2019re doomed.\\u201d \\n                                                \\n65 See State v. Allen , 2015-0675, 2015 WL 6951570, at *2 (La. Ct. \\nApp. 2015).  \\n66 In 2004, Judge Timothy Ellender was suspended for wearing \\nblackface, handcuffs, and a jail jumpsuit to a Halloween party.  \\nSee Seth Fox, Houma Judge Suspended for Wearing Blackface \\nHalloween Costume , Houma Today (Dec. 13, 2014), \\n20 \\n \\n Reflecting back, Mr. Newton and Mr. Howard \\nthought Mr. Allen\\u2019s race worked against him with the white jurors. \\u201cThey see a Black defendant in a drug \\ndeal and maybe think \\u2018he\\u2019s hustling corner to corner, \\nlet\\u2019s teach him a lesson,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Howard speculated. Mr. Newton echoed this sentiment: \\u201cI think they saw him \\nas a potential threat to the community.\\u201d  \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard looked at Mr. Allen \\ndifferently. They saw a young man who may have \\nmade a mistake, but who still had a life ahead of him. \\nMr. Howard thought these differing perspectives could be due to the fact \\u201ctheir life experiences were different.\\u201d  \\nAfter listening intently to the evidence, both Mr. \\nHoward and Newton favored finding Mr. Allen guilty of manslaughter. \\u201cI thought about his age. I thought he deserved a second chance,\\u201d Mr. Howard said quietly. Mr. Newton confirmed that he \\u201cnever thought \\nit was second-degree murder\\u201d and proposed to his \\nfellow jurors that Mr. Allen should be convicted of \\nmanslaughter, not murder.  \\nDeliberations gave both men hope that at least \\nsome of the white jurors would see the evidence their \\nway and would find Mr. Allen guilty of manslaughter, \\nnot murder. Mr. Howard recalled that one juror, a white woman, seemed to be leaning in favor of manslaughter going into lunch. Mr. Newton remembered there being two or three white jurors \\n                                                \\nhttps://www.houmatoday.com/article/DA/20041213/News/60809\\n9465/HC/.   \\n21 \\n \\n who seemed to think manslaughter was the just \\nconviction. \\nThings took a turn after lunch, however. Mr. \\nHoward recounted that he and Mr. Newton had lunch together, while the white jurors ate together. When they returned from lunch, all ten white jurors wanted to vote for second-degree murder; there was no convincing them otherwise, \\u201ceveryone was set in their \\nways.\\u201d  \\nMr. Newton\\u2019s prediction that his vote wouldn\\u2019t \\nmatter proved prescient. Th e jury convicted Mr. Allen \\nof second-degree murder by a vote of 10-2. All ten \\nwhite jurors voted for guilt. Mr. Newton and Mr. \\nHoward voted not guilty. \\nWhat took place troubled Mr. Howard and Mr. \\nNewton. Mr. Howard recalled: \\u201cI pretty much felt sorry for the young man, to tell you the truth.\\u201d Mr. \\nNewton was more shaken: \\u201cIt hurt me real bad when \\nI looked at that young man, and I looked at his mother and father, and I knew they weren\\u2019t going to see him again, not unless they go up to Angola.\\u201d\\n67 Indeed, Mr. \\nNewton felt the effects of the trial long after it was \\nover: \\u201cWhen I left that jury, it took me a couple of \\nweeks to get myself together. Serving on that jury \\ntook something out of me.\\u201d Mr. Allen, who entered prison for a crime he a when he was only 20, continues to serve a life sentence in Angola Prison.   \\n                                                \\n67 Adelson et al., supra note 57. \\n22 \\n \\n Mr. Newton realized that what happened in Mr. \\nAllen\\u2019s trial probably happened in many others, causing him to wonder, \\u201cHow many others had passed \\nthis way . . . and got the same treatment this boy got.\\u201d \\nThe trial, Mr. Newton explained, made him feel like his \\u201cvoice didn\\u2019t matter,\\u201d \\u201ca second-class citizen.\\u201d  \\nThis experience confirmed for Mr. Newton that \\nLouisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury system was unfair to \\nBlack defendants and Black jurors. In his opinion, the \\nprosecutors \\u201cfound a way to get around the system\\u201d \\nby limiting the number of Black people on Mr. Allen\\u2019s jury to two, knowing they only needed ten votes for a conviction. The trial shook Mr. Newton\\u2019s confidence in \\nthe fairness of Louisiana\\u2019s justice system: \\u201cI know I \\ncouldn\\u2019t sit there and think I\\u2019d get a fair trial.\\u201d  \\nMr. Newton took solace in the fact Louisiana \\nvoters repealed the non-unanimous jury provision last year.\\n68 He expressed that while he does think that \\n\\u201cjustice was served\\u201d during Mr. Allen\\u2019s trial, he felt \\n\\u201cencouraged\\u201d and \\u201cempowered\\u201d to serve on a jury now that his vote was guaranteed to matter. Mr. Howard \\nsaid that he, too, is ready to perform his \\u201ccivic duty\\u201d \\nand serve on a jury under Louisiana\\u2019s new unanimous jury scheme.  \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard\\u2019s experience is a \\nstark example of the indign ities inflicted upon Black \\npeople by Louisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury provision. It is a reminder that, until last year, Louisiana\\u2019s non-\\nunanimous jury system worked the way its racist \\n                                                \\n68 Oregon is now the only state with a non-unanimous jury \\nprovision. \\n23 \\n \\n proponents intended\\u2014to more easily convict Black \\ndefendants and to silence Black jurors. What makes this even worse, is that this system, conceived from \\nracism, has been operating with this Court\\u2019s blessing \\nfor 47 years. Apodaca must be overruled. This Court \\nshould hold that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity \\nrequirement against the States.  \\n \\n  \\n24 \\n \\n CONCLUSION \\nLDF respectfully urges this Court to hold that the \\nFourteenth Amendment incorporates the Sixth \\nAmendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement against the States.  \\nRespectfully submitted,  \\n \\nSherrilyn A.

While debating the extent to \\nwhich the Constitution should enshrine protections for religious freedom during the First Congress, \\nRepresentative Daniel Carroll of Maryland\\u2014one of \\nthe few Catholics among the Constitution\\u2019s \\nFramers\\u2014remarked \\u201cthe rights of conscience are, in \\ntheir nature, of peculiar delicacy, and will little bear \\nthe gentlest touch of governmental hand.\\u201d 1 Annals \\nof Cong. 757-58 (Joseph Gales ed., 1834) (Aug. 15, 1789). \\nNowhere are the rights of the religious more \\ndelicate than when they intersect with the freedom \\nto put faith into action, belief into words. If the \\nrobust religious freedom protections guaranteed by \\nour Constitution are to have any meaning, they must \\nbe capable of shielding a sincere religious believer from being coerced into speaking against the core \\ntenants of her faith. To hold otherwise would be to \\npermit the heavy hand of government to extinguish \\nreligious practice. This the Constitution will not \\nallow. \\nThe Founders understood that the First \\nAmendment, as drafted, protected all religious sects in their right to speak freely in accordance with their \\nfaith. Indeed, the Founding Generation believed \\nprotections for religious lib erty to be of utmost \\nimport. Since its founding, America has been gripped \\n 3 \\nin debate over religious liberty. Even before the \\ncolonies declared their independence, there were \\nenergetic discussions over the bounds of religious \\ntoleration versus a full freedom to exercise religion \\n(with only limited exceptions). Ultimately, the \\nConstitution\\u2019s drafters settled on James Madison\\u2019s \\nview of an unalienable right to practice one\\u2019s \\nreligious faith. Owed to an understanding that the Governor of the Universe supersedes any earthly \\nauthority, religious convictions were understood to \\ncommand greater deference than mere personal \\nopinions. Where opinion was required to yield to the \\nlaw, tensions between law and religious belief often \\nresulted in exemption for the believer. \\nThe Founding Generation also viewed religious \\nliberty as encompassing more  than mere matters of \\nconscience or decisions on the rightness or wrongness \\nof acts. Instead, the full ex ercise of religion offered a \\nright to act in accordance with one\\u2019s faith and, \\nnecessarily, included protection from government \\ncompelled speech that violated a believer\\u2019s firmly \\nheld religious convictions. This distinction was \\nperhaps most clearly expressed in the early colonies\\u2019 \\nanti-Catholic prejudices. In colonial Georgia, for example, while all worshipers were vested by its \\nCharter with a liberty of conscience, Catholics were \\nexpressly excluded from protections for the more \\nrobust free exercise of religion. McConnell, The \\nOrigins and Historical Understanding of Free \\nExercise of Religion, 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1409, 1489-90 \\n(1989) (hereinafter McConnell, Origins). \\nInformed by the debates and experiences of their \\ntime, the Founders opted to include among the Constitution\\u2019s protections the more extensive free \\n 4 \\nexercise of religion. In so doing, they extended the \\nmaximum protections available to all who professed \\nbelief in a Universal Sovereign. These protections, it \\nwas understood, included a right to act out belief and \\nto speak, or refrain from speaking, freely, in \\naccordance with faith. \\nWith this understanding as background, it is \\nclear the First Amendment provides dual protections for religious expression (or non-expression) in its \\nguarantees of free speech and free religious exercise. \\nThis reality compels the \",\n          \" \\n No. 19-1189 \\n================================================================================================================ \\nIn The \\nSupreme Court of the United States \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 --------------------------------- \\nBP P.L.C., et al., \\nPetitioners,        \\nv. \\nMAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE, \\nRespondent.        \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 --------------------------------- \\nOn Petition For Writ Of Certiorari \\nTo The United States Court Of Appeals \\nFor The Fourth Circuit  \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 --------------------------------- \\nBRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE  \\nENERGY POLICY ADVOCATES \\nIN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS \\nFILED BY CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 --------------------------------- \\nMATTHEW  D.

Religious observers have \\nwelcomed the relief from government oppression. No \\nlonger can religious believers be excluded solely \\nbecause of their religious identity. Free are the religious to express their religious views without fear \\nof government reprisal. This Court\\u2019s precedents have \\nbeen unequivocal: if government can achieve its \\nmeans without burdening religion, the Constitution \\nalmost always requires that it must. \\nAnother truism is derived from this Court\\u2019s \\nprecedents. When religious liberty concerns are coupled with free expression, the Constitution \\ndemands the most exacting scrutiny. That is because \\nthe First Amendment, as understood from the \\nFounding, provides special protection for the \\n 5 \\nreligious, their right to speak freely, and their right \\nto refrain from speaking. Distinct from pure \\ncommercial speech, religious speech demands a \\nhigher constitutional protection. That is why, to \\nAmicus Curiae\\u2019s knowledge, government compelled \\nreligious speech has never been held to survive strict \\nscrutiny. \\nAgainst this backdrop, the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s opinion \\ncannot stand. Although purporting to apply strict scrutiny, the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s analysis is rife with \\nflaws, each one fatal to the court\\u2019s conclusion. From \\nthe outset, the Tenth Circuit failed to recognize the \\npreferred status of Ms. Smith\\u2019s free speech rights, \\ngrounded as they are in her religious beliefs. This \\nfailure is only compounded by the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s lethargic narrow-tailoring analysis. Far from the \\nexacting analysis this Court requires, the Tenth \\nCircuit settles into a now familiar pattern to those of \\nfaith\\u2014ostracizing Ms. Smith from society because of \\nher religious identity. \\nOnce again, this Court must reverse yet another \\nassault on religious freedom by declaring that where, as here, free speech and religion intersect, \\nconstitutional protections are at their greatest. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 6 \\nARGUMENT \\nI. AS ORIGINALLY UNDERSTOOD , THE FIRST \\nAMENDMENT PROTECTED THE RIGHT OF THE \\nRELIGIOUS TO SPEAK AND TO REMAIN SILENT . \\nThe First Amendment is \\u201cunique in form among \\namendments to the Constitution.\\u201d2 It is drafted, not \\nas a grant of privileges or rights to the people, but as \\na disability on Congress\\u2019 ability to act. Report to the Attorney General, supra  note 2, at 15\\u201316. In its \\nentirety, the First Amendment reads: \\nCongress shall make no law respecting \\nan establishment of religion, or \\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; or \\nabridging the freedom of speech, or of \\nthe press; or the right of the people \\npeaceably to assemble, and to petition \\nthe Government for a redress of grievances.  \\nU.S.\\n Const., Amdt. 1. \\nIn barring certain kinds of laws, the First \\nAmendment recognizes a pre-existing \\u201cimmun[ity] from such legislative action.\\u201d Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral, supra note 2, at 16. This reflects an \\nunderstanding by the Founding Generation that these \\u201care pre-existent rights\\u2014inalienable rights\\u2014\\n                                           \\n2 O f f i c e  o f  L e g a l  P o l i c y ,  D e p t  o f  J u s t i c e ,  R e p o r t  t o  t h e  \\nAttorney General: Religious Li berty Under the Free Exercise \\nClause at 15 (1986) (hereinafter Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral). \\n 7 \\nand not mere civil privileges conferred by a \\nbenevolent sovereign.\\u201d Id. \\nTaken together, the text, history, and philosophy \\nof the First Amendment establish the principle that \\n\\u201cthe government has no right to interfere with the \\nfree exercise of religion\\u201d unless the \\u201cgovernment \\naction is necessary to prevent manifest danger to the \\nexistence of the state; to protect public peace, safety, \\nand order; or to secure the religious liberty of \\nothers.\\u201d Id., at v. And, even then, only if the \\ngovernment deploys \\u201cthe least restrictive means \\nnecessary to protect these interests.\\u201d Id. This is true \\nas a matter of the First Amendment\\u2019s Religious Liberty Clauses. And because freedom of religion \\ncannot be divorced from freedom of expression, it is \\neven more true when the government tries to force a \\nbeliever to speak in a way that cannot be reconciled \\nwith her religious convictions. \\nA. Religious liberty was profoundly \\nimportant to the Founding Generation; \\nreligious convictions were understood \\nto receive greater deference than mere \\npersonal opinion. \\n1. The Founding Generation was uniquely \\nattuned to issues regarding the proper relationship \\nbetween religion and government. Indeed, at the time of America\\u2019s founding there was \\u201can intense and \\ncontroversial theoretical debate\\u201d of these issues \\ninvolving \\u201c[m]ost of the great political thinkers of the \\nperiod.\\u201d McConnell, Origins, at 1430. These thinkers \\ninformed the Founders\\u2019 own debates on the issue and \\nundoubtedly \\u201cinfluenced the American solution to \\nthe problem.\\u201d Id.  \\n 8 \\nJohn Locke, perhaps more than any other \\nphilosopher who contributed to the ideas \\nunderpinning America\\u2019s founding, provided the \\n\\u201cmost extensive\\u201d discussion of religion and most \\ndirectly influenced the Framers\\u2019 drafting of the First \\nAmendment. Id. Locke was an early and influential \\ntheoretical thinker and advocate for religious freedom. Id., at 1431. In his view \\u201creligious rivalry \\nand intolerance\\u201d were \\u201camong the most important of political problems,\\u201d and \\u201c[r]eligious intolerance was inconsistent both with public peace and with good \\ngovernment.\\u201d Id. \\nLocke\\u2019s solution, however, was an \\u201cunderstanding \\nof religious toleration,\\u201d that \\u201cexpressly precludes free \\nexercise exemptions.\\u201d Id., at 1435. To Locke, when \\n\\u201cindividual conscience conflicts with the governmental policy, the government will always \\nprevail and the individual will always be forced to \\nsubmit or suffer the punishment.\\u201d Id. Locke\\u2019s \\ninfluence on the drafters of the First Amendment makes it all the more remarkable that his view did \\nnot triumph with America\\u2019s founding. \\nThe American Revolution upended the \\npreexisting relationship between religion and government, especially in states where the Anglican \\nChurch had the most influence. Id., at 1436. \\n\\u201cAmerica was in the wake of a great religious \\nrevival,\\u201d that brought with it a \\u201cdrive for religious \\nfreedom.\\u201d Id., at 1437\\u201338. Along with this drive came \\na push from \\u201creligious supporters of disestablishment and free exercise\\u201d to enshrine \\n\\u201cconstitutional protections\\u201d for religious freedoms \\u201cat the federal level.\\u201d Id., at 1440. \\n 9 \\nThis movement was encapsulated in debate \\nsurrounding the religious liberty clause in Virginia\\u2019s \\n1776 Bill of Rights. When George Mason proposed \\nusing the Lockean phrase \\u201ctoleration of religion,\\u201d \\nJames Madison objected, complaining that the \\nphrase implied an act of legislative grace (which, to \\nLocke, it did). Id. , at 1443. Madison was not alone \\namong the Founding Generation in rejecting this concept. George Washin gton and Thomas Paine \\nsimilarly eschewed \\u201ctoleration,\\u201d decrying its \\nimplication of government \\u201cindulgence\\u201d rather than a \\nfundamental, preexisting right. Id., at 1443\\u201344. \\nMoreover, Madison objected to Mason\\u2019s proposal \\nbecause it excepted from even the \\u201ctoleration\\u201d of \\nreligious freedom any instance where \\u201cunder color of \\nreligion any man disturb the peace, the happiness, or \\nsafety of society.\\u201d See G. Hunt, James Madison and \\nReligious Liberty, 1 Ann. Rep. Am. Hist. A. 163, 166 \\n(1901). It was Madison\\u2019s belief that such phrasing \\n\\u201cmight easily be so twisted as to oppress religious \\nsects under the excuse that they disturbed \\u2018the \\npeace, the happiness, or safety of society.\\u2019\\u201d Id. \\nMadison\\u2019s objections were heard by Virginia\\u2019s \\nassembly. As adopted, Virginia\\u2019s Bill of Rights \\npromised that all \\u201care equally entitled to the free \\nexercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience,\\u201d and reminded only \\u201cthat\\n it is the mutual \\nduty of all to practice Christian forbearance, love, and charity towards each other.\\u201d Report to the \\nAttorney General, supra  note 2, at 102\\u201303. \\n2. This early debate between Madison and Mason \\nbears witness to what this Court has long noted\\u2014\\nthat Madison was \\u201cthe leading architect of the \\n 10\\nreligion clauses of the First Amendment.\\u201d Hosanna-\\nTabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v. \\nEEOC , 565 U.S. 171, 184 (2012) (internal quotation \\nmarks omitted). Madison\\u2019s rejection of religious \\ntolerance in favor of full and free religious expression permeates his Memorial and Remonstrance . \\nExplaining that \\u201c[t]he Religion then of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every \\nman,\\u201d Madison understood that it is not just \\u201cthe \\nright of every man to exercise it as these may \\ndictate,\\u201d but further \\u201cthe duty of every man to render \\nto the Creator such homage, and such only, as he \\nbelieves to be acceptable to him.\\u201d J. Madison, \\nMemorial and Remonstrance \\u00a7 1 (1785), reprinted in \\nEverson v. Bd. of Educ. , 330 U.S. 1, 64 (1947). This \\nright, Madison admonished, \\u201cis in its nature an unalienable right.\\u201d Id. \\nMadison expounded his view that \\u201c[t]his duty is \\nprecedent both in order of time and degree of \\nobligation, to the claims of Civil Society.\\u201d Id. Before \\nanyone is \\u201ca member of Civil Society,\\u201d they are \\u201cconsidered as a subject of the Governor of the \\nUniverse.\\u201d Id. For this reason, \\u201cin matters of \\nReligion, no man\\u2019s right is abridged by the institution of Civil Society.\\u201d Id. But Madison went \\nfurther. \\u201c[I]f religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that \\nof the Legislative Body.\\u201d Id., at \\u00a7 2, reprinted in \\nEverson , 330 U.S., at 65. Legislators who \\n\\u201cencroach[]\\u201d on the rights of the people, Madison \\nsaid, \\u201cexceed the commission from which they derive their authority, and are Tyrants.\\u201d Id. \\nRecognizing that Madison\\u2019s Memorial and \\nRemonstrance is not law, see City of Boerne v. Flores , \\n 11\\n521 U.S. 507, 541 (1997) (Scalia, J., concurring), it \\nnonetheless offers a clear understanding of why the \\nFounding Generation thought it so crucial to \\nmemorialize the inalienable freedom of religion in \\nthe First Amendment. And Madison\\u2019s defense of the \\nAmerican conception of religious liberty merely \\nechoed the prevalent thought at the founding \\u201cof the \\ndifference between religious faith and other forms of human judgment.\\u201d McConnell, Origins, at 1496. \\nAt the Founding, the prevailing view was that the \\n\\u201copinions of individuals\\u201d can not take \\u201cprecedence \\nover the decisions of civil society.\\u201d Id. The same was \\nnot true for religious convictions. \\u201cConflicts arising from religious convictions were conceived not as a \\nclash between the judgment of the individual and of \\nthe state, but as a conflict between earthly and \\nspiritual sovereigns.\\u201d Id. In those instances, the \\nperson holding the religious conviction \\u201cwas not seen as the instigator of the conflict; the believer was simply caught between the inconsistent demands of \\ntwo rightful authorities, through no fault of his own.\\u201d \\nId. This view is essential to understanding the \\nFounders\\u2019 belief that \\u201cfreedom of religion is unalienable because it is a duty to God and not a \\nprivilege of the individual.\\u201d Id., at 1497. \\n3. Bolstering this understanding, the historical \\nrecord surrounding adoption of the Bill of Rights \\nsuggests that the First Amendment\\u2019s use of the term \\u201creligion\\u201d was a deliberate choice. See McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1488. Although \\u201c[t]he recorded debates \\nin\\u201d both chambers of Congress \\u201ccast little light on the \\nmeaning of the free exercise clause,\\u201d looking at \\nsuccessive drafts of the clause from its consideration \\nand debate in the First Congress are especially \\n 12\\nenlightening. Id., at 1481, 1483. While earlier drafts \\nof the First Amendment used the phrase \\u201crights of \\nconscience,\\u201d the final version that emerged enshrined in the First Amendment a protection for the \\u201cfree \\nexercise of religion.\\u201d Id., at 1488. This phrasing lends \\nfurther support to the Founders\\u2019 understanding of religious freedoms. \\nTo the Founders, \\u201c[b]elief in a Supreme Being \\nwas\\u201d essential to \\u201creligion.\\u201d Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral, supra  note 2, at 9. Indeed, \\u201c[t]he historical \\nmaterials uniformly equate \\u2018religion\\u2019 with belief in God or in gods.\\u201d McConnell, Origins, at 1493. These references \\u201ccan be extended without distortion to \\ntranscendent extrapersonal authorities not \\nenvisioned in traditionally theistic terms\\u201d\\u2014for \\nexample, Madison\\u2019s use of \\u201cCreator,\\u201d \\u201cGovernor of \\nthe Universe,\\u201d and \\u201cUniversal Sovereign,\\u201d imply \\u201can attempt at a definition more compendious than the \\nfamiliar Judeo-Christian God, but it retains the distinction between transcendent authority and \\npersonal judgment.\\u201d Id.  \\nReligion, as understood by the Founders and \\nexpressed in the First Amendment, then, is best \\ndefined to encompass \\u201ca system of beliefs, whether \\npersonally or institutionally held, prompted by the \\nacceptance of transcendent realities or \\nacknowledging extratemporal actions.\\u201d Report to the \\nAttorney General, supra note 2, at 26\\u201327. This \\ninterpretation of religion is both accurate to the Founders\\u2019 understanding and consistent with their view that religion encompasses \\u201cduties that were \\nbeyond the jurisdiction of the state either to \\nprescribe or to proscribe.\\u201d Id., at 9. To the Founders, \\nreligion encompassed a subservience to a \\n 13\\n\\u201ctranscendent reality,\\u201d which if abandoned could \\nunleash \\u201cextratemporal consequences.\\u201d Id., at 29. \\nThis explains their motivation to preserve a robust freedom from government \\u201cinterfere[nce] with such \\nbeliefs or duties.\\u201d Id. \\nB. The Founding Generation\\u2019s understanding of religious liberty \\nencompassed protection for believers \\nfrom compelled speech that violates \\nfirmly held religious beliefs. \\n1. The least controversial point about the phrase \\n\\u201cfree exercise\\u201d is that \\u201cby definition, the words denote action or activity.\\u201d Id., at 19. To the Founders, \\nreligious liberty undoubtedly included \\u201creligiously motivated conduct  as well as belief.\\u201d McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1488 (emphasis added). This point bears emphasis because of this Court\\u2019s history rejecting \\nsuch a reading. See  Reynolds v. United States , 98 \\nU.S. 145, 164 (1878); but see Fulton v. City of Phila. , \\n141 S. Ct. 1868, 1913 (2021) (Alito, J., concurring) \\n(noting \\u201c[t]he Court ha[s] repudiated that distinction\\u201d in Reynolds  \\u201cthat the Free Exercise \\nClause protects beliefs, not conduct\\u201d). \\nIn substituting the \\u201crights of conscience\\u201d in favor \\nof a protection for the \\u201cfree exercise of religion,\\u201d the \\nFramer\\u2019s chose a phrase that \\u201cstrongly connoted \\naction,\\u201d in place of one that suggested mere opinion \\nor belief. McConnell, Origins, at 1489. Leading \\ndictionaries of that era defined \\u201cexercise\\u201d to include \\n\\u201c[l]abour of the body,\\u201d \\u201c[t]ask; that which one is \\nappointed to perform,\\u201d \\u201c[a]ct of divine worship, \\nwhether public or private,\\u201d or \\u201c[t]o use or practice.\\u201d See id.  (collecting dictionary definitions). Conscience, \\n 14\\non the other hand, was more likely to imply a \\n\\u201cnatural knowledge, or the faculty that decides on \\nthe right or wrong of actions.\\u201d Id. (quoting N. \\nWebster, A Dictionary of The English Language 301 (New Haven 1807)). \\nParticularly instructive on this distinction is the \\nGeorgia Charter of 1732. The Charter included \\u201ca \\nliberty of conscience allowe d in the worship of God, \\nto all persons,\\u201d but reserved the more exclusive right to \\u201ca free exercise of religion,\\u201d only to \\u201call such persons, except papists.\\u201d Id., at 1489\\u201390. By granting \\nCatholics only a liberty of conscience, but not the free exercise of religion, the Georgia Charter necessarily \\nreserved a fuller right to non-Catholic worshipers. \\nOne scholar has observed that \\u201c[t]he most plausible \\nreading of the provision is that it permitted Catholics \\nto believe what they wished . . . but did not permit \\nthem to put their faith into action.\\u201d Id., at 1490. \\nBy including a full and robust \\u201cfree exercise of \\nreligion\\u201d within the First Amendment, the Founders understood that they were protecting not only the \\nright for the religious to believe what their faith \\ntaught, but to put those beliefs into action. To \\nconclude otherwise would be to \\u201ctrivialize the idea of \\nreligion by separating thought from life, faith from \\nworks.\\u201d Report to the Attorney General, supra note \\n2, at 31. Possessing \\u201ca right to believe something in one\\u2019s mind without the freedom to utter it, advocate it, or even translate it into life,\\u201d is hardly a \\nsubstantive freedom at all. Id., at 31\\u201332. \\n2. Consistent with the Founders\\u2019 understanding \\nof a robust religious liberty protection that included \\nthe right to act out your faith was the axiom that \\n 15\\naction naturally includes expression or the freedom \\nto refrain from expression that conflicts with belief. \\nAlthough early religious liberty controversies were \\nrelatively limited, the historical record includes \\nexamples of protections for religious exercise \\nintertwined with such expressive activity. \\nAn early source of common conflict, for example, \\narose around the issue of oath requirements. Oaths \\nserved as \\u201cthe principal means of ensuring honest \\ntestimony and solemnizing obligations.\\u201d McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1467. But many early religious sects \\nrefused to take an oath, believing it was in conflict \\nwith the teachings of the New Testament.3 Id. \\nBecause oaths were required before court testimony, this refusal often left these sincere religious objectors \\nwithout access to the court system. Id. \\nIn response, many of the early colonies adopted \\nalternatives, allowing relig ious dissenters to take a \\npledge or make an affirmation rather than to swear \\nan oath. Id., at 1467\\u201368 (\\u201cBy 1789, virtually all of the \\nstates had enacted oath exemptions.\\u201d). This simple solution permitted religious sects access to the court \\nsystem, without requiring them to act out of step \\n                                           \\n3 See Matthew 5:33-37 (\\u201cAgain, ye have heard that it hath \\nbeen said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, \\nbut shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: But I say unto you, \\nSwear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: Nor \\nby the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is \\nthe city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy \\nhead, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever \\nis more than these cometh of evil.\\u201d). \\n 16\\nwith their religious beliefs or to make an expression \\nthey found incompatible with their faith. \\nA still more extreme example of laws yielding to \\nexpressive activities of religious sects in the \\nFounding Generation can be found in colonial \\nGeorgia. There, the Trus tees of Georgia granted \\ncertain groups of religious refugees a general exemption from the laws that allowed them \\u201cto organize themselves in accordance with their own \\nfaith.\\u201d Id., at 1471. One historia n described one such \\ngroup from Salzburg\\u2014which formed the town of Ebenezer\\u2014as \\u201ca state within a state, a sort of \\ntheocracy under the direction of their minsters with \\ndaily conferences of the entire congregation in which \\nGod\\u2019s guidance was invoked at the beginning and the \\nend.\\u201d Id. Although these groups where required to \\nobey certain colonial laws pertaining to military service, property, and good governance, they were \\n\\u201cotherwise free to govern themselves.\\u201d Id. at 1471 \\nn.312 \\nAnother founding era example of religious \\nexemptions for expressive action appeared in North \\nCarolina and Maryland. There, laws exempted \\nmembers of certain religious sects from a \\nrequirement to remove their hat in court. Id. The \\nreligious objectors viewed such an action as \\u201ca form of obeisance to secular authority forbidden by their \\nreligion.\\u201d Id., at 1472. Rather than forcing members \\nof these sects to choose be tween access to the courts \\nor expressing themselves in violation of their religious beliefs, states offered an exemption. \\nWhile this example may seem trivial by today\\u2019s \\nstandards, it was very mu ch on the minds of the \\n 17\\nFounding Generation. At the time, \\u201c[o]ne of the most \\nnotorious courtroom cases of religious intolerance in \\nEngland involved William Penn\\u2019s refusal to remove \\nhis hat when he appeared in court\\u201d to face \\nindictment for speaking to  an unlawful assembly. Id. \\nWhen Penn refused to remove a court-furnished hat from his head in respect to the court, he was held in \\ncontempt and imprisoned. Id. This case attracted \\nsignificant attention in America, and undoubtedly influenced the exemptions passed in North Carolina and Maryland. Id. \\nIndeed, the importance of this exemption was \\ndemonstrated in debates over the Bill of Rights in \\nthe First Congress. Id., at 1472, n.320. In ridiculing \\nthe list of freedoms proposed to be protected, Theodore Sedgwick of Mass achusetts remarked \\u201cthey \\nmight have declared that a man should have a right to wear his hat if he pleased . . . but he would ask the \\ngentleman whether he thought it necessary to enter \\nthese trifles in a declaration of rights.\\u201d Id. (citation \\nomitted). With unmistakable reference to the Penn case, John Page of Virginia replied: \\nThe gentleman from \\nMassachusetts . . . objects to the clause, \\nbecause the right is of so trivial a \\nnature. He supposes it no more \\nessential than whether a man has a \\nright to wear his hat or not; but let me \\nobserve to him that such rights have \\nbeen opposed, and a man has been obliged to pull off his hat when he \\nappeared before the face of authority; \\npeople have also been prevented from \\n 18\\nassembling together on their lawful \\noccasions.  \\nId. (citation omitted). Certainly, the Founders were \\nacutely aware of the potential for abuse by \\nauthorities absent a robust religious liberty \\nprotection that clearly extended to actions, including \\nreligiously motivated expression or non-expression. \\n3. Taken together, the Free Exercise Clause and \\nthe Free Speech Clause elevate the freedom not to \\nspeak out of accordance with firmly held religious beliefs to the highest echelon of First Amendment \\nprotection. This conclusion is buttressed by the First \\nAmendment\\u2019s other guarantees\\u2014e.g., freedom of \\nassembly and freedom to petition the government. If \\nthe Free Exercise Clause conferred nothing more \\nthan a \\u201cright to express religious beliefs,\\u201d it would \\n\\u201cadd nothing to the First Amendment, since that right is fully protected by the right to assemble, \\nspeak, and publish.\\u201d Report to the Attorney General, \\nsupra note 2, at 19. Indeed, \\u201cbecause religious \\nexpression is doubly protected by the constitutional \\ntext\\u201d it would make little sense if it were \\u201cless \\nprotected in practice.\\u201d Id. , at 19, n.30. \\nThe examples cited above represent a clear \\nunderstanding by the Founding Generation that civil \\nlaws, even of general applicability, must yield when they conflict with religious expression or the freedom \\nto refrain from expression on the basis of a sincerely \\nheld religious belief. As it seems early legislative \\nbodies believed exemptions in such cases were \\nrequired by the principle of free exercise, it stands to \\nreason that the Framers understood \\u201csimilar \\napplications of the principle\\u201d would guide the courts \\n 19\\nin these cases, once \\u201centrusted with the \\nresponsibility of enforcing\\u201d First Amendment \\nguarantees. McConnell, Origins, at 1473. \\nAlthough there was a dearth of litigation over \\nreligious liberty protections in the early years of the \\nRepublic, what scarce examples exist support this \\nview. Consider, for example, the earliest state court \\nopinion addressing the issue of a religious liberty exemption, People v. Phillips . In that case, the court \\nheld that the New York Constitution protected a Catholic priest from compulsory testimony to \\nmatters learned while administering the Sacrament \\nof Confession. See  id., at 1504. \\nImportant to the Phillips court was the notion \\nthat requiring testimony from the priest to \\u201cwhat he \\nreceives in confession, is to declare that there shall \\nbe no penance; and this important branch of the Roman Catholic religion would be thus annihilated.\\u201d \\nId. (citation omitted). The court did not believe it was \\ncompatible with religious liberty to compel expression that would so eviscerate a core belief of Catholic faith. Rather than establishing a special \\nprivilege for adherents to the Catholic faith, though, \\nthe court viewed its actions as necessary to ensure \\nCatholics received the same  treatment as Protestants \\n(the dominant faith at the time) in the administration of their sacraments. Id., at 1504-05. \\nThe through line to the Founding Generation\\u2019s \\nunderstanding of religious liberty was a belief that \\nsuch freedom was without substantive meaning if it did not encompass expression, and non-expression, \\nrooted in religious belief. Noted Nineteenth Century \\n 20\\nConstitutional commentator, Michigan Supreme \\nCourt Justice Thomas Cooley, explained: \\nAn earnest believer usually regards it as his duty to propagate his opinions, \\nand to bring others to his views. To \\ndeprive him of this right is to take from \\nhim the power to perform what he \\nconsiders a most sacred obligation.  \\nT. Cooley, A Treatise on the Constitutional \\nLimitations 665 (7th ed. 1903). Put another way: \\nreligious freedom, as understood by the Founders, \\nnecessarily encompasses the freedom to put belief \\ninto action, to engage in expression consistent with \\nthe dogmas of your faith, and to refrain from \\nexpression that may engender extratemporal consequences. \\nII. T\\nHIS COURT \\u2019S PRECEDENTS \\u2014ESPECIALLY ITS \\nDEMANDING APPLICATION OF THE LEAST -\\nRESTRICTIVE MEANS TEST \\u2014DEMONSTRATE \\nAGREEMENT WITH THE FOUNDING GENERATION \\u2019S \\nROBUST RELIGIOUS LIBERTY PROTECTIONS . \\nThis Court has a commendable history of \\nrecognizing the principles discussed above. In \\nparticular, the Court\\u2019s recent religious liberty \\njurisprudence has been a welcome reprieve for \\nmembers of all faith communities who have been disheartened by the antagonism of some government \\nactors. See,  e.g., Espinoza v. Mont. Dept of Revenue , \\n140 S. Ct. 2246 (2020); Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. \\nColo. Civil Rights Comm\\u2019n , 138 S. Ct. 1719 (2018); \\nHosanna-Tabor , 565 U.S. 171. \\n 21\\nOf particular note is the Court\\u2019s insistence on a \\nforceful application of the strict scrutiny test to any \\nrestriction that burdens religious liberty. Indeed, \\u201cin \\nthis highly sensitive constitutional area, \\u2018only the \\ngravest abuses, endangering paramount interests, \\ngive occasion for permissible limitation.\\u2019\\u201d Sherbert v. \\nVerner , 374 U.S. 398, 406 (1963) (quoting Thomas v. \\nCollins, 323 U.S. 516, 530 (1945)). \\n1. A few examples illustrate the point. Consider \\nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. , where this \\nCourt considered a government-imposed contraceptive mandate on private employers who \\nbelieved such a requirement to be against their \\nreligious beliefs. 573 U.S. 682, 726 (2014).\\n4 While \\nassuming, without deciding, that the government\\u2019s \\ninterest was compelling, the Court nonetheless found \\nthat the least-restrictive-means standard was not \\nmet. Id., at 728. Identifying alternative solutions to \\nthe rigid mandate imposed by the government, the Court explained, \\u201c[t]he least-restrictive-means \\nstandard is exceptionally demanding.\\u201d Id.  As Justice \\nKennedy explained, religious freedom \\u201cimplicates more than just freedom of belief\\u201d; rather \\u201c[i]t means, too, the right to express those beliefs and to establish \\none\\u2019s religious (or nonreligious) self-definition in the \\npolitical, civic, and econ omic life of our larger \\n                                           \\n4 Hobby Lobby  was decided under the Religious Freedom \\nRestoration Act of 1993 (\\u201cRFRA\\u201d), which requires as an initial \\nmatter finding a substantial government burden on the exercise of religion; if such a burden exists, the Court must determine \\nwhether there is a compelling governmental interest and that \\nthe burden is the least restrictive means of furthering that \\ninterest. Hobby Lobby , 573 U.S., at 694-95. \\n 22\\ncommunity.\\u201d Id., at 736\\u201337 (Kennedy, J., \\nconcurring). \\nIn another instance, this Court found Missouri \\nviolated a church\\u2019s religious  liberty guarantees under \\nthe First Amendment when it categorically denied \\ntheir participation in a grant program for playground \\nsurface materials. Trinity Lutheran Church of \\nColumbia, Inc. v. Comer , 137 S. Ct. 2012, 2017, 2025 \\n(2017). Finding that otherwise eligible grant \\nrecipients were disqualified solely because of their \\nreligious nature, this Court held that such a penalty \\nworked against the free exercise of religion and \\u201ctriggers the most exacting scrutiny.\\u201d Id., at 2021. \\nImportantly, the harm was not the denial of the grant itself but instead was Missouri\\u2019s refusal to \\neven allow the church to compete with secular \\norganizations for grant funds solely on the basis of \\nits religious identity. Id., at 2022. \\nMore recently still, this Court took up the mantle \\nof religious liberties in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia . \\nDespite the Catholic Church\\u2019s over two centuries of dedication to serving the needy children of \\nPhiladelphia, the City in 2018 stopped referring foster children to the Catholic Social Services (\\u201cCSS\\u201d) \\nafter learning the organization would not \\u201cconsider \\nprospective foster parents in same-sex marriages.\\u201d \\nFulton , 141 S. Ct., at 1874\\u201375. Finding that \\u201cit is \\nplain\\u201d the City burdens CSS\\u2019s \\u201creligious exercise by putting it to the choice of  curtailing its mission or \\napproving relationships inconsistent with its beliefs,\\u201d this Court sought a review of whether such burden \\nwas \\u201cconstitutionally permissible.\\u201d Id., at 1876. In \\ndetermining that Philadelphia imposed an unconstitutional burden on CSS\\u2019s religious exercise, \\n 23\\nFulton  admonishes that \\u201cso lo ng as the government \\ncan achieve its interests in a manner that does not \\nburden religion, it must do so.\\u201d Id., at 1881. \\nTaken together, the precedents of this Court \\nestablish that an exacting analysis is required in \\nreligious liberty cases to determine whether the \\ngovernment\\u2019s interest is compelling, and its burden \\nnarrowly tailored to achieve that interest. The \\nexistence of an alternative means for achieving even \\na compelling interest is nearly always fatal to the government\\u2019s argument.  \\n2. When religious liberty and free expression \\nconcerns intertwine, this Court has been even less \\nhesitant to invalidate an infringing law. This \\nskepticism is warranted, as attempts to compel \\nexpression that conflicts with an individual\\u2019s \\nreligious beliefs are nothing more than indirect \\nattempts to regulate religion itself. \\nIn 1943, this Court took issue with a West \\nVirginia law mandating a flag salute and pledge, when its application was challenged by a group of \\nJehovah\\u2019s Witnesses who said such action violated \\ntheir religious beliefs. W. Va. State Bd. Of Educ. V. \\nBarnette , 319 U.S. 624 (1943). Refusing to find that \\n\\u201ca Bill of Rights which guards the individual\\u2019s right \\nto speak his own mind, left it open to public \\nauthorities to compel him to utter what is not on his \\nmind,\\u201d the Barnette  Court blocked the law\\u2019s \\nenforcement. Id. , at 634; see also  id., at 645 (Murphy, \\nJ., concurring) (recognizing \\u201c[t]he right of freedom of thought and of religion as guaranteed by the \\nConstitution against State action includes both the \\nright to speak freely and the right to refrain from \\n 24\\nspeaking at all\\u201d). Underlying the Court\\u2019s opinion was \\nthe belief that \\u201c[i]f there is any fixed star in our \\nconstitutional constellation, it is that no official, high \\nor petty, can prescribe what  shall be orthodox in \\npolitics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act \\ntheir faith therein.\\u201d Id., at 642. \\nExpanding on the holding in Barnette , the Court \\nin Wooley v. Maynard  considered a religious \\nobjection to display of the New Hampshire state motto\\u2014\\u201cLive Free or Die\\u201d\\u2014on the license plate of a \\ncar owned by Jehovah\\u2019s Witness. 430 U.S. 705 (1977). In Wooley , the Court expressly rejected the \\nidea that \\u201cthe State may constitutionally require an individual to participate in the dissemination of an \\nideological message by displaying it on his private \\nproperty.\\u201d Id., at 713. \\nFoundational to its decision was the Court\\u2019s \\nholding that the freedoms contained within the First \\nAmendment \\u201cincludes both the right to speak freely \\nand the right to refrain from speaking at all.\\u201d Id., at \\n714. It matters not whether most agree with the message the State seeks to force a person to convey; the First Amendment unquestionably \\u201cprotects the \\nright of individuals to hold a point of view different \\nfrom the majority and to refu se to foster . . . an idea \\nthey find morally objectionable.\\u201d Id. , at 715. Finding \\nthe existence of a governmental burden, the Court \\nwas left to question whether a substantial \\ngovernmental interest existed and, if so, whether the \\nburden was narrowly tailored to advance that \\ninterest. Even assuming a legitimate and substantial interest, the Court concluded \\u201cthat purpose cannot \\nbe pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental \\n 25\\npersonal liberties when the end can be more \\nnarrowly achieved.\\u201d Id., at 716. New Hampshire \\nfailed that test. \\nIn still another line of cases, this Court found \\nthat it violated Constitutional protections to subject religious observants, who went door to door \\ndistributing religious materials and soliciting for the \\npurchase of religious books, to a government \\nsolicitation registration requirement. Murdock v. \\nPennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105 (1943); see also Follett v. \\nTown of McCormick , 321 U.S. 573 (1944). \\nAcknowledging that the practice was derived from the believer\\u2019s understanding that he was \\u201cobeying a \\ncommandment of God,\\u201d the Court found that the First Amendment prohibited the imposition of a \\ngenerally applicable registration requirement to \\nengage in such conduct. Murdock , 319 U.S., at 108, \\n117. Indeed, the Court went out of its way to describe the literature being distributed as \\u201cprovocative, \\nabusive, and ill-mannered.\\u201d Id., at 115\\u201316. \\nNevertheless, \\u201c[p]lainly  a community may not \\nsuppress . . . the dissemination of views because they \\nare unpopular, annoying or distasteful.\\u201d Id.,  at 116 \\nTo allow otherwise would \\u201cbe a complete repudiation of the philosophy of the Bill of Rights.\\u201d Id. \\nThe Court went further still , establishing that the \\nmere fact the religious materials were being \\u201csold\\u201d was not enough to transform \\u201cevangelism into a \\ncommercial enterprise.\\u201d Id., at 111. As such, the \\nCourt acknowledged heightened constitutional protections for \\u201cthose spreading their religious \\nbeliefs through the spoken and printed word.\\u201d Id. As \\ncompared to purely commercial activity, \\u201c[f]reedom of \\n 26\\npress, freedom of speech, fr eedom of religion are in a \\npreferred position.\\u201d Id., at 115. \\nEven Employment Division v. Smith , often \\ncriticized as having watered down constitutional \\nreligious liberty protections, recognized the Court\\u2019s \\nunique hostility toward burdens that implicate both \\nthe free exercise of religion and the freedom of \\nspeech. The \\u201cFirst Amendment bars application of a \\nneutral, generally applicable law to religiously \\nmotivated action\\u201d when that action \\u201cinvolve[s] not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but the Free \\nExercise Clause in conjunction with other \\nconstitutional protections, such as freedom of \\nspeech.\\u201d Empl. Div. v. Smith , 494 U.S. 872, 881\\u201382 \\n(1990). Even some preceden ts, decided on free speech \\ngrounds alone, were undoubtedly reinforced by \\ntouches of freedom-of-religion concerns. Id. \\n3. This much is clear: the arc of this Court\\u2019s \\nprecedent bends in one incontrovertible direction. \\nScrutiny of any government burden is at its zenith \\nwhen the burden effects an individual\\u2019s exercise of their religious beliefs in a manner that implicates \\nfree speech protections. This conclusion, rooted in the \\nhistory and tradition of religious exercise as \\nunderstood by the Founders and enshrined in the \\nFirst Amendment, demands that any such burden be \\nsubjected to the most rigorous application of strict \\nscrutiny analysis. \\nIt is precisely for this reason that, to the best of \\nAmicus Curiae\\u2019s knowledge, the Court has never \\nissued an opinion finding that governmentally \\ncompelled religious speech satisfies strict scrutiny. \\nSee 303 Creative Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Elenis , 6 F.4th \\n 27\\n1160, 1191 (U.S. 10th Cir. 2021) (Tymkovich, C.J., \\ndissenting) (\\u201c[T]he majority takes the remarkable\\u2014\\nand novel\\u2014stance that the government may force \\nMs. Smith to produce messages that violate her \\nconscience. . . . No case has ever gone so far.\\u201d). \\nThis case should not be the first. \\nIII. THE TENTH CIRCUIT \\u2019S OPINION CANNOT BE \\nSQUARED EITHER WITH THE FIRST \\nAMENDMENT \\u2019S RICH HISTORY OR THIS COURT \\u2019S \\nPROTECTION OF BELIEVERS \\u2019 FREE SPEECH \\nRIGHTS . \\nIn its permissive application of strict scrutiny, the \\nTenth Circuit bastardized this Court\\u2019s protection of free speech rights, especially as applied to religious \\nexpression. If allowed to stand, its precedent will give license to courts across this Country to \\nhumiliate members of all religious sects by \\ncompelling them to speak in contravention of their \\nsincerely held religious beliefs. By purporting to \\napply strict scrutiny, the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s opinion \\ncheapened the First Amendment rights of Catholics, \\nProtestants, Muslims, Jews, and all other believers alike. \\nLuckily, this precedent d oes not need to stand. \\nThis Court, once again, has an opportunity to \\nadmonish that the free speech protections of \\nbelievers are no less than non-believers and, in fact, \\nare heightened when faced with government \\nregulation that would compel speech antithetical to the tenants of a believer\\u2019s faith. The First \\nAmendment commands such a result. \\n 28\\nAlthough the Tenth Circuit rightly concluded that \\nMs. Smith\\u2019s website designs are \\u201cpure speech,\\u201d 303 \\nCreative LLC, 6 F.4th, at 1176, the Tenth Circuit \\nwrongly concludes that the commercial nature of Ms. \\nSmith\\u2019s speech gives Colorado a regulatory hook to \\nlatch onto. Id., at 1179. By failing to acknowledge the \\nreligious nature of her objection to the would-be compelled speech, the Tenth Circuit did not afford \\nher First Amendment rights the \\u201cpreferred\\u201d status \\nthey deserve.\\n5 Cf., Murdock , 319 U.S., at 115. What \\nis remarkable is that the religious nature of Ms. Smith\\u2019s objection is not disputed. See 303 \\nCreative, 6 F. 4th, at 1172 (Ms. Smith is \\u201cwilling to create custom graphics and websites for gay, lesbian, \\nor bisexual clients . . . so long as the custom graphics \\nand websites do not violate [her] religious beliefs, as is true for all customers.\\u201d (internal quotation marks \\nomitted)); id., at 1192 (Tymkovich, C.J., dissenting) \\n(\\u201cIn short, Colorado appear s to agree that Ms. Smith \\ndoes not distinguish between customers based on \\nprotected-class status and thus advances the aims of \\nCADA. But when any customer asks Ms. Smith to \\ncreate expressive content that violates her sincerely \\nheld beliefs, she will decline the request.\\u201d). \\n                                           \\n5 Remarkably, the Tenth Circuit  suggests that its sweeping \\nholding may not apply to \\u201call artists\\u201d if they were not engaged \\nin \\u201ccommercial activity,\\u201d but rather \\u201ccommissioning a mural for some charitable purpose.\\u201d 303 Creative , 6 F.4th, at 1182, n.6. To \\nsuggest that a local artist wh o refuses to paint a Christian \\nmural for a church may enjoy more constitutional protections \\nthan a woman called to live out her sincerely held religious \\nbeliefs by creating custom wedding websites is, thankfully, not supported by the history or tradition of the First Amendment \\nand the muscular protections it affords religious believers. \\n 29\\nThis failure is compounded by the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s \\nfallacy of a marketplace of one for Ms. Smith\\u2019s \\nspeech. Id. at 1180. Such convenient analysis \\nallowed the court to conclude \\u201cthere are no less intrusive means of providing equal access to those  \\ntypes of services.\\u201d Id. (emphasis added). But this \\nclever reasoning flips this Court\\u2019s precedent on its \\nhead. Rather than prioritize the religious speaker\\u2019s \\nobjection in search of a less restrictive means, the \\ncourt below merely concluded that she is the only one and therefore no other means will suffice. But, \\nwhere, as here, the government can achieve its interests without burdening religion, the \\nConstitution requires it to do so. Fulton , 141 S. Ct., \\nat 1881. The analysis is also anomalous in the free speech context because it cannot be that the more \\nunique and distinctive the speech, the less  First \\nAmendment protection it deserves. But that is the staggering breadth of the Tenth Circuit majority\\u2019s \\nconclusion. See 303 Creative , 6 F.4th, at 1204-05 \\n(Tymkovich, C.J., dissenting).  \\nMoreover, by categorizing Ms. Smith as nothing \\nmore than a \\u201cpublic accommodation,\\u201d the Tenth \\nCircuit minimized her right to participate in the \\nmarketplace, even as a woman of faith. See 303 \\nCreative, 6 F.4th, at 1181 (\\u201c[W]hether an exception limits market access depends upon the uniqueness of \\nthe public accommodation\\u2019s goods and services\\u2014not \\nthe sincerity of the public accommodation\\u2019s beliefs.\\u201d). \\nTo deny a benefit to those \\u201cwho engage in certain \\nforms of speech is in effect to penalize them for such \\nspeech,\\u201d and constitutionally, no different than \\nconditioning a benefit on a person\\u2019s \\u201cwillingness to \\nviolate a cardinal principle of her religious faith;\\u201d the \\n 30\\nresult is the same: to \\u201cdeter[] or discourage[] the \\nexercise of First Amendment rights of expression.\\u201d \\nSherbert , 374 U.S., at 405-06 (citing Speiser v. \\nRandall, 357 U.S. 513, 518 (1958)). Here too, Colorado seeks to impose the same constitutional \\nharm: speak in violation of your core religious faith \\nor lose the benefit of marketplace participation. Put \\nsimply, Colorado seeks to punish Ms. Smith for her \\nsincerely held religious beliefs. See also Trinity \\nLutheran Church , 137 S. Ct., at 2021\\u201322 (finding a \\nconstitutional violation where a burden puts \\nreligious believers \\u201cto a choice: [] participate in an \\notherwise available benefit\\u201d or maintain your \\nreligious identity). \\nThe same fundamental principle must apply to \\nfree speech and religious practices when they act in concert: \\u201cIn an open, pluralistic, self-governing \\nsociety, the expression of an idea cannot be \\nsuppressed simply because some find it offensive, \\ninsulting, or even wounding.\\u201d Fulton , 141 S. Ct., at \\n1924-25 (Alito, J., concurring). To lose this principle is to lose the \\u201cpreservation of religious freedom.\\u201d Id., \\nat 1925. That is because \\u201c[s]uppressing speech\\u2014or \\nreligious practice\\u2014simply because it expresses an idea that some find hurtful is a zero-sum game.\\u201d Id. \\nThis Court\\u2019s jurisprudence confirms this link \\nbetween religious exercise and free speech because \\nthis Court\\u2019s opinions \\u201cmake it perfectly clear that \\ndiscrimination against religious, as opposed to \\nsecular, expression is viewpoint discrimination.\\u201d \\nNurre v. Whitehead , 559 U.S. 1025, 1028 (2010) \\n(Alito, J., dissenting). And because viewpoint discrimination is \\u201can egregious form of content \\ndiscrimination,\\u201d Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of \\n 31\\nthe Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995), it brings \\nwith it heightened constitutional skepticism. \\nAlthough some may find Ms. Smith\\u2019s religious \\nbeliefs objectionable, \\u201creligions, and those who \\nadhere to religious doctrines, may continue to \\nadvocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by \\ndivine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be \\ncondoned.\\u201d Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U.S. 644, 679 \\n(2015). \\u201cAn open society can keep that promise while still respecting the \\u2018dignity,\\u2019 \\u2018worth,\\u2019 and fundamental equality of all members of the \\ncommunity.\\u201d Fulton , 141 S. Ct., at 1925 (Alito, J., \\nconcurring) (quoting Masterpiece Cakeshop , 138 S. \\nCt., at 1727). Ms. Smith should be free to practice all \\naspects of her faith, without fear of government-\\ncompelled expression against her sincerely held \\nreligious beliefs. The Constitution demands no less. \\nCONCLUSION \\n \\n\\u201c[T]here is before us the right of freedom to \\nbelieve, freedom to worship one\\u2019s Maker according to the dictates of one\\u2019s conscience, a right which the \\nConstitution specifically shelters.\\u201d Barnette , 319 \\nU.S., at 645 (Murphy, J., concurring). For this Court, there is \\u201cno loftier duty or responsibility than to \\nuphold that spiritual freedom to its farthest \\nreaches.\\u201d Id. \\nTo exclude Ms. Smith from offering her services\\u2014\\nsolely on the basis of her religious identity\\u2014would be \\n\\u201codious to our Constitution.\\u201d Trinity Lutheran \\nChurch , 137 S.

As part of that project, EPA has obtained emails and handwritten and typewritten notes under public records requests, which records on their face confess to the driving factor behind this liti-gation and similar litigation and inform the inquiry into federal versus state jurisdiction in this booming class of \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation filed in state courts. These records EPA obtained prompted it to file its first amicus  brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for \\nthe First Circuit, where removal of another among the growing number of \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d lawsuits filed \\nby governmental entities seeking billions of dollars \\nfrom private parties is pending.\\n2 That brief revealed \\ntwo sets of notes each purporting, independently, to record the assertion by an official with the governmen-tal plaintiff in that case, the State of Rhode Island, that the litigation seeks to obtain a \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d to underwrite that State\\u2019s spending ambitions, \\n \\n 1 Pursuant to Rule 37.6, counsel for Amicus  certifies that no \\ncounsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in part and that no person or entity other than Amici  or their counsel made a \\nmonetary contribution intended to fund the brief \\u2019s preparation or submission.

Leave for EPA to file as amicus \\ncuriae  granted on March 26, 2020 \\n2 \\n after the State\\u2019s legislature declined to provide the de-\\nsired funds. Rhode Island\\u2019s confession was made at a meeting attended by \\u201ccabinet\\u201d-level representatives of numerous state governments from across the nation, including a representative from Maryland, and empha-sized the desire to pr oceed in state courts.\\n3 In that First \\nCircuit litigation, numerous  parties rely upon the \\nFourth Circuit\\u2019s decision in  the instant matter, and par-\\nties to the First Circuit litigation ad dressed the Fourth \\nCircuit\\u2019s opinion below in let ters of supplemental au-\\nthority pursuant to Fed. R. Ap p. Pro. 28(j). Because EPA \\nhas obtained records confe ssing the rationale behind \\nthe veritable tsunami of state-court \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d lawsuits such as the one now before this Court, and af-firming the plaintiffs\\u2019 emp hasis among peers and other \\npotential governmental plaint iff-recruits on using state \\ncourts for these actions with  national p olicy implica-\\ntions and avoiding the federal court system, EPA is keenly interested in this case and asks this Court to \\ngrant certiorari to address th e proper relationship be-\\ntween the state and federal court systems. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\n As important as climate policy is to both state and \\nfederal governments, equally and arguably more im-portant is the principle that the courts\\u2019 role is not to \\nmake policy judgments. This Court held in American \\nElectric Power v. Connecticut , 131 S. Ct. 2527, 2539, \\n \\n 3 A full list of attendees prepared by the organizers and ob-\\ntained under Colorado law is ava ilable at https://govoversight.org/ \\nwp-content/uploads/2020/01/Fulsome-list-of-participants.png. \\n3 \\n 564 U.S. 410, 426 (2011) that \\u201cthe federal courts would \\nhave no warrant to employ the federal common law of nuisance to upset\\u201d federal primacy in climate regula-tory policy. But rather than heed the American Electric \\nPower  opinion\\u2019s warnings that federal policy decisions \\nare to be made by Congress or by federal agencies ex-ercising properly delegated authority, certain litigants have instead attempted to end run that holding by seeking to create policy in state, rather than federal, courts. While federal courts ar e courts of limited juris-\\ndiction, in this matter the de cision below is based upon \\na series of cases that have eviscerated the jurisdiction of federal courts, even when important federal inter-ests are at stake. This is in conflict with the decisions of other Circuits, congressional action taken since these \\nFourth Circuit precedents were  adopted, and this Court\\u2019s \\nown rulings. Allowing the opin ion below to stand will \\ncause mischief in state courts across the nation. Re-cently obtained public records provide strong impetus to acknowledge, as a formal matter, that this \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation campaign is an impermissible use of the state courts, just as this Court previously held it \\nwas an impermissible use of the federal courts. This Court should prevent litigants from seeking the most favorable forum to obtain p olitical and policy ends by \\njudicial means. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\n  \\n4 \\n ARGUMENT \\nI. THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\\u2019S DECISION CON-\\nTRADICTS RECENT JURISPRUDENCE \\nAND LEGISLATION. THIS COURT SHOULD \\nGRANT CERTIORARI TO ENFORCE ITS OWN PRECEDENTS AND CONGRESSIONAL INTENT \\n The decision below, designated for publication and \\nwith the potential to shape or confuse the law for years \\nto come, is based on a series of precedents unique to the Fourth Circuit, many of which contradict more re-\\ncent holdings of this Court and even statutory changes \\nenacted by Congress. The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s reliance on its own, idiosyncratic precedents led to a result that is \\nin conflict with the holdings  of numerous other courts \\nand which will, if allowed to stand, result in mischief across the nation. \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision below, while pub-\\nlished only this year, has its foundations in a holding \\nfrom the 1970s that has been  adrift in changing legal \\nseas since then, and was implicitly swamped by a hold-ing of this Court twenty years ago. That Fourth Circuit \\nopinion, Noel v. McCain , 538 F.2d 633 (4th Cir. 1976), \\nheld that remand orders are essentially unreviewable unless they raise very narrow statutory grounds. Stare \\ndecisis  is an important legal principle, but in this case \\nthe Fourth Circuit\\u2019s adherence to its own precedents rather than those of this Court was misplaced. \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision below acknowledges \\nthat this Court subsequently interpreted the same \\n5 \\n statutory language differently in Yamaha Motor Corp., \\nU.S.A. v. Calhoun , 516 U.S. 199 (1996). More recently, \\nthe Seventh Circuit reached a contrary conclusion \\nabout the reviewability of di strict court orders to re-\\nmand in Lu Junhong v. Boeing Co. , 792 F.3d 805, 810\\u2013\\n13 (7th Cir. 2015). Even assuming, arguendo , that the \\nFourth Circuit properly decided the Noel  case in 1976, \\ncontinued reliance on Noel  is no longer appropriate. \\n It isn\\u2019t just precedent t hat has changed since the \\nFourth Circuit issued its opinion in Noel . Relevant \\nstatutory law has also changed: the Removal Clarifica-\\ntion Act of 2011, Pub. L. No. 112-51, 125 Stat. 545, clar-ified Congressional intent for federal courts to \\u201cclarify \\nand improve certain provisions relating to the removal \\nof litigation against Federal officers or agencies to Fed-\\neral courts.\\u201d \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision below (hereinafter \\n\\u201cBaltimore \\u201d), is based on foundations that Congress, \\nother federal courts, and this Court have steadily \\neroded since the Fourth Circu it issued the authority on \\nwhich Baltimore  rests. This Court, the Seventh Circuit, \\nand Congress itself have all spoken more recently. The \\ninnovative legal theories brought by the Plaintiffs in this case further highlight the need to decide the mat-\\nter based on current law. This Court should take the \\nopportunity to apply the Removal Clarification Act and resolve the split in the circuits that the Baltimore  opin-\\nion below aggravates. \\n \\n6 \\n II. IF THE DECISION BELOW STANDS, FED-\\nERAL COURTS WILL BE UNABLE TO PRE-\\nVENT FEDERAL POLICIES FROM BEING UNDERMINED AT THE STATE LEVEL \\n This suit is but one of many similar suits being \\nfiled all over the country. More than a dozen U.S. cit-\\nies, states and counties including the State of Rhode Island, City and County of Boulder (CO), City and \\nCounty of Honolulu (HI), City of New York (NY), \\nMarin, San Mateo and Santa Cruz Counties (CA), the cities of Imperial Beach, Oakland, Richmond, San \\nFrancisco, San Mateo, and Santa Cruz (CA), and King \\nCounty (WA), among others have filed similar claims against similar and generally the same defendants al-\\nleging similar causes of action which allegedly arise \\nunder state law. As at least one court has previously noted, multi-front litigation raises important concerns \\nabout the motivations of litigants. Chevron Corp. v. \\nDonziger , 974 F.Supp.2d 362, 475 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (\\u201cThe \\npoint of the multi-front strategy thus was to leverage \\nthe expense, risks, and bu rden to [defendant] of de-\\nfending itself in multiple jurisdictions to achieve a swift recovery, most likely by precipitating a settle-\\nment.\\u201d), later upheld at Chevron Corp. v. Donziger , 833 \\nF.3d 74 (2d Cir. 2016), cert. denied  at 137 S. Ct. 2268 \\n(2017). \\n This explosion in such cases filed in state court \\nseeks many hundreds of billions of dollars from private \\nparties, and seeks to enlist the defendants as advo-\\ncates in pressing for the plai ntiffs\\u2019 and their partners\\u2019 \\ndesired federal policies. Records obtained by Amicus  \\n7 \\n also show the attempt to us e the litigation to obtain \\ngovernmental revenues after that failed through the \\nappropriate, political process (see, infra ). Affirming the \\nimpropriety of this use of the courts as well as the ar-dent campaign by state and municipal plaintiffs to \\nkeep the matters away from the federal court and ex-\\nclusively before state courts, EPA has obtained emails and handwritten and typewritten notes under public \\nrecords requests, further discussed below, that illus-\\ntrate the danger of allowing st ate courts to interfere in \\nthis way in lawful interstate commerce conducted un-\\nder the auspices of the federal government. Key among \\nthese public records are two sets of notes each purport-ing, independently, to record the assertion by a senior \\nState of Rhode Island official that the objective of its \\nlitigation was to obtain a \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d for the State\\u2019s spending ambitions, in the face of a leg-\\nislature that does not share the executive\\u2019s priorities. \\n Both sets of notes record that official as emphasiz-\\ning the use of state courts to  obtain this funding denied \\nthem by the legislature. Other records, also noted, in-\\nfra, record the plaintiff \\u2019s legal counsel\\u2019s team, at least \\nsome of whom also represent the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore in this litigation,\\n4 lobbying gov-\\nernmental officials to join the campaign emphasizing the strategy of advancing this cause in the \\u201cmore ad-vantageous venue for these cases,\\u201d which plaintiffs confess is to be had in state courts. \\n \\n 4 The California law firm Sher Edling LLP represents both \\nthe State of Rhode Island in the First Circuit and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore in the Fourth Circuit. \\n8 \\n  These public records obtained through state open \\nrecords laws by Amicus  EPA represent a Rhode Island \\n\\u201ccabinet\\u201d-level official confiding to peers that the \\nState\\u2019s elected representatives are insufficiently moved by the plaintiff \\u2019s requests to enact laws raising \\nthe revenues the State\\u2019s executive desires; and that it \\nis thus \\u201clooking for [a] sustainable funding stream,\\u201d having been reduced to \\u201csuing big oil\\u201d for its \\u201cPriority \\n\\u2013 sustainable funding stream .\\u201d Notably, both sets of \\nnotes capture the State of Rhode Island as having em-phasized the \\u201cstate court\\u201d aspect of its plan. \\n These records, representing a similarly-situated \\nplaintiff \\u2019s confession, as recorded identically by two by \\nothers in the comfort of a presumably candid and off-\\nthe-record private meeting with peers and funders of \\u201cclimate\\u201d activism, leave little doubt that this growing \\nwave of state court \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation seeks \\nat least two impermissible objectives. First, this type of litigation seeks to use (state) courts to effectively \\ncreate federal energy and environmental policy. Sec-\\nond, in addition to using litigation as a stand-in for \\nthe political process that has denied state and munic-\\nipal plaintiffs their desired policies, it seeks to use lit-\\nigation to raise revenues having be en denied them \\nwhere revenues would properly be raised, which \\nagain is by the po litical process. \\n These public records provide strong impetus to \\nacknowledge, as a formal matter, that this \\u201cclimate \\nnuisance\\u201d litigation campaign is an impermissible use of the courts, seeking the most favorable forum to ob-\\ntain political ends by judicial means; that when filed \\n9 \\n they must remain in federal court; and that they \\nshould be dismissed for the same reasons. \\n \\nIII. PUBLIC RECORDS OBTAINED BY PRO-\\nPOSED AMICUS CURIAE  AFFIRM THIS \\nCASE BELONGS IN FEDERAL COURT \\n Amicus  EPA has obtained public records from Col-\\norado State University\\u2019s Center for a New Energy Economy (\\u201cCNEE\\u201d) under the Colorado Open Records \\nAct (\\u201cCORA\\u201d). Those records have now been brought to \\nthe attention of the First Circuit in related litigation, and are proper subject for judic ial notice by this Court. \\nSee Fed. Rule Evid. 201(b)(2). The records pertain to a \\ntwo-day meeting in July 2019 hosted by the Rockefel-ler Brothers Fund (\\u201cRBF\\u201d) at the Rockefeller family \\nmansion at Pocantico, NY. They include numerous \\nemails, agendas and other materials. Most pertinent, they also include a set of handwritten notes and a sec-\\nond, corroborating set of typewritten notes. According \\nto the public records themselves, the former was pre-pared by attendee Carla Frisch of the Rocky Mountain \\nInstitute (\\u201cRMI\\u201d), and the latter by attendee Katie \\nMcCormack of the Energy Foundation.\\n5 \\n \\n 5 These are available, respectively, at https://climatelitigationwatch. \\norg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Carla-Frisch-handwritten-notes- EPA_CORA1505.pdf and https:// climatelitigationwatch.org/ \\nwp-content/uploads/2020/03/EF-Katie-McCormack-typed-notes-EPA_CORA1542.pdf. These documents are identified in an August \\n20, 2019 email from CNEE\\u2019s Patric k Cummins transmitting them \\nto RBF\\u2019s Michael Northrop, Subject: meeting highlights, available at https://climatelitigationwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ \\n \\n10 \\n  This was a private event, styled \\u201cAccelerating \\nState Action on Climate Change,\\u201d if hosted as a forum \\nfor policy activists and a major funder to coordinate \\nwith senior public employees, e.g., a governor\\u2019s chief of staff and department secretaries and their cabinet \\nequivalents from fifteen states. These states included \\nFirst Circuit Plaintiff the State of Rhode Island, repre-sented by its Director of the Department of Environ-\\nmental Management, Janet Coit.\\n6 \\n These notes purport to contemporaneously record \\nthe comments of Director Coit discussing Rhode Is-\\nland\\u2019s entry in this litigation campaign, among peers. One passage in each set of no tes, attributed to Director \\nCoit and replicated almost verbatim in both, is partic-\\nularly striking and relevant, affirming two points that have become obvious and which should inform key de-\\ncisions confronting the judiciary in this \\u201cclimate nui-\\nsance\\u201d litigation campaign. \\n The records show RMI\\u2019s Frisch recorded Director \\nCoit speaking to this litigation as shown in the below \\n \\nEdited-notes-transmittal-email-CSU-suggests-Snail-mail-probably- \\ncovered-EPA_CORA1481_Redacted.pdf. \\u201cRBF CNEE climate pol-icy notes Jul 17 18.docx\\u201d are Katie McCormack\\u2019s notes (Energy Foundation); these appear to be produced as document EPA_ CORA1542.pdf, derived from Ms. McCormick\\u2019s transmittal email \\nbeing 1541, in which she describes her notes as long, and 1542 consists of 18 pages of notes;  \\u201cXerox Scan_07222019155622.pdf \\u201d \\nare Carla Frisch\\u2019s handwritten notes (this was produced as docu-ment EPA_CORA1505.pdf ). \\n \\n6 The participant list is availabl e at https://climatelitigation-\\nwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/List-of-Attendees-EPA_ CORA1037.pdf. \\n11 \\n excerpted image (Ms. Frisch\\u2019s notes are available in \\nfull at https://climatelitigationwatch.org/wp-content/ \\nuploads/2020/03/Carla-Frisch-handwritten-notes-EPA_ \\nCORA1505.pdf ). Ms. Frisch recorded Director Coit as saying, about this suit: \\nRI \\u2013 Gen Assembly D but doesn\\u2019t care on env/climate \\nlooking for sustainable funding stream \\nsuing big oil for RI damages in state court \\n \\n The first line-item attributes to Director Coit the \\nposition that the Rhode Island legislature is not per-suaded of the claims set fort h by the State in its litiga-\\ntion. This reluctance to politically impose the revenue-\\nraising measures (taxes) necessary for such funding streams is inherently shared among all \\u201cclimate nui-\\nsance\\u201d plaintiffs. The excerp t appears to also reflect \\nDirector Coit\\u2019s view of why the Rhode Island legisla-ture has thereby declined to obtain from the taxpayer, \\n\\n12 \\n and then appropriate to the State, the revenue streams \\nthat governmental Plaintiff Rhode Island desires. \\n This entry on its face represents a senior official \\nconfessing that Rhode Island\\u2019s climate litigation, es-\\nsentially identical to that in the Baltimore case below, \\nis in fact a product of Rhode Island\\u2019s elected represent-atives lacking enthusiasm for politically enacting cer-\\ntain policies, including reve nue measures, thus leaving \\nthe state \\u201clooking for [a] sustainable funding stream,\\u201d and so \\u201csuing big oil.\\u201d This characterizes all such gov-\\nernmental plaintiffs and su its including the matter \\nin the Fourth Circuit case which is the subject of the \\nPetition in this matter. \\n Fortunately, we can be confident that Ms. Frisch \\ndid not mishear Director Coit. The Energy Foundation\\u2019s \\nKatie McCormack provided RBF with a typewritten \\nset of her own notes transcribing the proceedings. To this Court\\u2019s further benefit, Ms. McCormack\\u2019s type-\\nwritten transcription of Director Coit\\u2019s commentary \\nreads almost verbatim as Ms. Frisch\\u2019s. \\n Ms. McCormack recorded Di rector Coit as saying: \\n* Assembly very conservative leadership \\u2013 don\\u2019t \\ncare about env\\u2019t \\n* If care, put it in the budget \\n* Priority \\u2013 sustainable funding stream * State court against oil/gas \\n13 \\n  \\n These notes on their face both affirm two realities \\nthat have become inescapable in recent years about this epidemic of \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation, all chan-neled into state courts (aft er the first generation of \\nsuits floundered in federal co urt, and ultimately were \\nterminated by this Court in American Electric Power v. \\nConnecticut , 131 S. Ct. 2527, 2539, 564 U.S. 410, 426 \\n(2011)).\\n7 That is that these suits seek to use the courts \\nto stand in for policymakers on two fronts. First, these suits ask the courts to substitute their authority for that of the political branches of government on matters of policy. Second, these suits seek billions of dollars in revenues, again the province of the political branches, for distribution toward political uses and constituen-cies. \\n O n  t h a t  fi r s t  c o u n t  o f  policymaking through the \\ncourts, the RBF meeting notes ratify a comment made to The Nation magazine by the plaintiffs\\u2019 tort lawyer credited with inventing this wave of litigation, Matt \\n \\n 7 See, e.g., Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp ., \\n663 F.Supp.2d 863 (N.D. Cal. 2009), upheld at  696 F.3d 849 (9th \\nCir. 2012). \\n\\n14 \\n Pawa. The magazine wrote, \\u201cAt the end of his speech, \\nSenator [Sheldon] Whitehouse [of Rhode Island] re-minded his colleagues of their \\u2018legislative responsibil-ity to address climate change.\\u2019 But it\\u2019s clear that too many lawmakers have abdicated, thus the pressure to tackle the climate issue thro ugh existing regulations \\nlike the Clean Air Act, and through the courts. \\u2018I\\u2019ve been hearing for twelve years or more that legislation is right around the corner that\\u2019s going to solve the global-warming problem, and that litigation is too long, difficult, and arduous a path,\\u2019 said Matthew Pawa, a climate attorney. \\u2018Legislation is going nowhere, so liti-gation could potentially play an important role.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n8 \\n Such use of the courts is of course improper but \\nalso informs a conclusion that these cases, when \\nbrought, belong in federal cour t, as well as that they \\nshould be dismissed for reasons including the inher-\\nently obvious, and now repeatedly confessed, purpose. \\n The second conclusion affirmed by these twice-\\nsourced assertions by the First Circuit plaintiffs is that \\nthis type of litigation is a grab for revenues, which again must properly be purs ued through the political \\nprocess. This is related to the first, in that, like policy, \\nsuch revenue-raising measures must be enacted by the voters\\u2019 elected representatives or approved directly by \\nvoters. Instead, with the desire for more \\u201cfunding \\nstreams\\u201d being yet another way the political process \\n \\n 8 Zoe Carpenter, The Government May Already Have the \\nLaw It Needs to Beat Big Oil , The Nation (July 15, 2015), \\nhttps://www.thenation.com/article/the-government-may-already-have-the-law-it-needs-to-beat-big-oil/. \\n15 \\n has failed such plaintiffs, we see them circumventing \\nthat process through this litigation campaign. \\n That the desire for more governmental revenue, \\nwithout adopting the necessa ry direct taxes for which \\nthere can be a political price to pay, was behind such \\nlitigation was suggested by the U.S. Chamber of Com-merce in a 2019 report enti tled \\u201cMitigating Munici-\\npality Litigation: Scope and Solutions,\\u201d published by \\nthe Chamber\\u2019s Institute fo r Legal Reform. That re-\\nport highlighted: \\n* \\u201cFor instance, local government leaders may \\neye the prospect of significant recoveries as a \\nmeans of making up for budget shortfalls.\\u201d \\n* \\u201cLarge settlements like those produced in the \\ntobacco litigation are alluring to municipali-\\nties facing budget constraints.\\u201d \\n* \\u201cSevere, persistent municipal budget con-\\nstraints have coincided with the rise of munic-ipal litigation agains t opioid manufacturers \\nas local governments are promised large re-\\ncoveries with no risk to municipal budgets by contingency fee trial lawyers.\\u201d \\n* \\u201cConclusion  A convergence of factors is propelling munici-\\npalities to file affirmative lawsuits against corporate entities. \\n There is the \\u2018push\\u2019 factor: municipalities face \\nhistoric budgetary cons traints and a public \\ninundated with news reports on the opioid cri-\\nsis, rising sea levels, and data breaches. And \\n16 \\n there is the \\u2018pull\\u2019 of potential multimillion-\\ndollar settlements and low-cost, contingency \\nfee trial lawyers. As a consequence, munici-\\npalities are pivoting to the courts by the thou-\\nsands.\\u201d9 \\n The National Association of Manufacturers\\u2019 Cen-\\nter for Legal Action has similarly argued that, \\u201cThe \\ntowns and lawyers have said that this litigation is \\nsolely about money. The towns want funding for local projects, and their lawyers are working on a contin-\\ngency fee basis, which means they aren\\u2019t paid if they \\ndon\\u2019t win.\\u201d\\n10 \\n The records EPA has obtained now provide docu-\\nmentary evidence to support these concerns that the courts are being exploited to balance municipal/state \\nbudgets and make policy decisions that legislators \\nhave declined to make. \\n \\n  \\n \\n 9 United States Chamber of Co mmerce, \\u201cMitigating Munici-\\npality Litigation: Scope and Solutions,\\u201d U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, March 2019, h ttps://www.instituteforlegalre-\\nform.com/uploads/sites/1/Mitigating-Municipality-Litigation-2019- Research.pdf, at p. 1, 6, 7 and 18, respectively. \\n \\n10 Manufacturers\\u2019 Accountability Project, \\u201cBeyond the Court-\\nroom: Climate Liability Litigation in the United States,\\u201d p. 2, https://mfgaccountabilityproject.or g/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ \\nMAP-Beyond-the-Courtroom-Chapter-One.pdf \\n17 \\n IV. HISTORIC CONCERNS ABOUT STATE \\nCOURT BIAS ARE AMPLIFIED IN CASES \\nOF THIS TYPE, SUCH THAT FEDERAL \\nCOURTS SHOULD STEP IN TO PROTECT \\nFEDERAL INTERESTS \\n A \\u201chistoric concern about state court bias\\u201d is the \\nunderlying basis allowing for federal officer removal. \\nSavoie v. Huntington Ingalls, Inc. , 817 F.3d 457, 461 \\n(5th Cir. 2016). The Supreme Court also recognizes bias as a concern justifying removal to federal court. \\n\\u201cState-court proceedings may reflect \\u2018local prejudice\\u2019 \\nagainst unpopular federal laws or federal officials.\\u201d Watson v. Philip Morris Cos. , 551 U.S. 142, 150 (2007). \\nBias exists, as these opinions acknowledge, and there \\nis no rational basis for declaring that such bias extends only to parties who are unpopular government offi-\\ncials. Indeed, this Court has  cautioned against \\u201cnarrow, \\ngrudging interpretation\\u201d of federal officer removal. Willingham v. Morgan , 395 U.S. 402, 407 (1969). \\nSimply put, \\u201c[t]he removal statute is an incident of fed-\\neral supremacy.\\u201d Murray v. Murray , 621 F.2d 103, 106 \\n(5th Cir. 1980). \\n States and municipalities are engaged in a cam-\\npaign through the courts to overturn \\u201cunpopular fed-\\neral laws.\\u201d Rather than recognizing the Constitution \\nand federal laws as supreme, governmental \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d plaintiffs are applying \\u201cnarrow, grudging\\u201d \\ninterpretation of the removal statute to seek to over-\\nturn federal law through imposing ostensible tort lia-bility in state courts. \\n18 \\n  It is hard to imagine a more striking case where \\nfear of state court bias could be a concern than is pre-\\nsented in the instant matter and similar cases unfold-\\ning across the nation. Stated otherwise and even more affirmatively, the hope  for state court bias is demon-\\nstrably at play in these case s, as shown in other records \\nobtained by Amicus  EPA through public records laws. \\n As documented, supra , by its own admission the \\nState of Rhode Island is pursuing its litigation to ob-tain a \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d for its officials\\u2019 \\nspending ambitions, having failed to convince the vot-\\ners\\u2019 elected representatives to provide one. Rhode Is-land\\u2019s circumstance in this respect differs not at all \\nfrom all such plaintiffs including in Baltimore . Both \\nsets of notes discussed, supra , specify Director Coit\\u2019s \\nemphasis on seeking this \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d \\nin \\u201cstate court.\\u201d All such plaintiffs are now moving \\nHeaven and earth to keep these matters out of the clutches of federal jurisdiction. \\n This objective of suing to make federal policy in \\nstate courts is a thematic cousin of the drive to use the \\ncourts when legislatures fail to enact plaintiffs\\u2019 desired \\npolicies, and is well-understood among the instant plaintiffs, Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, and by \\nthe legal teams for most similarly-situated govern-\\nment plaintiffs. That Rhode Island and the City of Bal-timore share not only claims and legal strategies but \\nlegal counsel, whose recruit ing team has emphasized \\nto targeted governmental entities the desire to keep these matters in state court as the \\u201cmore advantageous \\nvenue for these cases,\\u201d given this Court\\u2019s ruling in \\n19 \\n American Electric Power , raises concerns that the cli-\\nmate nuisance plaintiffs also  share the hope for state \\ncourt biases in the campaign to eliminate budgetary \\nshortfalls and otherwise make policy through tort liti-gation. \\n For example, and again turning to documents ob-\\ntained through open records laws, we see that, after \\nU.S. District Judge William Alsup dismissed the City \\nof Oakland\\u2019s \\u201cclimate nuisanc e\\u201d suit against many of \\nthe same defendants in June 2018,\\n11 a lobbyist hired to \\nassist with recruiting more governmental plaintiffs for \\nSher Edling12 passed along a note of encouragement to \\n \\n 11 City of Oakland, et al. v.

(\\u201cLDF\\u201d) has strived to secure \\nthe constitutional promise of equality for all people. Petitioner asks the Court to reconsider an important question about the Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s reach, which, more than any other constitutional provision, \\nembodies our Nation\\u2019s commitment to equal justice \\nunder the law.  \\nLDF has been at the forefront of efforts to enforce \\nthe Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s promise of equality. See, e.g. , Cooper v. Aaron , 358 U.S. 1 (1958);\\n Brown v. \\nBd. of Educ. of Topeka , 347 U.S. 483 (1954) . LDF has \\nalso led the fight of eradicating discrimination from jury verdicts. See, e.g. , Ham v. South Carolina , 409 \\nU.S. 524 (1973)\\n; Alexander v. Louisiana , 405 U.S. 625 \\n(1972) ; Swain v. Alabama , 380 U.S. 202 (1965). \\nLDF submits this brief to aid the Court in \\ndeciding whether the Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s Due Process Clause incorporates the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement against the States.\\n1  \\n  \\n                                                \\n1 Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.6, counsel for amicus \\ncuriae state that no counsel for a party authored this brief in \\nwhole or in part and that no person other than amicus curiae , its \\nmembers, or its counsel made a monetary contribution to the preparation or submission of this brief. All parties have consented to the filing of this brief. \\n2 \\n \\n SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \\nAfter the Civil War, Congress passed the \\nFourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of \\n1875 to protect the rights of newly freed African \\nAmericans. One of the rights protected by those provisions was the right to  serve on a jury. Indeed, \\nthis Court affirmed the centrality of jury service to the citizenship of African Americans 140 years ago. See \\nStrauder v. West Virginia , 100 U.S. 303 (1879). \\nThen, in 1898, white Louisianans convened a \\nconstitutional convention. Their goal was to craft a constitution that would \\u201cestablish the supremacy of \\nthe white race . . . to the extent to which it could be \\nlegally and constitutionally done . . . .\\u201d Louisiana \\nratified its non-unanimous jury provision at this convention to help achieve its goal of cementing white supremacy. While federal law made it illegal to exclude Black people from jury service, the delegates \\npassed the non-unanimous jury provision to nullify \\nthe votes of Black jurors and allow white jurors to more easily convict Black defendants. \\nLouisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury provision \\nworked exactly as intended. Up until 2018, when \\nLouisianans voted to remove the non-unanimous jury \\nprovision from their constitution, Black defendants were more likely to be convicted by non-unanimous juries than white defendants, and Black jurors were more likely than white jurors to be in the dissent. \\nThus, despite jury service being a hallmark of \\nAmerican citizenship, for ov er a century, Louisiana\\u2019s \\n3 \\n \\n non-unanimous jury provision effectively undermined \\nBlack participation on juries. \\nLouisiana has been permitted to thwart the \\nintent of the Reconstruction Congress in this manner because of this Court\\u2019s decision in Apodaca v. Oregon , \\n406 U.S. 404 (1972), in which Justice Powell\\u2019s idiosyncratic view that the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement does not apply to the States \\nwas the controlling opinion. Th is is the rare case in \\nwhich stare decisis should not control, and this Court \\nshould hold that the Sixth Amendment requires state juries\\u2014like federal juries\\u2014to be unanimous. \\nARGUMENT \\nI. THE HISTORY OF THE FOURTEENTH \\nAMENDMENT COMPELS THE INCORPORATION OF THE SIXTH AMENDMENT UNANIMOUS JURY TRIAL \\nRIGHT.  \\nThis Court recently reiterated that \\u201c[a] Bill of \\nRights protection is inco rporated . . . if it is \\n\\u2018fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty,\\u2019 or \\n\\u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\\u2019s history and tradition.\\u2019\\u201d  \\nTimbs v. Indiana , 139 S. Ct. 682, 687 (2019) (quoting \\nMcDonald v. Chicago , 561 U.S. 742, 767 (2010)). \\nAccordingly, when determining whether a provision of the Bill of Rights is \\u201cfundamental\\u201d or \\u201cdeeply rooted,\\u201d the Court reckons with the historical context \\nof the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e.g. , McDonald , \\n561 U.S. at 770-78 (explicating the position of \\u201cthe \\n4 \\n \\n Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth \\nAmendment\\u201d); id. at 776 (relying on \\u201c[e]vidence from \\nthe period immediately following the ratification of \\nthe Fourteenth Amendment\\u201d); Timbs , 139 S. Ct. at \\n688 (same). An examination of this history compels the incorporation of the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement. \\nIn the aftermath of the Civil War, Southern \\nwhites were neither prepared nor willing to accept the \\n\\u201cfundamentally altered . . . racial status quo in the \\nSouth.\\u201d\\n2 The Thirteenth Amendment\\u2019s ratification \\nabolished slavery in 1865.3 Nevertheless, recalcitrant \\nSouthern states persisted in \\u201csubjugat[ing] newly \\nfreed slaves and maintain[ing] the prewar racial \\nhierarchy.\\u201d Timbs , 139 S. Ct. at 688. Between  1865 \\nand 1866, Southern legislatures accomplished this by passing discriminatory statutes, known as Black \\nCodes, which \\u201creduce[d] blacks to a status somewhere \\nbetween that of slaves (which they no longer were) \\nand full free people (which most white southerners opposed).\\u201d\\n4 And Black Codes governed a wide range of \\naspects of everyday life, including the extent of African American access to the courtroom.\\n5 For \\n                                                \\n2 Paul Finkelman, John Bingham and the Background to the \\nFourteenth Amendment , 36 Akron L.

Id. at 413. \\nJustice White could not \\u201cassume that the majority of \\nthe jury will refuse to weigh the evidence and reach a \\ndecision upon rational grounds . . . or that a majority will deprive a man of his liberty on the basis of prejudice when a minority is presenting a reasonable argument in favor of acquittal.\\u201d Id. Justice White \\n\\u201csimply [found] no proof for the notion that a majority \\nwill disregard its instructions and cast its votes for \\nguilt or innocence based on prejudice rather than \\nevidence.\\u201d Id. at 413-14.  \\nIn so reasoning, Justice White\\u2019s opinion does not \\nreckon with the overwhelming evidence that shows \\nLouisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury provision was \\nenacted with discriminatory intent and was designed to facilitate white jurors being able to convict Black defendants over the dissent of Black jurors.  \\nAfter Reconstruction ended and federal troops left \\nthe South, Louisianan Democrats called a \\n12 \\n \\n Constitutional Convention in 1898.33 As two scholars \\nof this period summarized, \\u201cthe sinister purpose of the Convention was to create a racial architecture in \\nLouisiana that could circumvent the Reconstruction \\nAmendments and marginalize the political power of black citizens.\\u201d\\n34 It was at this Convention that \\nLouisiana ratified its non-unanimous jury \\nprovision.35  \\nThe Convention\\u2019s official record is replete with \\nreferences to its racist goals.

Everything quoted is from their interviews with counsel unless attributed otherwise. \\n19 \\n \\n year-old Mr. Howard has his own accounting practice. \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard both attended segregated schools growing up. In fact, they went to \\nthe same high school, as there was only one in the \\nParish that educated Black children. \\nIn 2014, two years before Mr. Ramos faced trial \\nfor second-degree murder, Mr. Newton and Mr. Howard were selected to serve on the jury for the trial \\nof Matthew Allen, a 20-year-old Black man also \\naccused of second-degree murder. The prosecution\\u2019s \\ntheory was that Mr. Allen intentionally shot and killed the victim; Mr. Allen\\u2019 s defense to the charge \\nwas that he acted in self-defense.\\n65 Mr. Newton and \\nMr. Howard were the only Black jurors. The other ten \\njurors on Mr. Allen\\u2019s jury were white.  \\nMr. Newton vividly recalled  his feelings when he \\nsaw the jury\\u2019s composition: \\u201cBobby and I saw from the beginning that our vote wasn\\u2019t going to matter. We \\nwere outnumbered.\\u201d \\u201cI could have just stayed home.\\u201d \\n\\u201cAin\\u2019t no difference we can make.\\u201d Mr. Newton felt \\ndoubly distraught when he saw that Mr. Allen had a \\u201cbad judge\\u201d who had been reprimanded for wearing blackface.\\n66 Mr. Newton thought to himself, \\u201cBuddy, \\nyou\\u2019re doomed.\\u201d \\n                                                \\n65 See State v. Allen , 2015-0675, 2015 WL 6951570, at *2 (La. Ct. \\nApp. 2015).  \\n66 In 2004, Judge Timothy Ellender was suspended for wearing \\nblackface, handcuffs, and a jail jumpsuit to a Halloween party.  \\nSee Seth Fox, Houma Judge Suspended for Wearing Blackface \\nHalloween Costume , Houma Today (Dec. 13, 2014), \\n20 \\n \\n Reflecting back, Mr. Newton and Mr. Howard \\nthought Mr. Allen\\u2019s race worked against him with the white jurors. \\u201cThey see a Black defendant in a drug \\ndeal and maybe think \\u2018he\\u2019s hustling corner to corner, \\nlet\\u2019s teach him a lesson,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Howard speculated. Mr. Newton echoed this sentiment: \\u201cI think they saw him \\nas a potential threat to the community.\\u201d  \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard looked at Mr. Allen \\ndifferently. They saw a young man who may have \\nmade a mistake, but who still had a life ahead of him. \\nMr. Howard thought these differing perspectives could be due to the fact \\u201ctheir life experiences were different.\\u201d  \\nAfter listening intently to the evidence, both Mr. \\nHoward and Newton favored finding Mr. Allen guilty of manslaughter. \\u201cI thought about his age. I thought he deserved a second chance,\\u201d Mr. Howard said quietly. Mr. Newton confirmed that he \\u201cnever thought \\nit was second-degree murder\\u201d and proposed to his \\nfellow jurors that Mr. Allen should be convicted of \\nmanslaughter, not murder.  \\nDeliberations gave both men hope that at least \\nsome of the white jurors would see the evidence their \\nway and would find Mr. Allen guilty of manslaughter, \\nnot murder. Mr. Howard recalled that one juror, a white woman, seemed to be leaning in favor of manslaughter going into lunch. Mr. Newton remembered there being two or three white jurors \\n                                                \\nhttps://www.houmatoday.com/article/DA/20041213/News/60809\\n9465/HC/.   \\n21 \\n \\n who seemed to think manslaughter was the just \\nconviction. \\nThings took a turn after lunch, however. Mr. \\nHoward recounted that he and Mr. Newton had lunch together, while the white jurors ate together. When they returned from lunch, all ten white jurors wanted to vote for second-degree murder; there was no convincing them otherwise, \\u201ceveryone was set in their \\nways.\\u201d  \\nMr. Newton\\u2019s prediction that his vote wouldn\\u2019t \\nmatter proved prescient. Th e jury convicted Mr. Allen \\nof second-degree murder by a vote of 10-2. All ten \\nwhite jurors voted for guilt. Mr. Newton and Mr. \\nHoward voted not guilty. \\nWhat took place troubled Mr. Howard and Mr. \\nNewton. Mr. Howard recalled: \\u201cI pretty much felt sorry for the young man, to tell you the truth.\\u201d Mr. \\nNewton was more shaken: \\u201cIt hurt me real bad when \\nI looked at that young man, and I looked at his mother and father, and I knew they weren\\u2019t going to see him again, not unless they go up to Angola.\\u201d\\n67 Indeed, Mr. \\nNewton felt the effects of the trial long after it was \\nover: \\u201cWhen I left that jury, it took me a couple of \\nweeks to get myself together. Serving on that jury \\ntook something out of me.\\u201d Mr. Allen, who entered prison for a crime he a when he was only 20, continues to serve a life sentence in Angola Prison.   \\n                                                \\n67 Adelson et al., supra note 57. \\n22 \\n \\n Mr. Newton realized that what happened in Mr. \\nAllen\\u2019s trial probably happened in many others, causing him to wonder, \\u201cHow many others had passed \\nthis way . . . and got the same treatment this boy got.\\u201d \\nThe trial, Mr. Newton explained, made him feel like his \\u201cvoice didn\\u2019t matter,\\u201d \\u201ca second-class citizen.\\u201d  \\nThis experience confirmed for Mr. Newton that \\nLouisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury system was unfair to \\nBlack defendants and Black jurors. In his opinion, the \\nprosecutors \\u201cfound a way to get around the system\\u201d \\nby limiting the number of Black people on Mr. Allen\\u2019s jury to two, knowing they only needed ten votes for a conviction. The trial shook Mr. Newton\\u2019s confidence in \\nthe fairness of Louisiana\\u2019s justice system: \\u201cI know I \\ncouldn\\u2019t sit there and think I\\u2019d get a fair trial.\\u201d  \\nMr. Newton took solace in the fact Louisiana \\nvoters repealed the non-unanimous jury provision last year.\\n68 He expressed that while he does think that \\n\\u201cjustice was served\\u201d during Mr. Allen\\u2019s trial, he felt \\n\\u201cencouraged\\u201d and \\u201cempowered\\u201d to serve on a jury now that his vote was guaranteed to matter. Mr. Howard \\nsaid that he, too, is ready to perform his \\u201ccivic duty\\u201d \\nand serve on a jury under Louisiana\\u2019s new unanimous jury scheme.  \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard\\u2019s experience is a \\nstark example of the indign ities inflicted upon Black \\npeople by Louisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury provision. It is a reminder that, until last year, Louisiana\\u2019s non-\\nunanimous jury system worked the way its racist \\n                                                \\n68 Oregon is now the only state with a non-unanimous jury \\nprovision. \\n23 \\n \\n proponents intended\\u2014to more easily convict Black \\ndefendants and to silence Black jurors. What makes this even worse, is that this system, conceived from \\nracism, has been operating with this Court\\u2019s blessing \\nfor 47 years. Apodaca must be overruled. This Court \\nshould hold that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity \\nrequirement against the States.  \\n \\n  \\n24 \\n \\n CONCLUSION \\nLDF respectfully urges this Court to hold that the \\nFourteenth Amendment incorporates the Sixth \\nAmendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement against the States.  \\nRespectfully submitted,  \\n \\nSherrilyn A.

While debating the extent to \\nwhich the Constitution should enshrine protections for religious freedom during the First Congress, \\nRepresentative Daniel Carroll of Maryland\\u2014one of \\nthe few Catholics among the Constitution\\u2019s \\nFramers\\u2014remarked \\u201cthe rights of conscience are, in \\ntheir nature, of peculiar delicacy, and will little bear \\nthe gentlest touch of governmental hand.\\u201d 1 Annals \\nof Cong. 757-58 (Joseph Gales ed., 1834) (Aug. 15, 1789). \\nNowhere are the rights of the religious more \\ndelicate than when they intersect with the freedom \\nto put faith into action, belief into words. If the \\nrobust religious freedom protections guaranteed by \\nour Constitution are to have any meaning, they must \\nbe capable of shielding a sincere religious believer from being coerced into speaking against the core \\ntenants of her faith. To hold otherwise would be to \\npermit the heavy hand of government to extinguish \\nreligious practice. This the Constitution will not \\nallow. \\nThe Founders understood that the First \\nAmendment, as drafted, protected all religious sects in their right to speak freely in accordance with t\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"gpt_response_1\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3977,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"(I) QUESTION PRESENTED\\n(III) TABLE OF CONTENTS\\nStatement of interest\\nRelevant statutory provisions\\nIntroduction\\nStatement\\nA.

First of all, because some of the short headlines are repeated, and because for each headline when I search I am searching through the entire text line by line from the start, I'm coming up repeated hits on the same line. Then, because I sort the list of starting matches, the repeated headers get placed next to each other and that messes up my process to find the start and end of each section. This is because I'm relying on the end of the previous section to find my start. So first off, I need a way to avoid repeats. Also I should probably just not sort the list.\n"

The 1968 National \\nTrails System Act (\\u201cTrails Act\\u201d) designated the Appa-\\nlachian Trail as a national scenic trail to \\u201cbe adminis-tered primarily as a footpath by the Secretary of the Interior,\\u201d 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1244(a)(1), but did not \\u201ctransfer among Federal agencies any management responsibil-ities established under any other law for federally ad-\\nministered lands\\u201d traversed by a designated trail, id. \\n\\u00a7 1246(a)(1)(A). The Mineral Leasing Act (MLA), as amended in 1973, authorizes the \\u201cSecretary of the In-terior or appropriate agency head\\u201d to grant rights-of-way through any federal lands \\u201cfor pipeline purposes for the transportation of oil [and] natural gas.\\u201d 30 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 185(a). \\u201cFederal l ands\\u201d means \\u201call lands owned \\nby the United States except lands in the National Park System.\\u201d Id. \\u00a7 185(b)(1).

As approved by the Forest Service and FERC, \\nMVP would cross under the Trail footpath on the for-ested ridge marking the Virginia-West Virginia border, \\nwest of Roanoke, Virginia. The Forest Service required \\nMountain Valley to construct a 600-foot-long bore roughly 80 feet beneath the ridgetop and Trail. By \\nplacing the pipeline at this  depth, the Forest Service \\npreserved a football field- length (300-foot) forested \\nbuffer to each side of the Trail. Drilling equipment \\nwould temporarily be placed in pits downslope and not \\nvisible from the Trail. All construction-related impacts, \\n \\nworked for decades to obtain permanent protection for the en-\\ntirety of the Trail. However, th e uncertainty resulting from the \\nFourth Circuit\\u2019s decision regard ing agency jurisdiction has cre-\\nated a further obstacle to comple ting a land exchange that would \\nprotect the Trail while providing a right-of-way for MVP. \\n 9 See MVP FEIS \\u00a7 3.0; MVP ROD 23-27.  \\n5 \\n such as noise, would be temporary, and no construction \\nwould occur on the footpath.10 \\n The Forest Service and BLM were well on their \\nway to addressing the Fourth Circuit\\u2019s remand regard-\\ning MVP\\u2019s approvals to cross the Jefferson National \\nForest when the Fourth Circuit issued the decision be-low. Mountain Valley was not a party to that proceed-\\ning, but the decision had the same practical effect for \\nMVP as it did for Atlantic\\u2014no federal agency could lawfully issue an MLA right-of-way to either pipeline \\nto cross the Trail on national forest lands. \\n 2.  The Appalachian Trail was conceived by pri-\\nvate individuals and hiking clubs in the 1920s as a \\nfootpath from Maine to Georgia.\\n11 With the support of \\nthe Forest Service, the George Washington and Jeffer-\\nson national forests and six other national forests \\nalong the Appalachians have included segments of the \\nTrail since its beginning. The National Park Service \\n(\\u201cPark Service\\u201d) supported Trail construction in Shen-\\nandoah and Great Smoky Mountains national parks. \\n Groups of private volunteers, including numerous \\nhiking and outdoor recreation-oriented clubs along the eastern seaboard, took responsibility for construction \\n \\n 10 MVP ROD 27. \\n 11 See Nat\\u2019l Park Serv., U.S. Dep\\u2019t of the Interior, Trails for \\nAmerica: Report on the  Nationwide Trail Study 32-33 (1966) (\\u201c Trails \\nfor America \\u201d), https://www.nps.gov/noco /learn/management/upload/ \\ntrails-for-america-1966.pdf.  \\n6 \\n and maintenance of local trail segments.12 The Forest \\nService and the Park Service dedicated significant \\neffort to trail-building under various Depression-era \\npublic works programs.13 By the time the Trail was \\ncompleted in 1937, more than 700 miles of the 2,200-\\nmile footpath had been constructed on federal lands, \\nmostly national forests. The majority of the newly com-pleted Appalachian Trail, however, remained on pri-\\nvate or state lands.\\n14 \\n The Park Service and the Forest Service were both \\nproponents of the Trail throughout its construction \\nand worked cooperatively to ensure maintenance and protection of the Trail after its completion.\\n15 Despite \\nthe federal land managers\\u2019 important roles, most re-\\nsponsibility for trail management remained with the local trail clubs.\\n16 \\n \\n 12 Trails for America , 32-33; see generally  Appalachian Trail \\nConservancy, The Appalachian Trail: Celebrating America\\u2019s \\nHiking Trail  15-38 (2012). \\n 13 Sally K.

See Light v. United States , 220 U.S. 523, 536-\\n37 (1911) (upholding federal government\\u2019s authority to \\nestablish forest reserves a dministered by Secretary of \\nAgriculture). As this Court stated over a century ago, \\u201cit is not for the courts to say how\\u201d the national forests \\nand the nation\\u2019s public land s \\u201cshall be administered. \\nThat is for Congress to determine.\\u201d Id. \\n By holding that the Appalachian Trail segment \\ncrossed by Atlantic consists of \\u201clands in the National \\nPark System,\\u201d Pet. App. 55a, 57a (No. 18-1584), the \\nFourth Circuit not only misapplied the plain language \\nof the law, but also usurped Congress\\u2019s exclusive con-stitutional prerogative to allocate among federal de-\\npartments jurisdiction over federal lands. The Fourth \\nCircuit erroneously conflated the Trail-related coordi-nation and administrative role that Congress assigned \\nto the Secretary of the In terior\\u2014and which the Secre-\\ntary later delegated to the Park Service\\u2014with the comprehensive land management and jurisdictional \\nresponsibility Congress assigned to the Secretary of \\nAgriculture, acting through the Forest Service. \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision directly contradicts \\nthe Trails Act\\u2019s recognition that the federal agency ad-ministering the lands over which a national trail \\npasses may be different than the agency charged to \\n10 \\n administer that trail. It also contradicts Congress\\u2019s \\nWeeks Act mandate that th e national forest lands \\ncrossed by MVP and Atlantic would be \\u201cpermanently \\nreserved, held and administered as national forest ,\\u201d \\nnot national park , lands. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 521 (emphasis \\nadded). \\n The Forest Service and Park Service had for over \\n50 years prior to the circuit court\\u2019s decision consist-\\nently interpreted the Trails Act to not alter the Forest Service\\u2019s jurisdiction. Congre ss chose to promote inter-\\nagency and stakeholder coordination, but did so in a \\nway that maintained the Department of Agriculture\\u2019s jurisdiction. Congress never designated the strips of \\nnational forest lands used by  the Trail as national park \\nlands. Congress simply assigned to the Interior Secre-tary the responsibility to acquire lands and coordinate \\namong the government agencies and trail clubs in-\\nvolved in managing various Trail segments. \\n--------------------------------- \\uf0a8 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nREASONS WHY THE \\nPETITIONS SHOULD BE GRANTED  \\n Rather than applying the plain text of the Trails \\nAct, which would harmonize it with the Weeks Act, the Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision found conflict where there is \\nnone. The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s opinion usurps Congress\\u2019s \\nplenary Property Clause power and imposes a result that conflicts with a half-century of agency practice. \\nSee Pet. at 24-25 (No. 18-1587); Pet. at 19-21 (No. \\n18-1584). The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision contradicts \\n11 \\n the plain language of the W eeks Act and Trails Act and \\nCongress\\u2019s consistent record of careful, deliberate sys-\\ntematizing of departmental jurisdiction over public \\nlands. Congress has been especially deliberate when deciding how to assign jurisdiction over public forest \\nlands between national forests and national parks. Na-\\ntional forests are managed for utilitarian, \\u201cmultiple use\\u201d purposes. National parks are managed for preser-\\nvation. \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s erroneous interpretation, if \\nnot addressed by this Court, will create broad un-\\ncertainty over public l ands management and impose \\nsignificant risks on Atlantic, MVP, and existing and \\nplanned energy infrastructure well beyond the sites, \\nprojects, and parties involved here. The Mineral Leas-ing Act provides the principal federal authority for \\ngranting oil and gas pipeline rights-of-way on federal \\npublic lands. The Forest Service emphasizes correctly that the Trail-crossing issue is the only aspect of the \\ndecision below that cannot be addressed by further \\nagency analysis, factual review, public notice and com-ment, or clarification. See Pet. 13-14 (No. 18-1584). This \\ncritical point applies equally to MVP. If allowed to \\nstand, the decision below eliminates federal MLA au-thority to grant or renew rights-of-way for gas pipe-\\nlines serving the millions of  Americans living along the \\neastern seaboard if the pipeline crosses the Trail, a court-erected barrier from central Maine to north \\nGeorgia. \\n  \\n12 \\n I. The Appalachian Tr ail Segment Crossed \\nBy The ACP Project Is Not \\u201cLand In The \\nNational Park System\\u201d Under The Mineral Leasing Act. \\n The Forest Service used its management discre-\\ntion eight decades ago to approve and assist with con-\\nstruction of the footpath, sign s, and shelters on national \\nforest lands to help create the Appalachian Trail. But \\nit did not transfer the lands traversed by that footpath \\nto the Park Service. Neither did the Trails Act. \\n At times, the Park Service has characterized the \\nAppalachian Trail as a unit of the National Park Sys-tem for its internal labeling purposes. See, e.g., Pet. \\nApp. 55a (No. 18-1584). And so me segments of the Trail \\nare on lands inside national parks. But there is no ba-sis in the law for concluding that the entire 2,200-mile \\nfootpath has been transformed into \\u201clands in the Na-\\ntional Park System\\u201d by a label. See 54 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 100102, \\n100501. The term is a conven ient administrative catch-\\nall, evident in the fact that Park System \\u201cunits\\u201d often \\ninclude areas of non-federal ownership or areas under other agencies\\u2019 jurisdictions. The Trail corridor con-\\ntains a variety of areas administered by state and fed-\\neral agencies and local entities.\\n20 \\n The Trail at the locations to be crossed by Atlantic \\nand MVP is a congressional ov erlay of a trails system \\nuse and footpath on national forest land, but it does not \\nchange the character or juris diction of that land. The \\n \\n 20 Nat\\u2019l Parks Conservation Ass\\u2019n, Appalachian National \\nScenic Trail: A Special Report  3 (March 2010). \\n13 \\n place remains national forest land. The inter-agency \\nand stakeholder cooperation for the Trail coordinated \\nby the Secretary of the Interior is a procedural re-\\nquirement of the Trails Ac t, not a reallocation of \\nland management jurisdiction from the Department of \\nAgriculture to the Department of the Interior. \\n \\nA. Statutory Background. \\n1. The National Forest System. \\n In 1891, Congress authorized the President to \\u201cset \\napart and reserve . . . public land bearing forests . . . as \\npublic reservations.\\u201d Forest Reserve Act of 1891, ch. \\n561, \\u00a7 24, 26 Stat. 1103 (codif ied at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 471 \\n(repealed 1976)). In the Organic Administration Act \\nof 1897, Congress provided that \\u201c[n]o national forest \\nshall be established, except to improve and protect the forest within the boundaries, or for the purpose of \\nsecuring favorable conditions of water flows, and to \\nfurnish a continuous supply of timber.\\u201d Organic Ad-ministration Act of 1897, ch. 2, \\u00a7 1, 30 Stat. 34 (codi-\\nfied at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 475). In 1905, Congress transferred \\njurisdiction over the national forests from the Depart-ment of the Interior to the Department of Agriculture. \\nForest Transfer Act of 1905, ch. 288, \\u00a7 1, 33 Stat. 628 \\n(codified as amended at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 472). The Forest Transfer Act directs that \\u201cthe Department of Agricul-\\nture shall execute . . . all laws affecting public lands \\nheretofore or hereafter reserved\\u201d as forest reserves under the 1891 Act. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 472. These acts, ini-\\ntially focused on public lands in the western United \\n14 \\n States, established the foundation of the current na-\\ntional forest system. See 36 C.F.R. \\u00a7 200.3(b)(2). \\n The 1911 Weeks Act then authorized the Secretary \\nof Agriculture to acquire pri vate lands to establish na-\\ntional forests in the eastern United States. Act of Mar. \\n1, 1911, ch. 186, \\u00a7 9, 36 Stat. 962, \\u00a7 6 (codified at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 515).\\n21 Congress also directed that those lands \\nbe \\u201cpermanently reserved, held, and administered as \\nnational forest lands under the provisions of \\u201d the 1891 Act as supplemented. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 521; see also id . \\n\\u00a7 521a. Both the George Washington and Jefferson na-\\ntional forests were among th e first national forests es-\\ntablished pursuant to these authorities.\\n22 \\n From the beginning, national forests were to be \\nmanaged for \\u201cmultiple use,\\u201d diverse public purposes \\nincluding commercial activi ties such as timber har-\\nvest, mining, grazing, and energy development. See, \\ne.g., United States v. New Mexico , 438 U.S. 696, 706-09 \\n& n.18 (1978); United States v. Grimaud , 220 U.S. 506, \\n515 (1911); Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960, 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 528-531; Charles F. Wilkinson & H. \\n \\n 21 See also  Harold K. Steen, The U.S. Forest Service: A His-\\ntory 122-29 (1976) (history of the Weeks Act). \\n 22 See Proclamation No. 1448, 40 Stat. 1779 (1918) (estab-\\nlishing the Shenandoah National Forest); Exec. Order No. 5867 (June 28, 1932) (renaming the Shenandoah National Forest the George Washington National Forest); Proclamation No. 2165, 1 Fed. Reg. 227, 227-29 (Apr. 24, 1936) (establishing the Jefferson \\nNational Forest); see also  Forest Serv., U.S. Dep\\u2019t of Agric., George \\nWashington National Forest: A History  11, 15 (1993), https://www. \\nfs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOC UMENTS/stelprd3832787.pdf. \\n15 \\n Michael Anderson, Land and Resource Planning in the \\nNational Forests , 64 Or. L. Rev. 1, 20-23, 53-60 (1985). \\n Congress has adjusted the Forest Service\\u2019s mis-\\nsion over time, but the mission has always included the \\nresponsibility to use the agency\\u2019s wide discretion to \\nmake land and resource decisions that balance among various, often competing uses. When Congress decides \\nto require the Forest Service to depart from multiple-\\nuse principles in order to exclude forest lands from commercial uses, Congress does so by specific direc-\\ntion, for instance by designat ing that certain areas be \\nmanaged as national forest wilderness, including vari-ous locations that include the Trail footpath,\\n23 none of \\nwhich are crossed by Atlantic or MVP. \\n \\n2. The National Park System.  \\n Congress established the National Park System to \\npreserve, not develop, federal lands and resources. The \\nPark Service\\u2019s preservation mission is very different from the Forest Service\\u2019s utilitarian mission.\\n24 In 1916, \\n \\n 23 E.g., Act of Nov. 9, 2000, Pub. L.

Id. \\u00a7 1244(a)(1). The Act delegated re-\\nsponsibility to coordinate administration of the Appa-\\nlachian Trail to the Secretary of the Interior and gave \\nthe Secretary of Agriculture equivalent responsibility for the Pacific Crest Trail. Congress did not change the \\njurisdictional status of the lands over which the trails \\ncross. As Professor Fairfax explained, \\u201c[i]rrespective of which Secretary has overa ll responsibility for a trail \\n[under the Trails Act], the Sec retary of the Interior is \\nin charge when a trail crosses Park or Bureau of Land Management lands and the Secr etary of Agriculture is \\nresponsible for management when a trail crosses For-\\nest Service land.\\u201d\\n25 \\n The Trails Act recognizes that a federal agency \\nother than the agency charged with the overall ad-ministration of a trail may have authority and re-\\nsponsibility for the administration of the lands  over \\nwhich the trail traverses. The latter retains its author-ity to administer those l ands despite the trail\\u2019s pres-\\nence. The statute is unambigu ous: \\u201cNothing . . . shall \\nbe deemed to transfer among Federal agencies any management responsibilities established under any \\nother law for federally admi nistered lands which are \\ncomponents of the National Trails System.\\u201d See 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 1246(a)(1)(A). \\n \\n \\n 25 Fairfax, Federal-State Cooperation , supra note 13, at 58; \\nsee also Cong.

When Congress Transfers Administrative \\nJurisdiction From The Agriculture De-\\npartment\\u2019s Forest Service And The Inte-\\nrior Department\\u2019s Park  Service, It Does \\nSo Explicitly. \\n The structure of the Trails  Act consistently reflects \\nCongress\\u2019s intent that federal agency land manage-\\nment jurisdiction be left undisturbed. The \\u201cSecretary \\ncharged with the administration of a national scenic . . . trail may relocate segments of a national scenic . . . \\ntrail right-of-way,\\u201d but only \\u201c with the concurrence of \\nthe head of the Federal agency having jurisdiction over the lands involved .\\u201d 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1246(b) (emphasis \\nadded). The Secretary \\u201cmay issue regulations,\\u201d but \\nonly \\u201c with the concurrence of the heads of any other \\nFederal agencies administering lands through which a \\n. . . national scenic . . . trail passes .\\u201d Id. \\u00a7 1246(i) (em-\\nphasis added). \\n Congress elsewhere consistently has been explicit \\nwhen it intends to transfe r jurisdiction from one fed-\\neral agency to ano ther. On the same day he signed the \\nTrails Act, President John son signed legislation es-\\ntablishing North Cascades National Park. That con-\\ntemporaneous legislation expressly transferred the \\nadministrative jurisdiction of lands from the national \\nforest system to the National Park System: \\nFederal property within the boundaries of the \\npark and recreation areas is hereby trans-ferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the \\nSecretary [of the Interior] for administration \\nby him as part of the park and recreation \\n19 \\n areas. The national forest land within such \\nboundaries is hereby eliminated from the na-\\ntional forests within which it was heretofore \\nlocated.  \\nAct of Jan. 15, 1968, Pub. L. No. 90-544, 82 Stat. 926 \\n(codified at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 90b(a)) (emphasis added).26 \\n Similarly, when establishing Great Basin National \\nPark some years later, Cong ress specified that \\u201c[l]ands \\nand waters . . . within the boundaries of the park which \\nwere administered by the Forest Service . . . prior to \\n[the date of enactment of this Act] are hereby trans-ferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secre-\\ntary [of the Interior].\\u201d 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 410mm-2; see also 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 192b-9 (boundary adjustments for Rocky Mountain National Park). \\n Two examples from the Appalachian Trail area \\nfurther demonstrate that when Congress puts land \\ninto a national park system unit, it says so. See 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 403k-1 (\\u201cSubject to valid existing rights, all lands within the boundaries of Great Smoky Moun-\\ntains National Park . . . hereafter shall be a part of the \\n \\n 26 In President Johnson\\u2019s remarks on signing the Trails Act, \\nhe stated that \\u201c[o]ur history of wise management of America\\u2019s na-tional forests has assisted us in designating the initial elements of the National Trails System. . . . : the Appalachian Trail and the \\nPacific Crest Trail.\\u201d Presidential Remarks Upon Signing Four Bills Relating to Conservation and Outdoor Recreation, 2 Pub. Papers 1000, 1001 (Oct. 2, 1968). H ad the Trails Act involved an \\nextensive jurisdictional transfer of national forest system land to the Park Service for the Appalachian Trail, it would have been unusual for the President to invoke the history of America\\u2019s na-\\ntional forest  management as an impetus for designating the Trail. \\n20 \\n national park and shall be subject to all laws, rules, \\nand regulations applicable to the national park.\\u201d); 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 403-3 (\\u201cSubject to valid existing rights, the \\nlands and interests in lands which comprise section 1-A of the Blue Ridge Parkway . . . are excluded from the \\nparkway, made a part of the Shenandoah National \\nPark, and shall be administer ed in accordance with the \\nAct of August 25, 1916 (39 Stat. 535; 16 U.S.C. 1-4).\\u201d). \\n Such jurisdictional transfer language is conspicu-\\nously absent from the Trails Act. Simply put, had Con-\\ngress intended to convert the Trail corridor lands into \\nlands of the National Park System, it would have said so. Any uncertainty over the significance of the absence \\nof transfer language should have been put to rest by \\nthe fact that the Trails Act lacks any of the other or-ganizational provisions that might reasonably be ex-\\npected to accompany a major change in allocation of \\nexecutive branch responsibilities across eight national forests in a fourteen-state region. The Trails Act makes \\nno mention of budget authority, personnel and prop-\\nerty reassignment, transition  schedule or process, re-\\nassignment of permits or easements. Indeed, the Trails \\nAct does not mention the Park Service except for the \\npurpose of maintaining a Trail map. See Whitman v. \\nAm. Trucking Ass\\u2019n , 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001) (\\u201cCon-\\ngress . . . does not alter the fundamental details of a \\nregulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provi-sions\\u2014it does not, one might say, hide elephants in \\nmouseholes.\\u201d). \\n Three other considerations strongly reinforce the \\nconclusion that the circuit court erred in interpreting \\n21 \\n the Trails Act. First , Congress had rejected at least \\neight proposals to transfer the national forests to the \\nInterior Department in the years preceding enactment \\nof the Trails Act, and it is highly unlikely that it would \\nhave transferred national forest lands sub silentio .27 \\nSecond , Congress has given significant consideration \\nto the question whether the relevant portions of the George Washington and Jefferson national forests \\ndeserved enhanced protection  from commercial develop-\\nment and has chosen not to do so, thus strongly indicat-ing that Congress would not have done indirectly by \\nimplication what it has de clined to do directly.\\n28 Third , \\n \\n 27 Ross W.

In an attempt to improve ad-\\nministration of the federal lands, President Reagan proposed a substantial exchange (consolidation) of lands and personnel be-tween the agencies, but even this more limited reorganization was prevented by Cong ress.\\u201d); U.S. Gov\\u2019t Accountability Off., \\nGAO-09-223, Federal Land Management: Observations on a Pos-\\nsible Move of the Forest Service in to the Department of the Interior  \\n56-61 (2009); see also  T.H.

Roosevelt\\u2019s administration related to potential trans-fer of national forest jurisdiction away from the Agriculture De-partment). \\n \\n28 Congress has considered the question whether the sections \\nof the Trail corridor at issue here merit special protection by the Forest Service. Congress has designated numerous sections of \\nGeorge Washington and Jefferson national forest  lands crossed \\nby the Appalachian Trail as wilderness under the Wilderness Act \\n \\n22 \\n numerous major interstate gas pipelines crossed the \\nlands used for the Trail at the time Congress approved \\nthe Trails Act.29 The interstate pipelines were then, as \\ntoday, subject to federal approval under the provisions of the Natural Gas Act. Had Congress sought to change \\nthe federal approval process for gas pipelines inter-\\nsecting the path of the Trail, it would have said some-thing, especially if the in tended change amounted to a \\nprohibition of federal rights-of-way. \\n \\nII. The Circuit Court\\u2019s Holding Conflicts With \\nThis Court\\u2019s Decisions On Harmonizing Potentially Confli cting Statutes. \\n The Fourth Circuit was faced with reconciling the \\nTrails Act with the Weeks Act to determine the ap-\\nplicability of the Mineral Leasing Act. The court mis-characterized the Trails Act in a way that presented an \\napparent conflict with the Weeks Act, which in turn vi-\\ntiated the Mineral Leasing Act. The court made no \\n \\nof 1964, 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1131-1136. See, e.g., Act of Oct. 30, 1984, \\nPub. L. No. 98-586, 98 Stat. 3105 (designating the Thunder Ridge, Mountain Lake, Peters Mountain, Beartown, Little Wilson Creek, \\nLewis Fork, Priest Wi lderness Areas in Virg inia). Congress has \\nnever found that the national forest lands proposed to be used for the Atlantic or MVP below-grade Trail crossings warrant wilder-ness protection. \\n \\n29 A 1968 map prepared by the Federal Power Commission, \\nFERC\\u2019s predecessor agency charged with implementation of the Natural Gas Act, shows multiple major gas pipelines in the area \\nof the Trail. That map is included as Attachment A. Attachment B shows the approximate route of the Trail superimposed on the map by amicus  Mountain Valley using contemporary geographic \\ninformation system data for the Trail\\u2019s current route. \\n23 \\n effort to interpret the Weeks Act in concert with the \\nTrails Act. By failing to even try to reconcile and har-\\nmonize the statutes, the Fourth Circuit transformed \\n\\u201cfrom expounder[ ] of what the law is into policy-\\nmaker[ ] choosing what the law should be .\\u201d Epic Sys. \\nCorp. v. Lewis , 138 S. Ct. 1612, 1624 (2018). \\n When \\u201cconfronted with two Acts of Congress alleg-\\nedly touching on the same topic, this Court is not at \\n\\u2018liberty to pick and choose among congressional enact-ments\\u2019 and must instead strive \\u2018to give effect to both.\\u2019 \\u201d \\nId. (quoting Morton v. Mancari , 417 U.S. 535, 551 \\n(1974)). The project challengers below bore a \\u201cheavy burden\\u201d\\u2014that was never met or even considered by \\nthe circuit court\\u2014to show that Congress implicitly dis-\\nplaced the controlling national forest-administration statutes through the 1968 Trails Act. See id . \\n The circuit court simply presumed  that the entire \\nalmost 2,200-mile long Trail corridor is land in the \\n\\u201cNational Park System\\u201d because the Trail was generi-\\ncally referenced in the record as a \\u201c \\u2018unit\\u2019 of the Na-tional Park System.\\u201d Pet. App. 55a (No. 18-1584). But \\na shorthand labeling reference, useful to agency staff \\nresponding to an internal Interior Department delega-tion of responsibility to implement the Trails Act, does \\nnot itself transfer administration of all lands within \\nthe Trail corridor to the Park Service, change the language of the Trails Act, or even modify the Park \\nService\\u2019s own longstanding administrative interpreta-\\ntion, application, and understanding of the Trails Act as reflected in the agency\\u2019s management documents \\nand consistent practice. See FCC v. Fox TV Stations , \\n24 \\n 556 U.S. 502, 513-16 (2009); see also  Pet. at 24-25 (No. \\n18-1587); Pet. at 19-21 (No. 18-1584). \\n The circuit court\\u2019s approach results in an implau-\\nsible reading of the Trails Act. Extending the Fourth \\nCircuit\\u2019s reasoning to other national scenic trails, such \\nas the Continental Divide Trail, where the Trails Act assigns to the Secretary of Agriculture the trail-admin-\\nistration role, see 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1244(a)(5), would convert \\nnarrow strips of Yellowstone, Glacier, and Rocky Moun-tain national parks into national forests without any \\ncongressional action. The same would hold true for the \\nfive other national scenic or historic trails adminis-tered by the Forest Service, many of which also trav-\\nerse national park system lands.\\n30 Numerous other \\nnational scenic and historic trails are administered by \\nthe Park Service. The circuit court\\u2019s decision, if applied \\nand followed nationwide, woul d elevate all those trails, \\n42,127 miles in all, to \\u201cland in the National Park Sys-tem.\\u201d\\n31 \\n--------------------------------- \\uf0a8 ---------------------------------  \\n \\n \\n 30 Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, Florida National Sce-\\nnic Trail, Nez Perce National Historic Trail, Arizona National Scenic Trail, and Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1244(a)(2), (13), (14), (27), (30). \\n \\n31 National Historic Trails , Nat\\u2019l Park Serv., https://www.nps. \\ngov/subjects/nationaltrailssystem/n ational-historic-trails.htm (last \\nvisited July 18, 2019).

Id. \\n25 \\n CONCLUSION \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision is inconsistent with \\nthe legal framework of the Trails Act, the national for-est statutes, and the Mineral Leasing Act. It is incon-\\nsistent with the established agency practice of over 50 \\nyears recognizing that\\u2014as between the Forest Service and Park Service\\u2014each agency administers its own \\nlands over which the Trail traverses. If there is to be \\nan alteration of the prior congressional dedication of the management and jurisdict ion of those national for-\\nests, that is for Congress\\u2014and not the courts\\u2014to de-\\ntermine. \\n Left unaddressed, the circuit court\\u2019s decision will \\nhave significant adverse consequences, not only for At-lantic and MVP, but also fo r future critical infrastruc-\\nture. Certiorari should be granted to clarify the status \\nof the national forest system lands traversed by the Appalachian National Scenic Trail and to remove the \\nbarriers to Trail-crossing authorizations imposed by \\nthe Fourth Circuit. \\nRespectfully submitted, \\nM\\nURRAY  D.

As approved by the Forest Service and FERC, \\nMVP would cross under the Trail footpath on the for-ested ridge marking the Virginia-West Virginia border, \\nwest of Roanoke, Virginia. The Forest Service required \\nMountain Valley to construct a 600-foot-long bore roughly 80 feet beneath the ridgetop and Trail. By \\nplacing the pipeline at this  depth, the Forest Service \\npreserved a football field- length (300-foot) forested \\nbuffer to each side of the Trail. Drilling equipment \\nwould temporarily be placed in pits downslope and not \\nvisible from the Trail. All construction-related impacts, \\n \\nworked for decades to obtain permanent protection for the en-\\ntirety of the Trail. However, th e uncertainty resulting from the \\nFourth Circuit\\u2019s decision regard ing agency jurisdiction has cre-\\nated a further obstacle to comple ting a land exchange that would \\nprotect the Trail while providing a right-of-way for MVP. \\n 9 See MVP FEIS \\u00a7 3.0; MVP ROD 23-27.  \\n5 \\n such as noise, would be temporary, and no construction \\nwould occur on the footpath.10 \\n The Forest Service and BLM were well on their \\nway to addressing the Fourth Circuit\\u2019s remand regard-\\ning MVP\\u2019s approvals to cross the Jefferson National \\nForest when the Fourth Circuit issued the decision be-low. Mountain Valley was not a party to that proceed-\\ning, but the decision had the same practical effect for \\nMVP as it did for Atlantic\\u2014no federal agency could lawfully issue an MLA right-of-way to either pipeline \\nto cross the Trail on national forest lands. \\n 2.  The Appalachian Trail was conceived by pri-\\nvate individuals and hiking clubs in the 1920s as a \\nfootpath from Maine to Georgia.\\n11 With the support of \\nthe Forest Service, the George Washington and Jeffer-\\nson national forests and six other national forests \\nalong the Appalachians have included segments of the \\nTrail since its beginning. The National Park Service \\n(\\u201cPark Service\\u201d) supported Trail construction in Shen-\\nandoah and Great Smoky Mountains national parks. \\n Groups of private volunteers, including numerous \\nhiking and outdoor recreation-oriented clubs along the eastern seaboard, took responsibility for construction \\n \\n 10 MVP ROD 27. \\n 11 See Nat\\u2019l Park Serv., U.S. Dep\\u2019t of the Interior, Trails for \\nAmerica: Report on the  Nationwide Trail Study 32-33 (1966) (\\u201c Trails \\nfor America \\u201d), https://www.nps.gov/noco /learn/management/upload/ \\ntrails-for-america-1966.pdf.  \\n6 \\n and maintenance of local trail segments.12 The Forest \\nService and the Park Service dedicated significant \\neffort to trail-building under various Depression-era \\npublic works programs.13 By the time the Trail was \\ncompleted in 1937, more than 700 miles of the 2,200-\\nmile footpath had been constructed on federal lands, \\nmostly national forests. The majority of the newly com-pleted Appalachian Trail, however, remained on pri-\\nvate or state lands.\\n14 \\n The Park Service and the Forest Service were both \\nproponents of the Trail throughout its construction \\nand worked cooperatively to ensure maintenance and protection of the Trail after its completion.\\n15 Despite \\nthe federal land managers\\u2019 important roles, most re-\\nsponsibility for trail management remained with the local trail clubs.\\n16 \\n \\n 12 Trails for America , 32-33; see generally  Appalachian Trail \\nConservancy, The Appalachian Trail: Celebrating America\\u2019s \\nHiking Trail  15-38 (2012). \\n 13 Sally K.

See Light v. United States , 220 U.S. 523, 536-\\n37 (1911) (upholding federal government\\u2019s authority to \\nestablish forest reserves a dministered by Secretary of \\nAgriculture). As this Court stated over a century ago, \\u201cit is not for the courts to say how\\u201d the national forests \\nand the nation\\u2019s public land s \\u201cshall be administered. \\nThat is for Congress to determine.\\u201d Id. \\n By holding that the Appalachian Trail segment \\ncrossed by Atlantic consists of \\u201clands in the National \\nPark System,\\u201d Pet. App. 55a, 57a (No. 18-1584), the \\nFourth Circuit not only misapplied the plain language \\nof the law, but also usurped Congress\\u2019s exclusive con-stitutional prerogative to allocate among federal de-\\npartments jurisdiction over federal lands. The Fourth \\nCircuit erroneously conflated the Trail-related coordi-nation and administrative role that Congress assigned \\nto the Secretary of the In terior\\u2014and which the Secre-\\ntary later delegated to the Park Service\\u2014with the comprehensive land management and jurisdictional \\nresponsibility Congress assigned to the Secretary of \\nAgriculture, acting through the Forest Service. \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision directly contradicts \\nthe Trails Act\\u2019s recognition that the federal agency ad-ministering the lands over which a national trail \\npasses may be different than the agency charged to \\n10 \\n administer that trail. It also contradicts Congress\\u2019s \\nWeeks Act mandate that th e national forest lands \\ncrossed by MVP and Atlantic would be \\u201cpermanently \\nreserved, held and administered as national forest ,\\u201d \\nnot national park , lands. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 521 (emphasis \\nadded). \\n The Forest Service and Park Service had for over \\n50 years prior to the circuit court\\u2019s decision consist-\\nently interpreted the Trails Act to not alter the Forest Service\\u2019s jurisdiction. Congre ss chose to promote inter-\\nagency and stakeholder coordination, but did so in a \\nway that maintained the Department of Agriculture\\u2019s jurisdiction. Congress never designated the strips of \\nnational forest lands used by  the Trail as national park \\nlands. Congress simply assigned to the Interior Secre-tary the responsibility to acquire lands and coordinate \\namong the government agencies and trail clubs in-\\nvolved in managing various Trail segments. \\n--------------------------------- \\uf0a8 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nREASONS WHY THE \\nPETITIONS SHOULD BE GRANTED  \\n Rather than applying the plain text of the Trails \\nAct, which would harmonize it with the Weeks Act, the Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision found conflict where there is \\nnone. The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s opinion usurps Congress\\u2019s \\nplenary Property Clause power and imposes a result that conflicts with a half-century of agency practice. \\nSee Pet. at 24-25 (No. 18-1587); Pet. at 19-21 (No. \\n18-1584). The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision contradicts \\n11 \\n the plain language of the W eeks Act and Trails Act and \\nCongress\\u2019s consistent record of careful, deliberate sys-\\ntematizing of departmental jurisdiction over public \\nlands. Congress has been especially deliberate when deciding how to assign jurisdiction over public forest \\nlands between national forests and national parks. Na-\\ntional forests are managed for utilitarian, \\u201cmultiple use\\u201d purposes. National parks are managed for preser-\\nvation. \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s erroneous interpretation, if \\nnot addressed by this Court, will create broad un-\\ncertainty over public l ands management and impose \\nsignificant risks on Atlantic, MVP, and existing and \\nplanned energy infrastructure well beyond the sites, \\nprojects, and parties involved here. The Mineral Leas-ing Act provides the principal federal authority for \\ngranting oil and gas pipeline rights-of-way on federal \\npublic lands. The Forest Service emphasizes correctly that the Trail-crossing issue is the only aspect of the \\ndecision below that cannot be addressed by further \\nagency analysis, factual review, public notice and com-ment, or clarification. See Pet. 13-14 (No. 18-1584). This \\ncritical point applies equally to MVP. If allowed to \\nstand, the decision below eliminates federal MLA au-thority to grant or renew rights-of-way for gas pipe-\\nlines serving the millions of  Americans living along the \\neastern seaboard if the pipeline crosses the Trail, a court-erected barrier from central Maine to north \\nGeorgia. \\n  \\n12 \\n I. The Appalachian Tr ail Segment Crossed \\nBy The ACP Project Is Not \\u201cLand In The \\nNational Park System\\u201d Under The Mineral Leasing Act. \\n The Forest Service used its management discre-\\ntion eight decades ago to approve and assist with con-\\nstruction of the footpath, sign s, and shelters on national \\nforest lands to help create the Appalachian Trail. But \\nit did not transfer the lands traversed by that footpath \\nto the Park Service. Neither did the Trails Act. \\n At times, the Park Service has characterized the \\nAppalachian Trail as a unit of the National Park Sys-tem for its internal labeling purposes. See, e.g., Pet. \\nApp. 55a (No. 18-1584). And so me segments of the Trail \\nare on lands inside national parks. But there is no ba-sis in the law for concluding that the entire 2,200-mile \\nfootpath has been transformed into \\u201clands in the Na-\\ntional Park System\\u201d by a label. See 54 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 100102, \\n100501. The term is a conven ient administrative catch-\\nall, evident in the fact that Park System \\u201cunits\\u201d often \\ninclude areas of non-federal ownership or areas under other agencies\\u2019 jurisdictions.

The inter-agency \\nand stakeholder cooperation for the Trail coordinated \\nby the Secretary of the Interior is a procedural re-\\nquirement of the Trails Ac t, not a reallocation of \\nland management jurisdiction from the Department of \\nAgriculture to the Department of the Interior. \\n \\nA. Statutory Background. \\n1. The National Forest System. \\n In 1891, Congress authorized the President to \\u201cset \\napart and reserve . . . public land bearing forests . . . as \\npublic reservations.\\u201d Forest Reserve Act of 1891, ch. \\n561, \\u00a7 24, 26 Stat. 1103 (codif ied at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 471 \\n(repealed 1976)). In the Organic Administration Act \\nof 1897, Congress provided that \\u201c[n]o national forest \\nshall be established, except to improve and protect the forest within the boundaries, or for the purpose of \\nsecuring favorable conditions of water flows, and to \\nfurnish a continuous supply of timber.\\u201d Organic Ad-ministration Act of 1897, ch. 2, \\u00a7 1, 30 Stat. 34 (codi-\\nfied at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 475). In 1905, Congress transferred \\njurisdiction over the national forests from the Depart-ment of the Interior to the Department of Agriculture. \\nForest Transfer Act of 1905, ch. 288, \\u00a7 1, 33 Stat. 628 \\n(codified as amended at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 472). The Forest Transfer Act directs that \\u201cthe Department of Agricul-\\nture shall execute . . . all laws affecting public lands \\nheretofore or hereafter reserved\\u201d as forest reserves under the 1891 Act. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 472. These acts, ini-\\ntially focused on public lands in the western United \\n14 \\n States, established the foundation of the current na-\\ntional forest system. See 36 C.F.R. \\u00a7 200.3(b)(2). \\n The 1911 Weeks Act then authorized the Secretary \\nof Agriculture to acquire pri vate lands to establish na-\\ntional forests in the eastern United States. Act of Mar. \\n1, 1911, ch. 186, \\u00a7 9, 36 Stat. 962, \\u00a7 6 (codified at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 515).\\n21 Congress also directed that those lands \\nbe \\u201cpermanently reserved, held, and administered as \\nnational forest lands under the provisions of \\u201d the 1891 Act as supplemented. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 521; see also id . \\n\\u00a7 521a. Both the George Washington and Jefferson na-\\ntional forests were among th e first national forests es-\\ntablished pursuant to these authorities.\\n22 \\n From the beginning, national forests were to be \\nmanaged for \\u201cmultiple use,\\u201d diverse public purposes \\nincluding commercial activi ties such as timber har-\\nvest, mining, grazing, and energy development. See, \\ne.g., United States v. New Mexico , 438 U.S. 696, 706-09 \\n& n.18 (1978); United States v. Grimaud , 220 U.S. 506, \\n515 (1911); Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960, 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 528-531; Charles F. Wilkinson & H. \\n \\n 21 See also  Harold K. Steen, The U.S. Forest Service: A His-\\ntory 122-29 (1976) (history of the Weeks Act). \\n 22 See Proclamation No. 1448, 40 Stat. 1779 (1918) (estab-\\nlishing the Shenandoah National Forest); Exec. Order No. 5867 (June 28, 1932) (renaming the Shenandoah National Forest the George Washington National Forest); Proclamation No. 2165, 1 Fed. Reg. 227, 227-29 (Apr. 24, 1936) (establishing the Jefferson \\nNational Forest); see also  Forest Serv., U.S. Dep\\u2019t of Agric., George \\nWashington National Forest: A History  11, 15 (1993), https://www. \\nfs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOC UMENTS/stelprd3832787.pdf. \\n15 \\n Michael Anderson, Land and Resource Planning in the \\nNational Forests , 64 Or. L. Rev. 1, 20-23, 53-60 (1985). \\n Congress has adjusted the Forest Service\\u2019s mis-\\nsion over time, but the mission has always included the \\nresponsibility to use the agency\\u2019s wide discretion to \\nmake land and resource decisions that balance among various, often competing uses. When Congress decides \\nto require the Forest Service to depart from multiple-\\nuse principles in order to exclude forest lands from commercial uses, Congress does so by specific direc-\\ntion, for instance by designat ing that certain areas be \\nmanaged as national forest wilderness, including vari-ous locations that include the Trail footpath,\\n23 none of \\nwhich are crossed by Atlantic or MVP. \\n \\n2. The National Park System.  \\n Congress established the National Park System to \\npreserve, not develop, federal lands and resources. The \\nPark Service\\u2019s preservation mission is very different from the Forest Service\\u2019s utilitarian mission.\\n24 In 1916, \\n \\n 23 E.g., Act of Nov. 9, 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-471, 114 Stat. \\n2057 (designating the Priest Wilderness Area in Virginia); Act of Oct. 30, 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-586, 98 Stat. 3105 (designating the Thunder Ridge, Mountain Lake , Peters Mountain, Beartown, \\nLittle Wilson Creek, Lewis Fork, Priest Wilderness Areas in Virginia). \\n \\n24 See, e.g., Joseph L. Sax, Mountains Without Handrails, Re-\\nflections on the National Parks  5-9 (1980) (describing early history \\nand development of federal national parks policy); see generally  \\nJohn Ise, Our National Park Policy: A Critical History  185-95 \\n(1961) (history of national park policy during the period preceding and accompanying completion of the Appalachian Trail); Elmo R. \\n \\n16 \\n Congress provided that the \\u201cfundamental purposes of \\nthe said parks, monuments, and reservations . . . is to \\nconserve the scenery and the natural and historic ob-\\njects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same . . . unimpaired for the enjoy-\\nment of future generations.\\u201d Nat\\u2019l Park Serv. Organic \\nAct of 1916, ch. 408, \\u00a7 1, 39 Stat. 535 (codified as \\namended at 54 U.S.C. \\u00a7 100101). \\n National park lands are to be preserved and, where \\npossible, enjoyed. But for the national forests, Con-\\ngress has long emphasized t hat \\u201cthere must always be \\n. . . as primary objects and purposes the utilitarian use of land, of water, and of timber, as contributing to the \\nwealth of all the people.\\u201d H.R . Rep. No. 64-700, at 3 (1916). \\n \\n3. The National Trails System.  \\n The National Trails System Act seeks \\u201cto promote \\nthe preservation of, public a ccess to, travel within, and \\nenjoyment and appreciation of the open-air, outdoor areas and historic resources of the Nation.\\u201d 16 U.S.C. \\n\\u00a7 1241(a). The Trails Act authorized the creation of a \\nNational Trail System comprised of the national his-toric trails, national recreation trails, and national sce-\\nnic trails. Id. \\u00a7 1242(a). \\n The Trails Act designated the Appalachian Trail \\nand the Pacific Crest Trail as  the nation\\u2019s first national \\n \\nRichardson, The Politics of Conservation: Crusades and Contro-\\nversies 1897-1913 , at 22-46 (1962) (history of formative public pol-\\nicy debates over assignment of departmental authority over federal forest lands). \\n17 \\n scenic trails. Id. \\u00a7 1244(a)(1). The Act delegated re-\\nsponsibility to coordinate administration of the Appa-\\nlachian Trail to the Secretary of the Interior and gave \\nthe Secretary of Agriculture equivalent responsibility for the Pacific Crest Trail. Congress did not change the \\njurisdictional status of the lands over which the trails \\ncross. As Professor Fairfax explained, \\u201c[i]rrespective of which Secretary has overa ll responsibility for a trail \\n[under the Trails Act], the Sec retary of the Interior is \\nin charge when a trail crosses Park or Bureau of Land Management lands and the Secr etary of Agriculture is \\nresponsible for management when a trail crosses For-\\nest Service land.\\u201d\\n25 \\n The Trails Act recognizes that a federal agency \\nother than the agency charged with the overall ad-ministration of a trail may have authority and re-\\nsponsibility for the administration of the lands  over \\nwhich the trail traverses. The latter retains its author-ity to administer those l ands despite the trail\\u2019s pres-\\nence. The statute is unambigu ous: \\u201cNothing . . . shall \\nbe deemed to transfer among Federal agencies any management responsibilities established under any \\nother law for federally admi nistered lands which are \\ncomponents of the National Trails System.\\u201d See 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 1246(a)(1)(A). \\n \\n \\n 25 Fairfax, Federal-State Cooperation , supra note 13, at 58; \\nsee also Cong. Research Serv., R43868, The National Trails Sys-\\ntem: A Brief Overview  6-7 (2015). \\n18 \\n B. When Congress Transfers Administrative \\nJurisdiction From The Agriculture De-\\npartment\\u2019s Forest Service And The Inte-\\nrior Department\\u2019s Park  Service, It Does \\nSo Explicitly. \\n The structure of the Trails  Act consistently reflects \\nCongress\\u2019s intent that federal agency land manage-\\nment jurisdiction be left undisturbed. The \\u201cSecretary \\ncharged with the administration of a national scenic . . . trail may relocate segments of a national scenic . . . \\ntrail right-of-way,\\u201d but only \\u201c with the concurrence of \\nthe head of the Federal agency having jurisdiction over the lands involved .\\u201d 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1246(b) (emphasis \\nadded). The Secretary \\u201cmay issue regulations,\\u201d but \\nonly \\u201c with the concurrence of the heads of any other \\nFederal agencies administering lands through which a \\n. . . national scenic . . . trail passes .\\u201d Id. \\u00a7 1246(i) (em-\\nphasis added). \\n Congress elsewhere consistently has been explicit \\nwhen it intends to transfe r jurisdiction from one fed-\\neral agency to ano ther. On the same day he signed the \\nTrails Act, President John son signed legislation es-\\ntablishing North Cascades National Park. That con-\\ntemporaneous legislation expressly transferred the \\nadministrative jurisdiction of lands from the national \\nforest system to the National Park System: \\nFederal property within the boundaries of the \\npark and recreation areas is hereby trans-ferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the \\nSecretary [of the Interior] for administration \\nby him as part of the park and recreation \\n19 \\n areas. The national forest land within such \\nboundaries is hereby eliminated from the na-\\ntional forests within which it was heretofore \\nlocated.  \\nAct of Jan. 15, 1968, Pub. L. No. 90-544, 82 Stat. 926 \\n(codified at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 90b(a)) (emphasis added).26 \\n Similarly, when establishing Great Basin National \\nPark some years later, Cong ress specified that \\u201c[l]ands \\nand waters . . . within the boundaries of the park which \\nwere administered by the Forest Service . . . prior to \\n[the date of enactment of this Act] are hereby trans-ferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secre-\\ntary [of the Interior].\\u201d 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 410mm-2; see also 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 192b-9 (boundary adjustments for Rocky Mountain National Park). \\n Two examples from the Appalachian Trail area \\nfurther demonstrate that when Congress puts land \\ninto a national park system unit, it says so. See 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 403k-1 (\\u201cSubject to valid existing rights, all lands within the boundaries of Great Smoky Moun-\\ntains National Park . . . hereafter shall be a part of the \\n \\n 26 In President Johnson\\u2019s remarks on signing the Trails Act, \\nhe stated that \\u201c[o]ur history of wise management of America\\u2019s na-tional forests has assisted us in designating the initial elements of the National Trails System. . . . : the Appalachian Trail and the \\nPacific Crest Trail.\\u201d Presidential Remarks Upon Signing Four Bills Relating to Conservation and Outdoor Recreation, 2 Pub. Papers 1000, 1001 (Oct. 2, 1968). H ad the Trails Act involved an \\nextensive jurisdictional transfer of national forest system land to the Park Service for the Appalachian Trail, it would have been unusual for the President to invoke the history of America\\u2019s na-\\ntional forest  management as an impetus for designating the Trail. \\n20 \\n national park and shall be subject to all laws, rules, \\nand regulations applicable to the national park.\\u201d); 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 403-3 (\\u201cSubject to valid existing rights, the \\nlands and interests in lands which comprise section 1-A of the Blue Ridge Parkway . . . are excluded from the \\nparkway, made a part of the Shenandoah National \\nPark, and shall be administer ed in accordance with the \\nAct of August 25, 1916 (39 Stat. 535; 16 U.S.C. 1-4).\\u201d). \\n Such jurisdictional transfer language is conspicu-\\nously absent from the Trails Act. Simply put, had Con-\\ngress intended to convert the Trail corridor lands into \\nlands of the National Park System, it would have said so. Any uncertainty over the significance of the absence \\nof transfer language should have been put to rest by \\nthe fact that the Trails Act lacks any of the other or-ganizational provisions that might reasonably be ex-\\npected to accompany a major change in allocation of \\nexecutive branch responsibilities across eight national forests in a fourteen-state region. The Trails Act makes \\nno mention of budget authority, personnel and prop-\\nerty reassignment, transition  schedule or process, re-\\nassignment of permits or easements. Indeed, the Trails \\nAct does not mention the Park Service except for the \\npurpose of maintaining a Trail map. See Whitman v. \\nAm. Trucking Ass\\u2019n , 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001) (\\u201cCon-\\ngress . . . does not alter the fundamental details of a \\nregulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provi-sions\\u2014it does not, one might say, hide elephants in \\nmouseholes.\\u201d). \\n Three other considerations strongly reinforce the \\nconclusion that the circuit court erred in interpreting \\n21 \\n the Trails Act. First , Congress had rejected at least \\neight proposals to transfer the national forests to the \\nInterior Department in the years preceding enactment \\nof the Trails Act, and it is highly unlikely that it would \\nhave transferred national forest lands sub silentio .27 \\nSecond , Congress has given significant consideration \\nto the question whether the relevant portions of the George Washington and Jefferson national forests \\ndeserved enhanced protection  from commercial develop-\\nment and has chosen not to do so, thus strongly indicat-ing that Congress would not have done indirectly by \\nimplication what it has de clined to do directly.\\n28 Third , \\n \\n 27 Ross W.

In an attempt to improve ad-\\nministration of the federal lands, President Reagan proposed a substantial exchange (consolidation) of lands and personnel be-tween the agencies, but even this more limited reorganization was prevented by Cong ress.\\u201d); U.S. Gov\\u2019t Accountability Off., \\nGAO-09-223, Federal Land Management: Observations on a Pos-\\nsible Move of the Forest Service in to the Department of the Interior  \\n56-61 (2009); see also  T.H.

Roosevelt\\u2019s administration related to potential trans-fer of national forest jurisdiction away from the Agriculture De-partment). \\n \\n28 Congress has considered the question whether the sections \\nof the Trail corridor at issue here merit special protection by the Forest Service. Congress has designated numerous sections of \\nGeorge Washington and Jefferson national forest  lands crossed \\nby the Appalachian Trail as wilderness under the Wilderness Act \\n \\n22 \\n numerous major interstate gas pipelines crossed the \\nlands used for the Trail at the time Congress approved \\nthe Trails Act.29 The interstate pipelines were then, as \\ntoday, subject to federal approval under the provisions of the Natural Gas Act. Had Congress sought to change \\nthe federal approval process for gas pipelines inter-\\nsecting the path of the Trail, it would have said some-thing, especially if the in tended change amounted to a \\nprohibition of federal rights-of-way. \\n \\nII. The Circuit Court\\u2019s Holding Conflicts With \\nThis Court\\u2019s Decisions On Harmonizing Potentially Confli cting Statutes. \\n The Fourth Circuit was faced with reconciling the \\nTrails Act with the Weeks Act to determine the ap-\\nplicability of the Mineral Leasing Act. The court mis-characterized the Trails Act in a way that presented an \\napparent conflict with the Weeks Act, which in turn vi-\\ntiated the Mineral Leasing Act. The court made no \\n \\nof 1964, 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1131-1136. See, e.g., Act of Oct. 30, 1984, \\nPub. L. No. 98-586, 98 Stat. 3105 (designating the Thunder Ridge, Mountain Lake, Peters Mountain, Beartown, Little Wilson Creek, \\nLewis Fork, Priest Wi lderness Areas in Virg inia). Congress has \\nnever found that the national forest lands proposed to be used for the Atlantic or MVP below-grade Trail crossings warrant wilder-ness protection. \\n \\n29 A 1968 map prepared by the Federal Power Commission, \\nFERC\\u2019s predecessor agency charged with implementation of the Natural Gas Act, shows multiple major gas pipelines in the area \\nof the Trail. That map is included as Attachment A. Attachment B shows the approximate route of the Trail superimposed on the map by amicus  Mountain Valley using contemporary geographic \\ninformation system data for the Trail\\u2019s current route. \\n23 \\n effort to interpret the Weeks Act in concert with the \\nTrails Act. By failing to even try to reconcile and har-\\nmonize the statutes, the Fourth Circuit transformed \\n\\u201cfrom expounder[ ] of what the law is into policy-\\nmaker[ ] choosing what the law should be .\\u201d Epic Sys. \\nCorp. v. Lewis , 138 S. Ct. 1612, 1624 (2018). \\n When \\u201cconfronted with two Acts of Congress alleg-\\nedly touching on the same topic, this Court is not at \\n\\u2018liberty to pick and choose among congressional enact-ments\\u2019 and must instead strive \\u2018to give effect to both.\\u2019 \\u201d \\nId. (quoting Morton v. Mancari , 417 U.S. 535, 551 \\n(1974)). The project challengers below bore a \\u201cheavy burden\\u201d\\u2014that was never met or even considered by \\nthe circuit court\\u2014to show that Congress implicitly dis-\\nplaced the controlling national forest-administration statutes through the 1968 Trails Act. See id . \\n The circuit court simply presumed  that the entire \\nalmost 2,200-mile long Trail corridor is land in the \\n\\u201cNational Park System\\u201d because the Trail was generi-\\ncally referenced in the record as a \\u201c \\u2018unit\\u2019 of the Na-tional Park System.\\u201d Pet. App. 55a (No. 18-1584). But \\na shorthand labeling reference, useful to agency staff \\nresponding to an internal Interior Department delega-tion of responsibility to implement the Trails Act, does \\nnot itself transfer administration of all lands within \\nthe Trail corridor to the Park Service, change the language of the Trails Act, or even modify the Park \\nService\\u2019s own longstanding administrative interpreta-\\ntion, application, and understanding of the Trails Act as reflected in the agency\\u2019s management documents \\nand consistent practice. See FCC v. Fox TV Stations , \\n24 \\n 556 U.S. 502, 513-16 (2009); see also  Pet. at 24-25 (No. \\n18-1587); Pet. at 19-21 (No. 18-1584). \\n The circuit court\\u2019s approach results in an implau-\\nsible reading of the Trails Act. Extending the Fourth \\nCircuit\\u2019s reasoning to other national scenic trails, such \\nas the Continental Divide Trail, where the Trails Act assigns to the Secretary of Agriculture the trail-admin-\\nistration role, see 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1244(a)(5), would convert \\nnarrow strips of Yellowstone, Glacier, and Rocky Moun-tain national parks into national forests without any \\ncongressional action. The same would hold true for the \\nfive other national scenic or historic trails adminis-tered by the Forest Service, many of which also trav-\\nerse national park system lands.\\n30 Numerous other \\nnational scenic and historic trails are administered by \\nthe Park Service. The circuit court\\u2019s decision, if applied \\nand followed nationwide, woul d elevate all those trails, \\n42,127 miles in all, to \\u201cland in the National Park Sys-tem.\\u201d\\n31 \\n--------------------------------- \\uf0a8 ---------------------------------  \\n \\n \\n 30 Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, Florida National Sce-\\nnic Trail, Nez Perce National Historic Trail, Arizona National Scenic Trail, and Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1244(a)(2), (13), (14), (27), (30). \\n \\n31 National Historic Trails , Nat\\u2019l Park Serv., https://www.nps. \\ngov/subjects/nationaltrailssystem/n ational-historic-trails.htm (last \\nvisited July 18, 2019).

Id. \\n25 \\n CONCLUSION \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision is inconsistent with \\nthe legal framework of the Trails Act, the national for-est statutes, and the Mineral Leasing Act. It is incon-\\nsistent with the established agency practice of over 50 \\nyears recognizing that\\u2014as between the Forest Service and Park Service\\u2014each agency administers its own \\nlands over which the Trail traverses. If there is to be \\nan alteration of the prior congressional dedication of the management and jurisdict ion of those national for-\\nests, that is for Congress\\u2014and not the courts\\u2014to de-\\ntermine. \\n Left unaddressed, the circuit court\\u2019s decision will \\nhave significant adverse consequences, not only for At-lantic and MVP, but also fo r future critical infrastruc-\\nture. Certiorari should be granted to clarify the status \\nof the national forest system lands traversed by the Appalachian National Scenic Trail and to remove the \\nbarriers to Trail-crossing authorizations imposed by \\nthe Fourth Circuit. \\nRespectfully submitted, \\nM\\nURRAY  D.

As approved by the Forest Service and FERC, \\nMVP would cross under the Trail footpath on the for-ested ridge marking the Virginia-West Virginia border, \\nwest of Roanoke, Virginia. The Forest Service required \\nMountain Valley to construct a 600-foot-long bore roughly 80 feet beneath the ridgetop and Trail. By \\nplacing the pipeline at this  depth, the Forest Service \\npreserved a football field- length (300-foot) forested \\nbuffer to each side of the Trail. Drilling equipment \\nwould temporarily be placed in pits downslope and not \\nvisible from the Trail. All construction-related impacts, \\n \\nworked for decades to obtain permanent protection for the en-\\ntirety of the Trail. However, th e uncertainty resulting from the \\nFourth Circuit's decision regard ing agency jurisdiction has cre-\\nated a further obstacle to comple ting a land exchange that would \\nprotect the Trail while providing a right-of-way for MVP. \\n 9 See MVP FEIS \\u00a7 3.0; MVP ROD 23-27.  \\n5 \\n such as noise, would be temporary, and no construction \\nwould occur on the footpath.10 \\n The Forest Service and BLM were well on their \\nway to addressing the Fourth Circuit's remand regard-\\ning MVP's approvals to cross the Jefferson National \\nForest when the Fourth Circuit issued the decision be-low. Mountain Valley was not a party to that proceed-\\ning, but the decision had the same practical effect for \\nMVP as it did for Atlantic\\u2014no federal agency could lawfully issue an MLA right-of-way to either pipeline \\nto cross the Trail on national forest lands. \\n 2.  The Appalachian Trail was conceived by pri-\\nvate individuals and hiking clubs in the 1920s as a \\nfootpath from Maine to Georgia.\\n11 With the support of \\nthe Forest Service, the George Washington and Jeffer-\\nson national forests and six other national forests \\nalong the Appalachians have included segments of the \\nTrail since its beginning. The National Park Service \\n(\\\"Park Service\\\") supported Trail construction in Shen-\\nandoah and Great Smoky Mountains national parks. \\n Groups of private volunteers, including numerous \\nhiking and outdoor recreation-oriented clubs along the eastern seaboard, took responsibility for construction \\n \\n 10 MVP ROD 27. \\n 11 See Nat'l Park Serv., U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Trails for \\nAmerica: Report on the  Nationwide Trail Study 32-33 (1966) (\\\" Trails \\nfor America \\\"), https://www.nps.gov/noco /learn/management/upload/ \\ntrails-for-america-1966.pdf.  \\n6 \\n and maintenance of local trail segments.12 The Forest \\nService and the Park Service dedicated significant \\neffort to trail-building under various Depression-era \\npublic works programs.13 By the time the Trail was \\ncompleted in 1937, more than 700 miles of the 2,200-\\nmile footpath had been constructed on federal lands, \\nmostly national forests. The majority of the newly com-pleted Appalachian Trail, however, remained on pri-\\nvate or state lands.\\n14 \\n The Park Service and the Forest Service were both \\nproponents of the Trail throughout its construction \\nand worked cooperatively to ensure maintenance and protection of the Trail after its completion.\\n15 Despite \\nthe federal land managers' important roles, most re-\\nsponsibility for trail management remained with the local trail clubs.\\n16 \\n \\n 12 Trails for America , 32-33; see generally  Appalachian Trail \\nConservancy, The Appalachian Trail: Celebrating America's \\nHiking Trail  15-38 (2012). \\n 13 Sally K.

See Light v. United States , 220 U.S. 523, 536-\\n37 (1911) (upholding federal government's authority to \\nestablish forest reserves a dministered by Secretary of \\nAgriculture). As this Court stated over a century ago, \\\"it is not for the courts to say how\\\" the national forests \\nand the nation's public land s \\\"shall be administered. \\nThat is for Congress to determine.\\\" Id. \\n By holding that the Appalachian Trail segment \\ncrossed by Atlantic consists of \\\"lands in the National \\nPark System,\\\" Pet. App. 55a, 57a (No. 18-1584), the \\nFourth Circuit not only misapplied the plain language \\nof the law, but also usurped Congress's exclusive con-stitutional prerogative to allocate among federal de-\\npartments jurisdiction over federal lands. The Fourth \\nCircuit erroneously conflated the Trail-related coordi-nation and administrative role that Congress assigned \\nto the Secretary of the In terior\\u2014and which the Secre-\\ntary later delegated to the Park Service\\u2014with the comprehensive land management and jurisdictional \\nresponsibility Congress assigned to the Secretary of \\nAgriculture, acting through the Forest Service. \\n The Fourth Circuit's decision directly contradicts \\nthe Trails Act's recognition that the federal agency ad-ministering the lands over which a national trail \\npasses may be different than the agency charged to \\n10 \\n administer that trail. It also contradicts Congress's \\nWeeks Act mandate that th e national forest lands \\ncrossed by MVP and Atlantic would be \\\"permanently \\nreserved, held and administered as national forest ,\\\" \\nnot national park , lands. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 521 (emphasis \\nadded). \\n The Forest Service and Park Service had for over \\n50 years prior to the circuit court's decision consist-\\nently interpreted the Trails Act to not alter the Forest Service's jurisdiction. Congre ss chose to promote inter-\\nagency and stakeholder coordination, but did so in a \\nway that maintained the Department of Agriculture's jurisdiction. Congress never designated the strips of \\nnational forest lands used by  the Trail as national park \\nlands. Congress simply assigned to the Interior Secre-tary the responsibility to acquire lands and coordinate \\namong the government agencies and trail clubs in-\\nvolved in managing various Trail segments. \\n--------------------------------- \\uf0a8 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nREASONS WHY THE \\nPETITIONS SHOULD BE GRANTED  \\n Rather than applying the plain text of the Trails \\nAct, which would harmonize it with the Weeks Act, the Fourth Circuit's decision found conflict where there is \\nnone. The Fourth Circuit's opinion usurps Congress's \\nplenary Property Clause power and imposes a result that conflicts with a half-century of agency practice. \\nSee Pet. at 24-25 (No. 18-1587); Pet. at 19-21 (No. \\n18-1584). The Fourth Circuit's decision contradicts \\n11 \\n the plain language of the W eeks Act and Trails Act and \\nCongress's consistent record of careful, deliberate sys-\\ntematizing of departmental jurisdiction over public \\nlands. Congress has been especially deliberate when deciding how to assign jurisdiction over public forest \\nlands between national forests and national parks. Na-\\ntional forests are managed for utilitarian, \\\"multiple use\\\" purposes. National parks are managed for preser-\\nvation. \\n The Fourth Circuit's erroneous interpretation, if \\nnot addressed by this Court, will create broad un-\\ncertainty over public l ands management and impose \\nsignificant risks on Atlantic, MVP, and existing and \\nplanned energy infrastructure well beyond the sites, \\nprojects, and parties involved here. The Mineral Leas-ing Act provides the principal federal authority for \\ngranting oil and gas pipeline rights-of-way on federal \\npublic lands. The Forest Service emphasizes correctly that the Trail-crossing issue is the only aspect of the \\ndecision below that cannot be addressed by further \\nagency analysis, factual review, public notice and com-ment, or clarification. See Pet. 13-14 (No. 18-1584). This \\ncritical point applies equally to MVP. If allowed to \\nstand, the decision below eliminates federal MLA au-thority to grant or renew rights-of-way for gas pipe-\\nlines serving the millions of  Americans living along the \\neastern seaboard if the pipeline crosses the Trail, a court-erected barrier from central Maine to north \\nGeorgia. \\n  \\n12 \\n I. The Appalachian Tr ail Segment Crossed \\nBy The ACP Project Is Not \\\"Land In The \\nNational Park System\\\" Under The Mineral Leasing Act. \\n The Forest Service used its management discre-\\ntion eight decades ago to approve and assist with con-\\nstruction of the footpath, sign s, and shelters on national \\nforest lands to help create the Appalachian Trail. But \\nit did not transfer the lands traversed by that footpath \\nto the Park Service. Neither did the Trails Act. \\n At times, the Park Service has characterized the \\nAppalachian Trail as a unit of the National Park Sys-tem for its internal labeling purposes. See, e.g., Pet. \\nApp. 55a (No. 18-1584). And so me segments of the Trail \\nare on lands inside national parks. But there is no ba-sis in the law for concluding that the entire 2,200-mile \\nfootpath has been transformed into \\\"lands in the Na-\\ntional Park System\\\" by a label. See 54 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 100102, \\n100501. The term is a conven ient administrative catch-\\nall, evident in the fact that Park System \\\"units\\\" often \\ninclude areas of non-federal ownership or areas under other agencies' jurisdictions. The Trail corridor con-\\ntains a variety of areas administered by state and fed-\\neral agencies and local entities.\\n20 \\n The Trail at the locations to be crossed by Atlantic \\nand MVP is a congressional ov erlay of a trails system \\nuse and footpath on national forest land, but it does not \\nchange the character or juris diction of that land. The \\n \\n 20 Nat'l Parks Conservation Ass'n, Appalachian National \\nScenic Trail: A Special Report  3 (March 2010). \\n13 \\n place remains national forest land. The inter-agency \\nand stakeholder cooperation for the Trail coordinated \\nby the Secretary of the Interior is a procedural re-\\nquirement of the Trails Ac t, not a reallocation of \\nland management jurisdiction from the Department of \\nAgriculture to the Department of the Interior. \\n \\nA. Statutory Background. \\n1. The National Forest System. \\n In 1891, Congress authorized the President to \\\"set \\napart and reserve . . . public land bearing forests . . . as \\npublic reservations.\\\" Forest Reserve Act of 1891, ch. \\n561, \\u00a7 24, 26 Stat. 1103 (codif ied at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 471 \\n(repealed 1976)). In the Organic Administration Act \\nof 1897, Congress provided that \\\"[n]o national forest \\nshall be established, except to improve and protect the forest within the boundaries, or for the purpose of \\nsecuring favorable conditions of water flows, and to \\nfurnish a continuous supply of timber.\\\" Organic Ad-ministration Act of 1897, ch. 2, \\u00a7 1, 30 Stat. 34 (codi-\\nfied at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 475). In 1905, Congress transferred \\njurisdiction over the national forests from the Depart-ment of the Interior to the Department of Agriculture. \\nForest Transfer Act of 1905, ch. 288, \\u00a7 1, 33 Stat. 628 \\n(codified as amended at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 472). The Forest Transfer Act directs that \\\"the Department of Agricul-\\nture shall execute . . . all laws affecting public lands \\nheretofore or hereafter reserved\\\" as forest reserves under the 1891 Act. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 472. These acts, ini-\\ntially focused on public lands in the western United \\n14 \\n States, established the foundation of the current na-\\ntional forest system. See 36 C.F.R. \\u00a7 200.3(b)(2). \\n The 1911 Weeks Act then authorized the Secretary \\nof Agriculture to acquire pri vate lands to establish na-\\ntional forests in the eastern United States. Act of Mar. \\n1, 1911, ch. 186, \\u00a7 9, 36 Stat. 962, \\u00a7 6 (codified at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 515).\\n21 Congress also directed that those lands \\nbe \\\"permanently reserved, held, and administered as \\nnational forest lands under the provisions of \\\" the 1891 Act as supplemented. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 521; see also id . \\n\\u00a7 521a. Both the George Washington and Jefferson na-\\ntional forests were among th e first national forests es-\\ntablished pursuant to these authorities.\\n22 \\n From the beginning, national forests were to be \\nmanaged for \\\"multiple use,\\\" diverse public purposes \\nincluding commercial activi ties such as timber har-\\nvest, mining, grazing, and energy development. See, \\ne.g., United States v. New Mexico , 438 U.S. 696, 706-09 \\n& n.18 (1978); United States v. Grimaud , 220 U.S. 506, \\n515 (1911); Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960, 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 528-531; Charles F. Wilkinson & H. \\n \\n 21 See also  Harold K. Steen, The U.S. Forest Service: A His-\\ntory 122-29 (1976) (history of the Weeks Act). \\n 22 See Proclamation No. 1448, 40 Stat. 1779 (1918) (estab-\\nlishing the Shenandoah National Forest); Exec. Order No. 5867 (June 28, 1932) (renaming the Shenandoah National Forest the George Washington National Forest); Proclamation No. 2165, 1 Fed. Reg. 227, 227-29 (Apr. 24, 1936) (establishing the Jefferson \\nNational Forest); see also  Forest Serv., U.S. Dep't of Agric., George \\nWashington National Forest: A History  11, 15 (1993), https://www. \\nfs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOC UMENTS/stelprd3832787.pdf. \\n15 \\n Michael Anderson, Land and Resource Planning in the \\nNational Forests , 64 Or. L. Rev. 1, 20-23, 53-60 (1985). \\n Congress has adjusted the Forest Service's mis-\\nsion over time, but the mission has always included the \\nresponsibility to use the agency's wide discretion to \\nmake land and resource decisions that balance among various, often competing uses. When Congress decides \\nto require the Forest Service to depart from multiple-\\nuse principles in order to exclude forest lands from commercial uses, Congress does so by specific direc-\\ntion, for instance by designat ing that certain areas be \\nmanaged as national forest wilderness, including vari-ous locations that include the Trail footpath,\\n23 none of \\nwhich are crossed by Atlantic or MVP. \\n \\n2. The National Park System.  \\n Congress established the National Park System to \\npreserve, not develop, federal lands and resources. The \\nPark Service's preservation mission is very different from the Forest Service's utilitarian mission.\\n24 In 1916, \\n \\n 23 E.g., Act of Nov. 9, 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-471, 114 Stat. \\n2057 (designating the Priest Wilderness Area in Virginia); Act of Oct. 30, 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-586, 98 Stat. 3105 (designating the Thunder Ridge, Mountain Lake , Peters Mountain, Beartown, \\nLittle Wilson Creek, Lewis Fork, Priest Wilderness Areas in Virginia). \\n \\n24 See, e.g., Joseph L. Sax, Mountains Without Handrails, Re-\\nflections on the National Parks  5-9 (1980) (describing early history \\nand development of federal national parks policy); see generally  \\nJohn Ise, Our National Park Policy: A Critical History  185-95 \\n(1961) (history of national park policy during the period preceding and accompanying completion of the Appalachian Trail); Elmo R. \\n \\n16 \\n Congress provided that the \\\"fundamental purposes of \\nthe said parks, monuments, and reservations . . . is to \\nconserve the scenery and the natural and historic ob-\\njects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same . . . unimpaired for the enjoy-\\nment of future generations.\\\" Nat'l Park Serv. Organic \\nAct of 1916, ch. 408, \\u00a7 1, 39 Stat. 535 (codified as \\namended at 54 U.S.C. \\u00a7 100101). \\n National park lands are to be preserved and, where \\npossible, enjoyed. But for the national forests, Con-\\ngress has long emphasized t hat \\\"there must always be \\n. . . as primary objects and purposes the utilitarian use of land, of water, and of timber, as contributing to the \\nwealth of all the people.\\\" H.R . Rep. No. 64-700, at 3 (1916). \\n \\n3. The National Trails System.  \\n The National Trails System Act seeks \\\"to promote \\nthe preservation of, public a ccess to, travel within, and \\nenjoyment and appreciation of the open-air, outdoor areas and historic resources of the Nation.\\\" 16 U.S.C. \\n\\u00a7 1241(a). The Trails Act authorized the creation of a \\nNational Trail System comprised of the national his-toric trails, national recreation trails, and national sce-\\nnic trails.

The Act delegated re-\\nsponsibility to coordinate administration of the Appa-\\nlachian Trail to the Secretary of the Interior and gave \\nthe Secretary of Agriculture equivalent responsibility for the Pacific Crest Trail. Congress did not change the \\njurisdictional status of the lands over which the trails \\ncross. As Professor Fairfax explained, \\\"[i]rrespective of which Secretary has overa ll responsibility for a trail \\n[under the Trails Act], the Sec retary of the Interior is \\nin charge when a trail crosses Park or Bureau of Land Management lands and the Secr etary of Agriculture is \\nresponsible for management when a trail crosses For-\\nest Service land.\\\"\\n25 \\n The Trails Act recognizes that a federal agency \\nother than the agency charged with the overall ad-ministration of a trail may have authority and re-\\nsponsibility for the administration of the lands  over \\nwhich the trail traverses. The latter retains its author-ity to administer those l ands despite the trail's pres-\\nence. The statute is unambigu ous: \\\"Nothing . . . shall \\nbe deemed to transfer among Federal agencies any management responsibilities established under any \\nother law for federally admi nistered lands which are \\ncomponents of the National Trails System.\\\" See 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 1246(a)(1)(A). \\n \\n \\n 25 Fairfax, Federal-State Cooperation , supra note 13, at 58; \\nsee also Cong.

When Congress Transfers Administrative \\nJurisdiction From The Agriculture De-\\npartment's Forest Service And The Inte-\\nrior Department's Park  Service, It Does \\nSo Explicitly. \\n The structure of the Trails  Act consistently reflects \\nCongress's intent that federal agency land manage-\\nment jurisdiction be left undisturbed. The \\\"Secretary \\ncharged with the administration of a national scenic . . . trail may relocate segments of a national scenic . . . \\ntrail right-of-way,\\\" but only \\\" with the concurrence of \\nthe head of the Federal agency having jurisdiction over the lands involved .\\\" 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1246(b) (emphasis \\nadded). The Secretary \\\"may issue regulations,\\\" but \\nonly \\\" with the concurrence of the heads of any other \\nFederal agencies administering lands through which a \\n. . . national scenic . . . trail passes .\\\" Id. \\u00a7 1246(i) (em-\\nphasis added). \\n Congress elsewhere consistently has been explicit \\nwhen it intends to transfe r jurisdiction from one fed-\\neral agency to ano ther. On the same day he signed the \\nTrails Act, President John son signed legislation es-\\ntablishing North Cascades National Park. That con-\\ntemporaneous legislation expressly transferred the \\nadministrative jurisdiction of lands from the national \\nforest system to the National Park System: \\nFederal property within the boundaries of the \\npark and recreation areas is hereby trans-ferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the \\nSecretary [of the Interior] for administration \\nby him as part of the park and recreation \\n19 \\n areas. The national forest land within such \\nboundaries is hereby eliminated from the na-\\ntional forests within which it was heretofore \\nlocated.  \\nAct of Jan. 15, 1968, Pub. L. No. 90-544, 82 Stat. 926 \\n(codified at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 90b(a)) (emphasis added).26 \\n Similarly, when establishing Great Basin National \\nPark some years later, Cong ress specified that \\\"[l]ands \\nand waters . . . within the boundaries of the park which \\nwere administered by the Forest Service . . . prior to \\n[the date of enactment of this Act] are hereby trans-ferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secre-\\ntary [of the Interior].\\\" 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 410mm-2; see also 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 192b-9 (boundary adjustments for Rocky Mountain National Park). \\n Two examples from the Appalachian Trail area \\nfurther demonstrate that when Congress puts land \\ninto a national park system unit, it says so. See 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 403k-1 (\\\"Subject to valid existing rights, all lands within the boundaries of Great Smoky Moun-\\ntains National Park . . . hereafter shall be a part of the \\n \\n 26 In President Johnson's remarks on signing the Trails Act, \\nhe stated that \\\"[o]ur history of wise management of America's na-tional forests has assisted us in designating the initial elements of the National Trails System. . . . : the Appalachian Trail and the \\nPacific Crest Trail.\\\" Presidential Remarks Upon Signing Four Bills Relating to Conservation and Outdoor Recreation, 2 Pub. Papers 1000, 1001 (Oct. 2, 1968). H ad the Trails Act involved an \\nextensive jurisdictional transfer of national forest system land to the Park Service for the Appalachian Trail, it would have been unusual for the President to invoke the history of America's na-\\ntional forest  management as an impetus for designating the Trail. \\n20 \\n national park and shall be subject to all laws, rules, \\nand regulations applicable to the national park.\\\"); 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 403-3 (\\\"Subject to valid existing rights, the \\nlands and interests in lands which comprise section 1-A of the Blue Ridge Parkway . . . are excluded from the \\nparkway, made a part of the Shenandoah National \\nPark, and shall be administer ed in accordance with the \\nAct of August 25, 1916 (39 Stat. 535; 16 U.S.C. 1-4).\\\"). \\n Such jurisdictional transfer language is conspicu-\\nously absent from the Trails Act. Simply put, had Con-\\ngress intended to convert the Trail corridor lands into \\nlands of the National Park System, it would have said so. Any uncertainty over the significance of the absence \\nof transfer language should have been put to rest by \\nthe fact that the Trails Act lacks any of the other or-ganizational provisions that might reasonably be ex-\\npected to accompany a major change in allocation of \\nexecutive branch responsibilities across eight national forests in a fourteen-state region. The Trails Act makes \\nno mention of budget authority, personnel and prop-\\nerty reassignment, transition  schedule or process, re-\\nassignment of permits or easements. Indeed, the Trails \\nAct does not mention the Park Service except for the \\npurpose of maintaining a Trail map. See Whitman v. \\nAm. Trucking Ass'n , 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001) (\\\"Con-\\ngress . . . does not alter the fundamental details of a \\nregulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provi-sions\\u2014it does not, one might say, hide elephants in \\nmouseholes.\\\"). \\n Three other considerations strongly reinforce the \\nconclusion that the circuit court erred in interpreting \\n21 \\n the Trails Act. First , Congress had rejected at least \\neight proposals to transfer the national forests to the \\nInterior Department in the years preceding enactment \\nof the Trails Act, and it is highly unlikely that it would \\nhave transferred national forest lands sub silentio .27 \\nSecond , Congress has given significant consideration \\nto the question whether the relevant portions of the George Washington and Jefferson national forests \\ndeserved enhanced protection  from commercial develop-\\nment and has chosen not to do so, thus strongly indicat-ing that Congress would not have done indirectly by \\nimplication what it has de clined to do directly.\\n28 Third , \\n \\n 27 Ross W.

Had Congress sought to change \\nthe federal approval process for gas pipelines inter-\\nsecting the path of the Trail, it would have said some-thing, especially if the in tended change amounted to a \\nprohibition of federal rights-of-way. \\n \\nII. The Circuit Court's Holding Conflicts With \\nThis Court's Decisions On Harmonizing Potentially Confli cting Statutes. \\n The Fourth Circuit was faced with reconciling the \\nTrails Act with the Weeks Act to determine the ap-\\nplicability of the Mineral Leasing Act. The court mis-characterized the Trails Act in a way that presented an \\napparent conflict with the Weeks Act, which in turn vi-\\ntiated the Mineral Leasing Act. The court made no \\n \\nof 1964, 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1131-1136. See, e.g., Act of Oct. 30, 1984, \\nPub. L. No. 98-586, 98 Stat. 3105 (designating the Thunder Ridge, Mountain Lake, Peters Mountain, Beartown, Little Wilson Creek, \\nLewis Fork, Priest Wi lderness Areas in Virg inia). Congress has \\nnever found that the national forest lands proposed to be used for the Atlantic or MVP below-grade Trail crossings warrant wilder-ness protection. \\n \\n29 A 1968 map prepared by the Federal Power Commission, \\nFERC's predecessor agency charged with implementation of the Natural Gas Act, shows multiple major gas pipelines in the area \\nof the Trail. That map is included as Attachment A. Attachment B shows the approximate route of the Trail superimposed on the map by amicus  Mountain Valley using contemporary geographic \\ninformation system data for the Trail's current route. \\n23 \\n effort to interpret the Weeks Act in concert with the \\nTrails Act. By failing to even try to reconcile and har-\\nmonize the statutes, the Fourth Circuit transformed \\n\\\"from expounder[ ] of what the law is into policy-\\nmaker[ ] choosing what the law should be .\\\" Epic Sys. \\nCorp. v. Lewis , 138 S. Ct. 1612, 1624 (2018). \\n When \\\"confronted with two Acts of Congress alleg-\\nedly touching on the same topic, this Court is not at \\n'liberty to pick and choose among congressional enact-ments' and must instead strive 'to give effect to both.' \\\" \\nId. (quoting Morton v. Mancari , 417 U.S. 535, 551 \\n(1974)). The project challengers below bore a \\\"heavy burden\\\"\\u2014that was never met or even considered by \\nthe circuit court\\u2014to show that Congress implicitly dis-\\nplaced the controlling national forest-administration statutes through the 1968 Trails Act. See id . \\n The circuit court simply presumed  that the entire \\nalmost 2,200-mile long Trail corridor is land in the \\n\\\"National Park System\\\" because the Trail was generi-\\ncally referenced in the record as a \\\" 'unit' of the Na-tional Park System.\\\" Pet. App. 55a (No. 18-1584). But \\na shorthand labeling reference, useful to agency staff \\nresponding to an internal Interior Department delega-tion of responsibility to implement the Trails Act, does \\nnot itself transfer administration of all lands within \\nthe Trail corridor to the Park Service, change the language of the Trails Act, or even modify the Park \\nService's own longstanding administrative interpreta-\\ntion, application, and understanding of the Trails Act as reflected in the agency's management documents \\nand consistent practice. See FCC v. Fox TV Stations , \\n24 \\n 556 U.S. 502, 513-16 (2009); see also  Pet. at 24-25 (No. \\n18-1587); Pet. at 19-21 (No. 18-1584). \\n The circuit court's approach results in an implau-\\nsible reading of the Trails Act. Extending the Fourth \\nCircuit's reasoning to other national scenic trails, such \\nas the Continental Divide Trail, where the Trails Act assigns to the Secretary of Agriculture the trail-admin-\\nistration role, see 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1244(a)(5), would convert \\nnarrow strips of Yellowstone, Glacier, and Rocky Moun-tain national parks into national forests without any \\ncongressional action. The same would hold true for the \\nfive other national scenic or historic trails adminis-tered by the Forest Service, many of which also trav-\\nerse national park system lands.\\n30 Numerous other \\nnational scenic and historic trails are administered by \\nthe Park Service.

As approved by the Forest Service and FERC, \\nMVP would cross under the Trail footpath on the for-ested ridge marking the Virginia-West Virginia border, \\nwest of Roanoke, Virginia. The Forest Service required \\nMountain Valley to construct a 600-foot-long bore roughly 80 feet beneath the ridgetop and Trail. By \\nplacing the pipeline at this  depth, the Forest Service \\npreserved a football field- length (300-foot) forested \\nbuffer to each side of the Trail. Drilling equipment \\nwould temporarily be placed in pits downslope and not \\nvisible from the Trail. All construction-related impacts, \\n \\nworked for decades to obtain permanent protection for the en-\\ntirety of the Trail. However, th e uncertainty resulting from the \\nFourth Circuit's decision regard ing agency jurisdiction has cre-\\nated a further obstacle to comple ting a land exchange that would \\nprotect the Trail while providing a right-of-way for MVP. \\n 9 See MVP FEIS \\u00a7 3.0; MVP ROD 23-27.  \\n5 \\n such as noise, would be temporary, and no construction \\nwould occur on the footpath.10 \\n The Forest Service and BLM were well on their \\nway to addressing the Fourth Circuit's remand regard-\\ning MVP's approvals to cross the Jefferson National \\nForest when the Fourth Circuit issued the decision be-low. Mountain Valley was not a party to that proceed-\\ning, but the decision had the same practical effect for \\nMVP as it did for Atlantic\\u2014no federal agency could lawfully issue an MLA right-of-way to either pipeline \\nto cross the Trail on national forest lands. \\n 2.  The Appalachian Trail was conceived by pri-\\nvate individuals and hiking clubs in the 1920s as a \\nfootpath from Maine to Georgia.\\n11 With the support of \\nthe Forest Service, the George Washington and Jeffer-\\nson national forests and six other national forests \\nalong the Appalachians have included segments of the \\nTrail since its beginning. The National Park Service \\n(\\\"Park Service\\\") supported Trail construction in Shen-\\nandoah and Great Smoky Mountains national parks. \\n Groups of private volunteers, including numerous \\nhiking and outdoor recreation-oriented clubs along the eastern seaboard, took responsibility for construction \\n \\n 10 MVP ROD 27. \\n 11 See Nat'l Park Serv., U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Trails for \\nAmerica: Report on the  Nationwide Trail Study 32-33 (1966) (\\\" Trails \\nfor America \\\"), https://www.nps.gov/noco /learn/management/upload/ \\ntrails-for-america-1966.pdf.  \\n6 \\n and maintenance of local trail segments.12 The Forest \\nService and the Park Service dedicated significant \\neffort to trail-building under various Depression-era \\npublic works programs.13 By the time the Trail was \\ncompleted in 1937, more than 700 miles of the 2,200-\\nmile footpath had been constructed on federal lands, \\nmostly national forests. The majority of the newly com-pleted Appalachian Trail, however, remained on pri-\\nvate or state lands.\\n14 \\n The Park Service and the Forest Service were both \\nproponents of the Trail throughout its construction \\nand worked cooperatively to ensure maintenance and protection of the Trail after its completion.\\n15 Despite \\nthe federal land managers' important roles, most re-\\nsponsibility for trail management remained with the local trail clubs.\\n16 \\n \\n 12 Trails for America , 32-33; see generally  Appalachian Trail \\nConservancy, The Appalachian Trail: Celebrating America's \\nHiking Trail  15-38 (2012). \\n 13 Sally K.

See Light v. United States , 220 U.S. 523, 536-\\n37 (1911) (upholding federal government's authority to \\nestablish forest reserves a dministered by Secretary of \\nAgriculture). As this Court stated over a century ago, \\\"it is not for the courts to say how\\\" the national forests \\nand the nation's public land s \\\"shall be administered. \\nThat is for Congress to determine.\\\" Id. \\n By holding that the Appalachian Trail segment \\ncrossed by Atlantic consists of \\\"lands in the National \\nPark System,\\\" Pet. App. 55a, 57a (No. 18-1584), the \\nFourth Circuit not only misapplied the plain language \\nof the law, but also usurped Congress's exclusive con-stitutional prerogative to allocate among federal de-\\npartments jurisdiction over federal lands. The Fourth \\nCircuit erroneously conflated the Trail-related coordi-nation and administrative role that Congress assigned \\nto the Secretary of the In terior\\u2014and which the Secre-\\ntary later delegated to the Park Service\\u2014with the comprehensive land management and jurisdictional \\nresponsibility Congress assigned to the Secretary of \\nAgriculture, acting through the Forest Service. \\n The Fourth Circuit's decision directly contradicts \\nthe Trails Act's recognition that the federal agency ad-ministering the lands over which a national trail \\npasses may be different than the agency charged to \\n10 \\n administer that trail. It also contradicts Congress's \\nWeeks Act mandate that th e national forest lands \\ncrossed by MVP and Atlantic would be \\\"permanently \\nreserved, held and administered as national forest ,\\\" \\nnot national park , lands. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 521 (emphasis \\nadded). \\n The Forest Service and Park Service had for over \\n50 years prior to the circuit court's decision consist-\\nently interpreted the Trails Act to not alter the Forest Service's jurisdiction. Congre ss chose to promote inter-\\nagency and stakeholder coordination, but did so in a \\nway that maintained the Department of Agriculture's jurisdiction. Congress never designated the strips of \\nnational forest lands used by  the Trail as national park \\nlands. Congress simply assigned to the Interior Secre-tary the responsibility to acquire lands and coordinate \\namong the government agencies and trail clubs in-\\nvolved in managing various Trail segments. \\n--------------------------------- \\uf0a8 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nREASONS WHY THE \\nPETITIONS SHOULD BE GRANTED  \\n Rather than applying the plain text of the Trails \\nAct, which would harmonize it with the Weeks Act, the Fourth Circuit's decision found conflict where there is \\nnone. The Fourth Circuit's opinion usurps Congress's \\nplenary Property Clause power and imposes a result that conflicts with a half-century of agency practice. \\nSee Pet. at 24-25 (No. 18-1587); Pet. at 19-21 (No. \\n18-1584). The Fourth Circuit's decision contradicts \\n11 \\n the plain language of the W eeks Act and Trails Act and \\nCongress's consistent record of careful, deliberate sys-\\ntematizing of departmental jurisdiction over public \\nlands. Congress has been especially deliberate when deciding how to assign jurisdiction over public forest \\nlands between national forests and national parks. Na-\\ntional forests are managed for utilitarian, \\\"multiple use\\\" purposes. National parks are managed for preser-\\nvation. \\n The Fourth Circuit's erroneous interpretation, if \\nnot addressed by this Court, will create broad un-\\ncertainty over public l ands management and impose \\nsignificant risks on Atlantic, MVP, and existing and \\nplanned energy infrastructure well beyond the sites, \\nprojects, and parties involved here. The Mineral Leas-ing Act provides the principal federal authority for \\ngranting oil and gas pipeline rights-of-way on federal \\npublic lands. The Forest Service emphasizes correctly that the Trail-crossing issue is the only aspect of the \\ndecision below that cannot be addressed by further \\nagency analysis, factual review, public notice and com-ment, or clarification. See Pet. 13-14 (No. 18-1584). This \\ncritical point applies equally to MVP. If allowed to \\nstand, the decision below eliminates federal MLA au-thority to grant or renew rights-of-way for gas pipe-\\nlines serving the millions of  Americans living along the \\neastern seaboard if the pipeline crosses the Trail, a court-erected barrier from central Maine to north \\nGeorgia. \\n  \\n12 \\n I. The Appalachian Tr ail Segment Crossed \\nBy The ACP Project Is Not \\\"Land In The \\nNational Park System\\\" Under The Mineral Leasing Act. \\n The Forest Service used its management discre-\\ntion eight decades ago to approve and assist with con-\\nstruction of the footpath, sign s, and shelters on national \\nforest lands to help create the Appalachian Trail. But \\nit did not transfer the lands traversed by that footpath \\nto the Park Service. Neither did the Trails Act. \\n At times, the Park Service has characterized the \\nAppalachian Trail as a unit of the National Park Sys-tem for its internal labeling purposes. See, e.g., Pet. \\nApp. 55a (No. 18-1584). And so me segments of the Trail \\nare on lands inside national parks. But there is no ba-sis in the law for concluding that the entire 2,200-mile \\nfootpath has been transformed into \\\"lands in the Na-\\ntional Park System\\\" by a label. See 54 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 100102, \\n100501. The term is a conven ient administrative catch-\\nall, evident in the fact that Park System \\\"units\\\" often \\ninclude areas of non-federal ownership or areas under other agencies' jurisdictions. The Trail corridor con-\\ntains a variety of areas administered by state and fed-\\neral agencies and local entities.\\n20 \\n The Trail at the locations to be crossed by Atlantic \\nand MVP is a congressional ov erlay of a trails system \\nuse and footpath on national forest land, but it does not \\nchange the character or juris diction of that land. The \\n \\n 20 Nat'l Parks Conservation Ass'n, Appalachian National \\nScenic Trail: A Special Report  3 (March 2010). \\n13 \\n place remains national forest land. The inter-agency \\nand stakeholder cooperation for the Trail coordinated \\nby the Secretary of the Interior is a procedural re-\\nquirement of the Trails Ac t, not a reallocation of \\nland management jurisdiction from the Department of \\nAgriculture to the Department of the Interior. \\n \\nA. Statutory Background. \\n1. The National Forest System. \\n In 1891, Congress authorized the President to \\\"set \\napart and reserve . . . public land bearing forests . . . as \\npublic reservations.\\\" Forest Reserve Act of 1891, ch. \\n561, \\u00a7 24, 26 Stat. 1103 (codif ied at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 471 \\n(repealed 1976)). In the Organic Administration Act \\nof 1897, Congress provided that \\\"[n]o national forest \\nshall be established, except to improve and protect the forest within the boundaries, or for the purpose of \\nsecuring favorable conditions of water flows, and to \\nfurnish a continuous supply of timber.\\\" Organic Ad-ministration Act of 1897, ch. 2, \\u00a7 1, 30 Stat. 34 (codi-\\nfied at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 475). In 1905, Congress transferred \\njurisdiction over the national forests from the Depart-ment of the Interior to the Department of Agriculture. \\nForest Transfer Act of 1905, ch. 288, \\u00a7 1, 33 Stat. 628 \\n(codified as amended at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 472). The Forest Transfer Act directs that \\\"the Department of Agricul-\\nture shall execute . . . all laws affecting public lands \\nheretofore or hereafter reserved\\\" as forest reserves under the 1891 Act. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 472. These acts, ini-\\ntially focused on public lands in the western United \\n14 \\n States, established the foundation of the current na-\\ntional forest system. See 36 C.F.R. \\u00a7 200.3(b)(2). \\n The 1911 Weeks Act then authorized the Secretary \\nof Agriculture to acquire pri vate lands to establish na-\\ntional forests in the eastern United States. Act of Mar. \\n1, 1911, ch. 186, \\u00a7 9, 36 Stat. 962, \\u00a7 6 (codified at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 515).\\n21 Congress also directed that those lands \\nbe \\\"permanently reserved, held, and administered as \\nnational forest lands under the provisions of \\\" the 1891 Act as supplemented. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 521; see also id . \\n\\u00a7 521a. Both the George Washington and Jefferson na-\\ntional forests were among th e first national forests es-\\ntablished pursuant to these authorities.\\n22 \\n From the beginning, national forests were to be \\nmanaged for \\\"multiple use,\\\" diverse public purposes \\nincluding commercial activi ties such as timber har-\\nvest, mining, grazing, and energy development. See, \\ne.g., United States v. New Mexico , 438 U.S. 696, 706-09 \\n& n.18 (1978); United States v. Grimaud , 220 U.S. 506, \\n515 (1911); Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960, 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 528-531; Charles F. Wilkinson & H. \\n \\n 21 See also  Harold K. Steen, The U.S. Forest Service: A His-\\ntory 122-29 (1976) (history of the Weeks Act). \\n 22 See Proclamation No. 1448, 40 Stat. 1779 (1918) (estab-\\nlishing the Shenandoah National Forest); Exec. Order No. 5867 (June 28, 1932) (renaming the Shenandoah National Forest the George Washington National Forest); Proclamation No. 2165, 1 Fed. Reg. 227, 227-29 (Apr. 24, 1936) (establishing the Jefferson \\nNational Forest); see also  Forest Serv., U.S. Dep't of Agric., George \\nWashington National Forest: A History  11, 15 (1993), https://www. \\nfs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOC UMENTS/stelprd3832787.pdf. \\n15 \\n Michael Anderson, Land and Resource Planning in the \\nNational Forests , 64 Or. L. Rev. 1, 20-23, 53-60 (1985). \\n Congress has adjusted the Forest Service's mis-\\nsion over time, but the mission has always included the \\nresponsibility to use the agency's wide discretion to \\nmake land and resource decisions that balance among various, often competing uses. When Congress decides \\nto require the Forest Service to depart from multiple-\\nuse principles in order to exclude forest lands from commercial uses, Congress does so by specific direc-\\ntion, for instance by designat ing that certain areas be \\nmanaged as national forest wilderness, including vari-ous locations that include the Trail footpath,\\n23 none of \\nwhich are crossed by Atlantic or MVP. \\n \\n2. The National Park System.  \\n Congress established the National Park System to \\npreserve, not develop, federal lands and resources. The \\nPark Service's preservation mission is very different from the Forest Service's utilitarian mission.\\n24 In 1916, \\n \\n 23 E.g., Act of Nov. 9, 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-471, 114 Stat. \\n2057 (designating the Priest Wilderness Area in Virginia); Act of Oct. 30, 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-586, 98 Stat. 3105 (designating the Thunder Ridge, Mountain Lake , Peters Mountain, Beartown, \\nLittle Wilson Creek, Lewis Fork, Priest Wilderness Areas in Virginia). \\n \\n24 See, e.g., Joseph L. Sax, Mountains Without Handrails, Re-\\nflections on the National Parks  5-9 (1980) (describing early history \\nand development of federal national parks policy); see generally  \\nJohn Ise, Our National Park Policy: A Critical History  185-95 \\n(1961) (history of national park policy during the period preceding and accompanying completion of the Appalachian Trail); Elmo R. \\n \\n16 \\n Congress provided that the \\\"fundamental purposes of \\nthe said parks, monuments, and reservations . . . is to \\nconserve the scenery and the natural and historic ob-\\njects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same . . . unimpaired for the enjoy-\\nment of future generations.\\\" Nat'l Park Serv. Organic \\nAct of 1916, ch. 408, \\u00a7 1, 39 Stat. 535 (codified as \\namended at 54 U.S.C. \\u00a7 100101). \\n National park lands are to be preserved and, where \\npossible, enjoyed. But for the national forests, Con-\\ngress has long emphasized t hat \\\"there must always be \\n. . . as primary objects and purposes the utilitarian use of land, of water, and of timber, as contributing to the \\nwealth of all the people.\\\" H.R . Rep. No. 64-700, at 3 (1916). \\n \\n3. The National Trails System.  \\n The National Trails System Act seeks \\\"to promote \\nthe preservation of, public a ccess to, travel within, and \\nenjoyment and appreciation of the open-air, outdoor areas and historic resources of the Nation.\\\" 16 U.S.C. \\n\\u00a7 1241(a). The Trails Act authorized the creation of a \\nNational Trail System comprised of the national his-toric trails, national recreation trails, and national sce-\\nnic trails. Id. \\u00a7 1242(a). \\n The Trails Act designated the Appalachian Trail \\nand the Pacific Crest Trail as  the nation's first national \\n \\nRichardson, The Politics of Conservation: Crusades and Contro-\\nversies 1897-1913 , at 22-46 (1962) (history of formative public pol-\\nicy debates over assignment of departmental authority over federal forest lands). \\n17 \\n scenic trails. Id. \\u00a7 1244(a)(1). The Act delegated re-\\nsponsibility to coordinate administration of the Appa-\\nlachian Trail to the Secretary of the Interior and gave \\nthe Secretary of Agriculture equivalent responsibility for the Pacific Crest Trail. Congress did not change the \\njurisdictional status of the lands over which the trails \\ncross. As Professor Fairfax explained, \\\"[i]rrespective of which Secretary has overa ll responsibility for a trail \\n[under the Trails Act], the Sec retary of the Interior is \\nin charge when a trail crosses Park or Bureau of Land Management lands and the Secr etary of Agriculture is \\nresponsible for management when a trail crosses For-\\nest Service land.\\\"\\n25 \\n The Trails Act recognizes that a federal agency \\nother than the agency charged with the overall ad-ministration of a trail may have authority and re-\\nsponsibility for the administration of the lands  over \\nwhich the trail traverses. The latter retains its author-ity to administer those l ands despite the trail's pres-\\nence. The statute is unambigu ous: \\\"Nothing . . . shall \\nbe deemed to transfer among Federal agencies any management responsibilities established under any \\nother law for federally admi nistered lands which are \\ncomponents of the National Trails System.\\\" See 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 1246(a)(1)(A). \\n \\n \\n 25 Fairfax, Federal-State Cooperation , supra note 13, at 58; \\nsee also Cong. Research Serv., R43868, The National Trails Sys-\\ntem: A Brief Overview  6-7 (2015). \\n18 \\n B. When Congress Transfers Administrative \\nJurisdiction From The Agriculture De-\\npartment's Forest Service And The Inte-\\nrior Department's Park  Service, It Does \\nSo Explicitly. \\n The structure of the Trails  Act consistently reflects \\nCongress's intent that federal agency land manage-\\nment jurisdiction be left undisturbed. The \\\"Secretary \\ncharged with the administration of a national scenic . . . trail may relocate segments of a national scenic . . . \\ntrail right-of-way,\\\" but only \\\" with the concurrence of \\nthe head of the Federal agency having jurisdiction over the lands involved .\\\" 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1246(b) (emphasis \\nadded). The Secretary \\\"may issue regulations,\\\" but \\nonly \\\" with the concurrence of the heads of any other \\nFederal agencies administering lands through which a \\n. . . national scenic . . . trail passes .\\\" Id. \\u00a7 1246(i) (em-\\nphasis added). \\n Congress elsewhere consistently has been explicit \\nwhen it intends to transfe r jurisdiction from one fed-\\neral agency to ano ther. On the same day he signed the \\nTrails Act, President John son signed legislation es-\\ntablishing North Cascades National Park. That con-\\ntemporaneous legislation expressly transferred the \\nadministrative jurisdiction of lands from the national \\nforest system to the National Park System: \\nFederal property within the boundaries of the \\npark and recreation areas is hereby trans-ferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the \\nSecretary [of the Interior] for administration \\nby him as part of the park and recreation \\n19 \\n areas. The national forest land within such \\nboundaries is hereby eliminated from the na-\\ntional forests within which it was heretofore \\nlocated.  \\nAct of Jan. 15, 1968, Pub. L. No. 90-544, 82 Stat. 926 \\n(codified at 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 90b(a)) (emphasis added).26 \\n Similarly, when establishing Great Basin National \\nPark some years later, Cong ress specified that \\\"[l]ands \\nand waters . . . within the boundaries of the park which \\nwere administered by the Forest Service . . . prior to \\n[the date of enactment of this Act] are hereby trans-ferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secre-\\ntary [of the Interior].\\\" 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 410mm-2; see also 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 192b-9 (boundary adjustments for Rocky Mountain National Park). \\n Two examples from the Appalachian Trail area \\nfurther demonstrate that when Congress puts land \\ninto a national park system unit, it says so. See 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 403k-1 (\\\"Subject to valid existing rights, all lands within the boundaries of Great Smoky Moun-\\ntains National Park . . . hereafter shall be a part of the \\n \\n 26 In President Johnson's remarks on signing the Trails Act, \\nhe stated that \\\"[o]ur history of wise management of America's na-tional forests has assisted us in designating the initial elements of the National Trails System. . . . : the Appalachian Trail and the \\nPacific Crest Trail.\\\" Presidential Remarks Upon Signing Four Bills Relating to Conservation and Outdoor Recreation, 2 Pub. Papers 1000, 1001 (Oct. 2, 1968). H ad the Trails Act involved an \\nextensive jurisdictional transfer of national forest system land to the Park Service for the Appalachian Trail, it would have been unusual for the President to invoke the history of America's na-\\ntional forest  management as an impetus for designating the Trail. \\n20 \\n national park and shall be subject to all laws, rules, \\nand regulations applicable to the national park.\\\"); 16 \\nU.S.C. \\u00a7 403-3 (\\\"Subject to valid existing rights, the \\nlands and interests in lands which comprise section 1-A of the Blue Ridge Parkway . . . are excluded from the \\nparkway, made a part of the Shenandoah National \\nPark, and shall be administer ed in accordance with the \\nAct of August 25, 1916 (39 Stat. 535; 16 U.S.C. 1-4).\\\"). \\n Such jurisdictional transfer language is conspicu-\\nously absent from the Trails Act. Simply put, had Con-\\ngress intended to convert the Trail corridor lands into \\nlands of the National Park System, it would have said so. Any uncertainty over the significance of the absence \\nof transfer language should have been put to rest by \\nthe fact that the Trails Act lacks any of the other or-ganizational provisions that might reasonably be ex-\\npected to accompany a major change in allocation of \\nexecutive branch responsibilities across eight national forests in a fourteen-state region. The Trails Act makes \\nno mention of budget authority, personnel and prop-\\nerty reassignment, transition  schedule or process, re-\\nassignment of permits or easements. Indeed, the Trails \\nAct does not mention the Park Service except for the \\npurpose of maintaining a Trail map. See Whitman v. \\nAm. Trucking Ass'n , 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001) (\\\"Con-\\ngress . . . does not alter the fundamental details of a \\nregulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provi-sions\\u2014it does not, one might say, hide elephants in \\nmouseholes.\\\"). \\n Three other considerations strongly reinforce the \\nconclusion that the circuit court erred in interpreting \\n21 \\n the Trails Act. First , Congress had rejected at least \\neight proposals to transfer the national forests to the \\nInterior Department in the years preceding enactment \\nof the Trails Act, and it is highly unlikely that it would \\nhave transferred national forest lands sub silentio .27 \\nSecond , Congress has given significant consideration \\nto the question whether the relevant portions of the George Washington and Jefferson national forests \\ndeserved enhanced protection  from commercial develop-\\nment and has chosen not to do so, thus strongly indicat-ing that Congress would not have done indirectly by \\nimplication what it has de clined to do directly.\\n28 Third , \\n \\n 27 Ross W.

Research Serv., RL34772, Proposals \\nto Merge the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management: Issues and Approaches  CRS-14 (2008) (\\\"Proposals to transfer the \\nFS to DOI or the BLM to USDA, or to merge the FS and BLM (or \\nits predecessor), date back to 1911, and have been made under Presidents Taft, Harding, Hoover, Roosevelt, Truman, Eisen-hower, Nixon, Carter, and Clinto n. In an attempt to improve ad-\\nministration of the federal lands, President Reagan proposed a substantial exchange (consolidation) of lands and personnel be-tween the agencies, but even this more limited reorganization was prevented by Cong ress.\\\"); U.S. Gov't Accountability Off., \\nGAO-09-223, Federal Land Management: Observations on a Pos-\\nsible Move of the Forest Service in to the Department of the Interior  \\n56-61 (2009); see also  T.H. Watkins, Righteous Pilgrim:  The Life \\nand Times of Harold L. Ickes, 1874-1952 , at 556-61, 584-91 (1990) \\n(illustrative discussion of poli tical divisions during President \\nFranklin D. Roosevelt's administration related to potential trans-fer of national forest jurisdiction away from the Agriculture De-partment). \\n \\n28 Congress has considered the question whether the sections \\nof the Trail corridor at issue here merit special protection by the Forest Service. Congress has designated numerous sections of \\nGeorge Washington and Jefferson national forest  lands crossed \\nby the Appalachian Trail as wilderness under the Wilderness Act \\n \\n22 \\n numerous major interstate gas pipelines crossed the \\nlands used for the Trail at the time Congress approved \\nthe Trails Act.29 The interstate pipelines were then, as \\ntoday, subject to federal approval under the provisions of the Natural Gas Act. Had Congress sought to change \\nthe federal approval process for gas pipelines inter-\\nsecting the path of the Trail, it would have said some-thing, especially if the in tended change amounted to a \\nprohibition of federal rights-of-way. \\n \\nII. The Circuit Court's Holding Conflicts With \\nThis Court's Decisions On Harmonizing Potentially Confli cting Statutes. \\n The Fourth Circuit was faced with reconciling the \\nTrails Act with the Weeks Act to determine the ap-\\nplicability of the Mineral Leasing Act. The court mis-characterized the Trails Act in a way that presented an \\napparent conflict with the Weeks Act, which in turn vi-\\ntiated the Mineral Leasing Act. The court made no \\n \\nof 1964, 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1131-1136. See, e.g., Act of Oct. 30, 1984, \\nPub. L. No. 98-586, 98 Stat. 3105 (designating the Thunder Ridge, Mountain Lake, Peters Mountain, Beartown, Little Wilson Creek, \\nLewis Fork, Priest Wi lderness Areas in Virg inia). Congress has \\nnever found that the national forest lands proposed to be used for the Atlantic or MVP below-grade Trail crossings warrant wilder-ness protection. \\n \\n29 A 1968 map prepared by the Federal Power Commission, \\nFERC's predecessor agency charged with implementation of the Natural Gas Act, shows multiple major gas pipelines in the area \\nof the Trail. That map is included as Attachment A. Attachment B shows the approximate route of the Trail superimposed on the map by amicus  Mountain Valley using contemporary geographic \\ninformation system data for the Trail's current route. \\n23 \\n effort to interpret the Weeks Act in concert with the \\nTrails Act. By failing to even try to reconcile and har-\\nmonize the statutes, the Fourth Circuit transformed \\n\\\"from expounder[ ] of what the law is into policy-\\nmaker[ ] choosing what the law should be .\\\" Epic Sys. \\nCorp. v. Lewis , 138 S. Ct. 1612, 1624 (2018). \\n When \\\"confronted with two Acts of Congress alleg-\\nedly touching on the same topic, this Court is not at \\n'liberty to pick and choose among congressional enact-ments' and must instead strive 'to give effect to both.' \\\" \\nId. (quoting Morton v. Mancari , 417 U.S. 535, 551 \\n(1974)). The project challengers below bore a \\\"heavy burden\\\"\\u2014that was never met or even considered by \\nthe circuit court\\u2014to show that Congress implicitly dis-\\nplaced the controlling national forest-administration statutes through the 1968 Trails Act. See id . \\n The circuit court simply presumed  that the entire \\nalmost 2,200-mile long Trail corridor is land in the \\n\\\"National Park System\\\" because the Trail was generi-\\ncally referenced in the record as a \\\" 'unit' of the Na-tional Park System.\\\" Pet. App. 55a (No. 18-1584). But \\na shorthand labeling reference, useful to agency staff \\nresponding to an internal Interior Department delega-tion of responsibility to implement the Trails Act, does \\nnot itself transfer administration of all lands within \\nthe Trail corridor to the Park Service, change the language of the Trails Act, or even modify the Park \\nService's own longstanding administrative interpreta-\\ntion, application, and understanding of the Trails Act as reflected in the agency's management documents \\nand consistent practice. See FCC v. Fox TV Stations , \\n24 \\n 556 U.S. 502, 513-16 (2009); see also  Pet. at 24-25 (No. \\n18-1587); Pet. at 19-21 (No. 18-1584). \\n The circuit court's approach results in an implau-\\nsible reading of the Trails Act. Extending the Fourth \\nCircuit's reasoning to other national scenic trails, such \\nas the Continental Divide Trail, where the Trails Act assigns to the Secretary of Agriculture the trail-admin-\\nistration role, see 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1244(a)(5), would convert \\nnarrow strips of Yellowstone, Glacier, and Rocky Moun-tain national parks into national forests without any \\ncongressional action. The same would hold true for the \\nfive other national scenic or historic trails adminis-tered by the Forest Service, many of which also trav-\\nerse national park system lands.\\n30 Numerous other \\nnational scenic and historic trails are administered by \\nthe Park Service. The circuit court's decision, if applied \\nand followed nationwide, woul d elevate all those trails, \\n42,127 miles in all, to \\\"land in the National Park Sys-tem.\\\"\\n31 \\n--------------------------------- \\uf0a8 ---------------------------------  \\n \\n \\n 30 Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, Florida National Sce-\\nnic Trail, Nez Perce National Historic Trail, Arizona National Scenic Trail, and Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail. 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1244(a)(2), (13), (14), (27), (30). \\n \\n31 National Historic Trails , Nat'l Park Serv., https://www.nps. \\ngov/subjects/nationaltrailssystem/n ational-historic-trails.htm (last \\nvisited July 18, 2019).

      "  This case involves the intersection of three federal \n",

The National Forest System': '. \\n In 1891, Congress authorized the President to \"set \\napart and reserve . . . public land bearing forests . . . as \\npublic reservations.\" Forest Reserve Act of 1891, ch. \\n561, § 24, 26 Stat. 1103 (codif ied at 16 U.S.C. § 471 \\n(repealed 1976)). In the Organic Administration Act \\nof 1897, Congress provided that \"[n]o national forest \\nshall be established, except to improve and protect the forest within the boundaries, or for the purpose of \\nsecuring favorable conditions of water flows, and to \\nfurnish a continuous supply of timber.\" Organic Ad-ministration Act of 1897, ch. 2, § 1, 30 Stat. 34 (codi-\\nfied at 16 U.S.C. § 475). In 1905, Congress transferred \\njurisdiction over the national forests from the Depart-ment of the Interior to the Department of Agriculture. \\nForest Transfer Act of 1905, ch. 288, § 1, 33 Stat. 628 \\n(codified as amended at 16 U.S.C. § 472). The Forest Transfer Act directs that \"the Department of Agricul-\\nture shall execute . . . all laws affecting public lands \\nheretofore or hereafter reserved\" as forest reserves under the 1891 Act. 16 U.S.C. § 472. These acts, ini-\\ntially focused on public lands in the western United \\n14 \\n States, established the foundation of the current na-\\ntional forest system. See 36 C.F.R. § 200.3(b)(2). \\n The 1911 Weeks Act then authorized the Secretary \\nof Agriculture to acquire pri vate lands to establish na-\\ntional forests in the eastern United States. Act of Mar. \\n1, 1911, ch. 186, § 9, 36 Stat. 962, § 6 (codified at 16 U.S.C. § 515).\\n21 Congress also directed that those lands \\nbe \"permanently reserved, held, and administered as \\nnational forest lands under the provisions of \" the 1891 Act as supplemented. 16 U.S.C. § 521; see also id . \\n§ 521a.

      "{\"B. When Congress Transfers Administrative Jurisdiction From The Agriculture Department's Forest Service And The Interior Department's Park Service, It Does So Explicitly\": '. \\n The structure of the Trails  Act consistently reflects \\nCongress\\'s intent that federal agency land manage-\\nment jurisdiction be left undisturbed. The \"Secretary \\ncharged with the administration of a national scenic . . . trail may relocate segments of a national scenic . . . \\ntrail right-of-way,\" but only \" with the concurrence of \\nthe head of the Federal agency having jurisdiction over the lands involved .\" 16 U.S.C. § 1246(b) (emphasis \\nadded). The Secretary \"may issue regulations,\" but \\nonly \" with the concurrence of the heads of any other \\nFederal agencies administering lands through which a \\n. . . national scenic . . . trail passes .\" Id. § 1246(i) (em-\\nphasis added). \\n Congress elsewhere consistently has been explicit \\nwhen it intends to transfe r jurisdiction from one fed-\\neral agency to ano ther. On the same day he signed the \\nTrails Act, President John son signed legislation es-\\ntablishing North Cascades National Park. That con-\\ntemporaneous legislation expressly transferred the \\nadministrative jurisdiction of lands from the national \\nforest system to the National Park System: \\nFederal property within the boundaries of the \\npark and recreation areas is hereby trans-ferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the \\nSecretary [of the Interior] for administration \\nby him as part of the park and recreation \\n19 \\n areas. The national forest land within such \\nboundaries is hereby eliminated from the na-\\ntional forests within which it was heretofore \\nlocated.  \\nAct of Jan. 15, 1968, Pub. L. No. 90-544, 82 Stat. 926 \\n(codified at 16 U.S.C. § 90b(a)) (emphasis added).26 \\n Similarly, when establishing Great Basin National \\nPark some years later, Cong ress specified that \"[l]ands \\nand waters . . . within the boundaries of the park which \\nwere administered by the Forest Service . . . prior to \\n[the date of enactment of this Act] are hereby trans-ferred to the administrative jurisdiction of the Secre-\\ntary [of the Interior].\" 16 U.S.C. § 410mm-2; see also 16 \\nU.S.C. § 192b-9 (boundary adjustments for Rocky Mountain National Park). \\n Two examples from the Appalachian Trail area \\nfurther demonstrate that when Congress puts land \\ninto a national park system unit, it says so. See 16 \\nU.S.C. § 403k-1 (\"Subject to valid existing rights, all lands within the boundaries of Great Smoky Moun-\\ntains National Park . . . hereafter shall be a part of the \\n \\n 26 In President Johnson\\'s remarks on signing the Trails Act, \\nhe stated that \"[o]ur history of wise management of America\\'s na-tional forests has assisted us in designating the initial elements of the National Trails System. . . . : the Appalachian Trail and the \\nPacific Crest Trail.\" Presidential Remarks Upon Signing Four Bills Relating to Conservation and Outdoor Recreation, 2 Pub. Papers 1000, 1001 (Oct. 2, 1968). H ad the Trails Act involved an \\nextensive jurisdictional transfer of national forest system land to the Park Service for the Appalachian Trail, it would have been unusual for the President to invoke the history of America\\'s na-\\ntional forest  management as an impetus for designating the Trail. \\n20 \\n national park and shall be subject to all laws, rules, \\nand regulations applicable to the national park.\"); 16 \\nU.S.C. § 403-3 (\"Subject to valid existing rights, the \\nlands and interests in lands which comprise section 1-A of the Blue Ridge Parkway . . . are excluded from the \\nparkway, made a part of the Shenandoah National \\nPark, and shall be administer ed in accordance with the \\nAct of August 25, 1916 (39 Stat. 535; 16 U.S.C. 1-4).\"). \\n Such jurisdictional transfer language is conspicu-\\nously absent from the Trails Act. Simply put, had Con-\\ngress intended to convert the Trail corridor lands into \\nlands of the National Park System, it would have said so. Any uncertainty over the significance of the absence \\nof transfer language should have been put to rest by \\nthe fact that the Trails Act lacks any of the other or-ganizational provisions that might reasonably be ex-\\npected to accompany a major change in allocation of \\nexecutive branch responsibilities across eight national forests in a fourteen-state region. The Trails Act makes \\nno mention of budget authority, personnel and prop-\\nerty reassignment, transition  schedule or process, re-\\nassignment of permits or easements. Indeed, the Trails \\nAct does not mention the Park Service except for the \\npurpose of maintaining a Trail map. See Whitman v. \\nAm. Trucking Ass\\'n , 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001) (\"Con-\\ngress . . . does not alter the fundamental details of a \\nregulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provi-sions—it does not, one might say, hide elephants in \\nmouseholes.\"). \\n Three other considerations strongly reinforce the \\nconclusion that the circuit court erred in interpreting \\n21 \\n the Trails Act. First , Congress had rejected at least \\neight proposals to transfer the national forests to the \\nInterior Department in the years preceding enactment \\nof the Trails Act, and it is highly unlikely that it would \\nhave transferred national forest lands sub silentio .27 \\nSecond , Congress has given significant consideration \\nto the question whether the relevant portions of the George Washington and Jefferson national forests \\ndeserved enhanced protection  from commercial develop-\\nment and has chosen not to do so, thus strongly indicat-ing that Congress would not have done indirectly by \\nimplication what it has de clined to do directly.\\n28 Third , \\n \\n 27 Ross W.

Congress has designated numerous sections of \\nGeorge Washington and Jefferson national forest  lands crossed \\nby the Appalachian Trail as wilderness under the Wilderness Act \\n \\n22 \\n numerous major interstate gas pipelines crossed the \\nlands used for the Trail at the time Congress approved \\nthe Trails Act.29 The interstate pipelines were then, as \\ntoday, subject to federal approval under the provisions of the Natural Gas Act.

      "{\"II. The Circuit Court's Holding Conflicts With This Court's Decisions On Harmonizing Potentially Conflicting Statutes\": '. \\n The Fourth Circuit was faced with reconciling the \\nTrails Act with the Weeks Act to determine the ap-\\nplicability of the Mineral Leasing Act. The court mis-characterized the Trails Act in a way that presented an \\napparent conflict with the Weeks Act, which in turn vi-\\ntiated the Mineral Leasing Act. The court made no \\n \\nof 1964, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1131-1136. See, e.g., Act of Oct. 30, 1984, \\nPub. L. No. 98-586, 98 Stat. 3105 (designating the Thunder Ridge, Mountain Lake, Peters Mountain, Beartown, Little Wilson Creek, \\nLewis Fork, Priest Wi lderness Areas in Virg inia). Congress has \\nnever found that the national forest lands proposed to be used for the Atlantic or MVP below-grade Trail crossings warrant wilder-ness protection. \\n \\n29 A 1968 map prepared by the Federal Power Commission, \\nFERC\\'s predecessor agency charged with implementation of the Natural Gas Act, shows multiple major gas pipelines in the area \\nof the Trail. That map is included as Attachment A. Attachment B shows the approximate route of the Trail superimposed on the map by amicus  Mountain Valley using contemporary geographic \\ninformation system data for the Trail\\'s current route. \\n23 \\n effort to interpret the Weeks Act in concert with the \\nTrails Act. By failing to even try to reconcile and har-\\nmonize the statutes, the Fourth Circuit transformed \\n\"from expounder[ ] of what the law is into policy-\\nmaker[ ] choosing what the law should be .\" Epic Sys. \\nCorp. v. Lewis , 138 S. Ct. 1612, 1624 (2018). \\n When \"confronted with two Acts of Congress alleg-\\nedly touching on the same topic, this Court is not at \\n\\'liberty to pick and choose among congressional enact-ments\\' and must instead strive \\'to give effect to both.\\' \" \\nId. (quoting Morton v. Mancari , 417 U.S. 535, 551 \\n(1974)). The project challengers below bore a \"heavy burden\"—that was never met or even considered by \\nthe circuit court—to show that Congress implicitly dis-\\nplaced the controlling national forest-administration statutes through the 1968 Trails Act. See id . \\n The circuit court simply presumed  that the entire \\nalmost 2,200-mile long Trail corridor is land in the \\n\"National Park System\" because the Trail was generi-\\ncally referenced in the record as a \" \\'unit\\' of the Na-tional Park System.\" Pet. App. 55a (No. 18-1584). But \\na shorthand labeling reference, useful to agency staff \\nresponding to an internal Interior Department delega-tion of responsibility to implement the Trails Act, does \\nnot itself transfer administration of all lands within \\nthe Trail corridor to the Park Service, change the language of the Trails Act, or even modify the Park \\nService\\'s own longstanding administrative interpreta-\\ntion, application, and understanding of the Trails Act as reflected in the agency\\'s management documents \\nand consistent practice. See FCC v. Fox TV Stations , \\n24 \\n 556 U.S. 502, 513-16 (2009); see also  Pet. at 24-25 (No. \\n18-1587); Pet. at 19-21 (No. 18-1584). \\n The circuit court\\'s approach results in an implau-\\nsible reading of the Trails Act. Extending the Fourth \\nCircuit\\'s reasoning to other national scenic trails, such \\nas the Continental Divide Trail, where the Trails Act assigns to the Secretary of Agriculture the trail-admin-\\nistration role, see 16 U.S.C. § 1244(a)(5), would convert \\nnarrow strips of Yellowstone, Glacier, and Rocky Moun-tain national parks into national forests without any \\ncongressional action. The same would hold true for the \\nfive other national scenic or historic trails adminis-tered by the Forest Service, many of which also trav-\\nerse national park system lands.\\n30 Numerous other \\nnational scenic and historic trails are administered by \\nthe Park Service. The circuit court\\'s decision, if applied \\nand followed nationwide, woul d elevate all those trails, \\n42,127 miles in all, to \"land in the National Park Sys-tem.\"\\n31 \\n--------------------------------- \\uf0a8 ---------------------------------  \\n \\n \\n 30 Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, Florida National Sce-\\nnic Trail, Nez Perce National Historic Trail, Arizona National Scenic Trail, and Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail. 16 U.S.C. § 1244(a)(2), (13), (14), (27), (30). \\n \\n31 National Historic Trails , Nat\\'l Park Serv., https://www.nps. \\ngov/subjects/nationaltrailssystem/n ational-historic-trails.htm (last \\nvisited July 18, 2019).

      "FAMM has a strong interest in advocating for rigor-\n",
      "ous judicial scrutiny. \n",
      "INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY \n",
      "I. The rule of lenity has an important role to  \n",
      "play in the interpretation of mandatory minimum sentencing statutes and shou ld be given special force \n",
      "in cases that involve them.  Mandatory minimum \n",
      "sentencing statutes pose special threats to individual liberty and the separation of powers.  Experience \n",
      "teaches that such statut e s  l e a d  t o  s e v e r e  a n d  \n",
      "disproportionate sentences, reallocate power from \n",
      "legislators and judges to prosecutors, and often \n",
      "ultimately fail to achieve their ostensible goal of \n",
      "sentencing uniformity.  Experience also teaches that \n",
      "such statutes are poorly drafted and difficult to \n",
      "apply.  Because the costs of overreading harsh \n",
      "sentencing statutes are high , lenity counsels in favor \n",
      "of narrower reading. \n",
      " 3 \n",
      "A. The most obvious cost of error in overreading a  \n",
      "mandatory minimum sentencing statute is the lost liberty of individuals who receive a far longer prison term than the legislature actually intended.  Lenity \n",
      "embodies the courts' \"instinctive distaste[] against \n",
      "men languishing in prison unless the lawmaker has \n",
      "clearly said they should.\"  Henry J. Friendly, \"Mr. \n",
      "Justice Frankfurter and the Reading of Statutes,\" in \n",
      "Benchmarks  196, 209 (1967).  A mandatory 15-year \n",
      "sentence based on less-than-certain evidence of \n",
      "legislative intent is indeed distasteful.  Mandatory \n",
      "minimum statutes like the one here also reflect moral condemnation for a special subgroup of criminals – as \n",
      "shown by Congress's decision to pass an \"Armed \n",
      "Career Criminal Act\" (\"ACCA\") – that should follow \n",
      "only from a genuine legislative decision. \n",
      "Mandatory minimum sentencing statutes also \n",
      "impair courts' efforts to achieve the important goals \n",
      "of fairness and proportionate punishment.  Although Congress has the power (within constitutional \n",
      "bounds) to sacrifice fairness and proportionality to a \n",
      "perceived greater good, courts should not conclude \n",
      "that Congress has done so based on guesswork or \n",
      "speculation about the meaning of an unclear statute.  \n",
      "Often, mandatory minimum sentencing statutes fail \n",
      "to achieve the goal of sentencing uniformity because they place great power in the hands of prosecutors, \n",
      "thus inviting inconsistent and arbitrary application.  \n",
      "Applying the rule of lenity rigorously to such statutes \n",
      "lessens those costs to the system and ensures that \n",
      "they are imposed only when Congress has truly \n",
      "found them justified. \n",
      "By contrast, erring on the side of narrow \n",
      "constructions for mandatory minimum statutes is \n",
      "less risky.  Most importantly, judges always retain \n",
      "power to sentence up to the statutory maximum or to \n",
      " 4 \n",
      "run sentences for multiple offenses consecutively.  \n",
      "They do not need mandatory minimums to determine \n",
      "appropriate sentences based on the nature of an \n",
      "offense or the history and characteristics of an \n",
      "offender.  Moreover, the go vernment is well situated \n",
      "to press for new legislation if dissatisfied with the \n",
      "courts' interpretation.  There is no reason to doubt \n",
      "that prosecutors will call for stronger criminal penalties in response to any true threat to public \n",
      "safety or that legislators will fail to answer such calls. \n",
      "B. The risk of error is particularly acute when \n",
      "courts interpret mandatory minimum sentencing statutes.  As this Court knows all too well, Congress \n",
      "often writes such statutes in a confusing way.  The \n",
      "statutory provision here resulted from a rare \n",
      "confession of error by the Solicitor General that, in \n",
      "essence, Congress had left needed language out of a 15-year sentencing statute and so had inflicted a \n",
      "harsher and broader penalty than anyone involved  \n",
      "in the statute's creation (the Justice Department \n",
      "included) had anticipated.  This Court's recent cases \n",
      "have invalidated other parts of § 924 as unconsti-\n",
      "tutionally vague, and over the years the Court has \n",
      "remarked on similar problems with other mandatory minimum sentencing statutes.  When Congress \n",
      "enacts mandatory minimum sentencing statutes  \n",
      "with enormous effects on future defendants, but \n",
      "gives little consideration to statutory details, the rule \n",
      "of lenity provides a much-needed safeguard for \n",
      "individual liberty. \n",
      "II. The rule of lenity confirms that this Court \n",
      "should reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.  \n",
      "Petitioner Wooden correctly argues that 18 U.S.C. \n",
      "§ 924(e) should be read in his favor even without the \n",
      "rule of lenity.  If any doubt remains, lenity should \n",
      "dispose of it.  That conclusion is further supported  \n",
      " 5 \n",
      "by examining judicial experience with cases under \n",
      "§ 924(e)(1).  The standard endorsed by the court of \n",
      "appeals – under which even a moment's separation \n",
      "between two prior offenses qualifies them as \n",
      "occurring on different occasions – has led to \n",
      "inconsistent results, arbitrary distinctions, and \n",
      "repeated judicial observations about confusion and \n",
      "uncertainty in the statutory scheme. \n",
      "A. One recurring type of situation involves \n",
      "burglaries of related or adjacent structures or dwellings.  Examples include the mini-warehouses at \n",
      "issue here; a group of adjacent storage units at the same street address in United States v. Carr , 592 \n",
      "F.3d 636 (4th Cir. 2010); and three businesses in a \n",
      "single strip mall in United States v. Hudspeth , 42 \n",
      "F.3d 1015 (7th Cir. 1994) (en banc), abrogated on \n",
      "other grounds by Shepard v. United States , 544 U.S. \n",
      "13 (2005).  Whether assessed against the constitu-tional right to fair warnin g or the legislature's sole \n",
      "responsibility under the Constitution to define \n",
      "crimes, the statute does no t clearly classify several \n",
      "break-ins in the course of a day or an hour as prior \n",
      "offenses on \"occasions different from one another.\"  \n",
      "Accordingly, the statute should not be construed to \n",
      "mandate 15 years in prison by treating such offenses \n",

While debating the extent to \\nwhich the Constitution should enshrine protections for religious freedom during the First Congress, \\nRepresentative Daniel Carroll of Maryland\\u2014one of \\nthe few Catholics among the Constitution\\u2019s \\nFramers\\u2014remarked \\u201cthe rights of conscience are, in \\ntheir nature, of peculiar delicacy, and will little bear \\nthe gentlest touch of governmental hand.\\u201d 1 Annals \\nof Cong. 757-58 (Joseph Gales ed., 1834) (Aug. 15, 1789). \\nNowhere are the rights of the religious more \\ndelicate than when they intersect with the freedom \\nto put faith into action, belief into words. If the \\nrobust religious freedom protections guaranteed by \\nour Constitution are to have any meaning, they must \\nbe capable of shielding a sincere religious believer from being coerced into speaking against the core \\ntenants of her faith. To hold otherwise would be to \\npermit the heavy hand of government to extinguish \\nreligious practice. This the Constitution will not \\nallow. \\nThe Founders understood that the First \\nAmendment, as drafted, protected all religious sects in their right to speak freely in accordance with their \\nfaith. Indeed, the Founding Generation believed \\nprotections for religious lib erty to be of utmost \\nimport. Since its founding, America has been gripped \\n 3 \\nin debate over religious liberty. Even before the \\ncolonies declared their independence, there were \\nenergetic discussions over the bounds of religious \\ntoleration versus a full freedom to exercise religion \\n(with only limited exceptions). Ultimately, the \\nConstitution\\u2019s drafters settled on James Madison\\u2019s \\nview of an unalienable right to practice one\\u2019s \\nreligious faith. Owed to an understanding that the Governor of the Universe supersedes any earthly \\nauthority, religious convictions were understood to \\ncommand greater deference than mere personal \\nopinions. Where opinion was required to yield to the \\nlaw, tensions between law and religious belief often \\nresulted in exemption for the believer. \\nThe Founding Generation also viewed religious \\nliberty as encompassing more  than mere matters of \\nconscience or decisions on the rightness or wrongness \\nof acts. Instead, the full ex ercise of religion offered a \\nright to act in accordance with one\\u2019s faith and, \\nnecessarily, included protection from government \\ncompelled speech that violated a believer\\u2019s firmly \\nheld religious convictions. This distinction was \\nperhaps most clearly expressed in the early colonies\\u2019 \\nanti-Catholic prejudices. In colonial Georgia, for example, while all worshipers were vested by its \\nCharter with a liberty of conscience, Catholics were \\nexpressly excluded from protections for the more \\nrobust free exercise of religion. McConnell, The \\nOrigins and Historical Understanding of Free \\nExercise of Religion, 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1409, 1489-90 \\n(1989) (hereinafter McConnell, Origins). \\nInformed by the debates and experiences of their \\ntime, the Founders opted to include among the Constitution\\u2019s protections the more extensive free \\n 4 \\nexercise of religion. In so doing, they extended the \\nmaximum protections available to all who professed \\nbelief in a Universal Sovereign. These protections, it \\nwas understood, included a right to act out belief and \\nto speak, or refrain from speaking, freely, in \\naccordance with faith. \\nWith this understanding as background, it is \\nclear the First Amendment provides dual protections for religious expression (or non-expression) in its \\nguarantees of free speech and free religious exercise. \\nThis reality compels the conclusion that religious \\nspeech enjoys the highest constitutional protection. \\nCertainly, this is consistent with the Founders\\u2019 \\nunderstanding of robust religious liberty protections, \\nas revealed in the text, history, and tradition of the First Amendment. \\nThis Court\\u2019s recent religious liberty jurisprudence \\nconcurs with the Founders\\u2019 view of full-throated \\nreligious liberty protection. Religious observers have \\nwelcomed the relief from government oppression. No \\nlonger can religious believers be excluded solely \\nbecause of their religious identity. Free are the religious to express their religious views without fear \\nof government reprisal. This Court\\u2019s precedents have \\nbeen unequivocal: if government can achieve its \\nmeans without burdening religion, the Constitution \\nalmost always requires that it must. \\nAnother truism is derived from this Court\\u2019s \\nprecedents. When religious liberty concerns are coupled with free expression, the Constitution \\ndemands the most exacting scrutiny. That is because \\nthe First Amendment, as understood from the \\nFounding, provides special protection for the \\n 5 \\nreligious, their right to speak freely, and their right \\nto refrain from speaking. Distinct from pure \\ncommercial speech, religious speech demands a \\nhigher constitutional protection. That is why, to \\nAmicus Curiae\\u2019s knowledge, government compelled \\nreligious speech has never been held to survive strict \\nscrutiny. \\nAgainst this backdrop, the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s opinion \\ncannot stand. Although purporting to apply strict scrutiny, the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s analysis is rife with \\nflaws, each one fatal to the court\\u2019s conclusion. From \\nthe outset, the Tenth Circuit failed to recognize the \\npreferred status of Ms. Smith\\u2019s free speech rights, \\ngrounded as they are in her religious beliefs. This \\nfailure is only compounded by the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s lethargic narrow-tailoring analysis. Far from the \\nexacting analysis this Court requires, the Tenth \\nCircuit settles into a now familiar pattern to those of \\nfaith\\u2014ostracizing Ms. Smith from society because of \\nher religious identity. \\nOnce again, this Court must reverse yet another \\nassault on religious freedom by declaring that where, as here, free speech and religion intersect, \\nconstitutional protections are at their greatest. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 6 \\nARGUMENT \\nI. AS ORIGINALLY UNDERSTOOD , THE FIRST \\nAMENDMENT PROTECTED THE RIGHT OF THE \\nRELIGIOUS TO SPEAK AND TO REMAIN SILENT . \\nThe First Amendment is \\u201cunique in form among \\namendments to the Constitution.\\u201d2 It is drafted, not \\nas a grant of privileges or rights to the people, but as \\na disability on Congress\\u2019 ability to act. Report to the Attorney General, supra  note 2, at 15\\u201316. In its \\nentirety, the First Amendment reads: \\nCongress shall make no law respecting \\nan establishment of religion, or \\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; or \\nabridging the freedom of speech, or of \\nthe press; or the right of the people \\npeaceably to assemble, and to petition \\nthe Government for a redress of grievances.  \\nU.S.\\n Const., Amdt. 1. \\nIn barring certain kinds of laws, the First \\nAmendment recognizes a pre-existing \\u201cimmun[ity] from such legislative action.\\u201d Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral, supra note 2, at 16. This reflects an \\nunderstanding by the Founding Generation that these \\u201care pre-existent rights\\u2014inalienable rights\\u2014\\n                                           \\n2 O f f i c e  o f  L e g a l  P o l i c y ,  D e p t  o f  J u s t i c e ,  R e p o r t  t o  t h e  \\nAttorney General: Religious Li berty Under the Free Exercise \\nClause at 15 (1986) (hereinafter Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral). \\n 7 \\nand not mere civil privileges conferred by a \\nbenevolent sovereign.\\u201d Id. \\nTaken together, the text, history, and philosophy \\nof the First Amendment establish the principle that \\n\\u201cthe government has no right to interfere with the \\nfree exercise of religion\\u201d unless the \\u201cgovernment \\naction is necessary to prevent manifest danger to the \\nexistence of the state; to protect public peace, safety, \\nand order; or to secure the religious liberty of \\nothers.\\u201d Id., at v. And, even then, only if the \\ngovernment deploys \\u201cthe least restrictive means \\nnecessary to protect these interests.\\u201d Id. This is true \\nas a matter of the First Amendment\\u2019s Religious Liberty Clauses. And because freedom of religion \\ncannot be divorced from freedom of expression, it is \\neven more true when the government tries to force a \\nbeliever to speak in a way that cannot be reconciled \\nwith her religious convictions. \\nA. Religious liberty was profoundly \\nimportant to the Founding Generation; \\nreligious convictions were understood \\nto receive greater deference than mere \\npersonal opinion. \\n1. The Founding Generation was uniquely \\nattuned to issues regarding the proper relationship \\nbetween religion and government. Indeed, at the time of America\\u2019s founding there was \\u201can intense and \\ncontroversial theoretical debate\\u201d of these issues \\ninvolving \\u201c[m]ost of the great political thinkers of the \\nperiod.\\u201d McConnell, Origins, at 1430. These thinkers \\ninformed the Founders\\u2019 own debates on the issue and \\nundoubtedly \\u201cinfluenced the American solution to \\nthe problem.\\u201d Id.  \\n 8 \\nJohn Locke, perhaps more than any other \\nphilosopher who contributed to the ideas \\nunderpinning America\\u2019s founding, provided the \\n\\u201cmost extensive\\u201d discussion of religion and most \\ndirectly influenced the Framers\\u2019 drafting of the First \\nAmendment. Id. Locke was an early and influential \\ntheoretical thinker and advocate for religious freedom. Id., at 1431. In his view \\u201creligious rivalry \\nand intolerance\\u201d were \\u201camong the most important of political problems,\\u201d and \\u201c[r]eligious intolerance was inconsistent both with public peace and with good \\ngovernment.\\u201d Id. \\nLocke\\u2019s solution, however, was an \\u201cunderstanding \\nof religious toleration,\\u201d that \\u201cexpressly precludes free \\nexercise exemptions.\\u201d Id., at 1435. To Locke, when \\n\\u201cindividual conscience conflicts with the governmental policy, the government will always \\nprevail and the individual will always be forced to \\nsubmit or suffer the punishment.\\u201d Id. Locke\\u2019s \\ninfluence on the drafters of the First Amendment makes it all the more remarkable that his view did \\nnot triumph with America\\u2019s founding. \\nThe American Revolution upended the \\npreexisting relationship between religion and government, especially in states where the Anglican \\nChurch had the most influence. Id., at 1436. \\n\\u201cAmerica was in the wake of a great religious \\nrevival,\\u201d that brought with it a \\u201cdrive for religious \\nfreedom.\\u201d Id., at 1437\\u201338. Along with this drive came \\na push from \\u201creligious supporters of disestablishment and free exercise\\u201d to enshrine \\n\\u201cconstitutional protections\\u201d for religious freedoms \\u201cat the federal level.\\u201d Id., at 1440. \\n 9 \\nThis movement was encapsulated in debate \\nsurrounding the religious liberty clause in Virginia\\u2019s \\n1776 Bill of Rights. When George Mason proposed \\nusing the Lockean phrase \\u201ctoleration of religion,\\u201d \\nJames Madison objected, complaining that the \\nphrase implied an act of legislative grace (which, to \\nLocke, it did). Id. , at 1443. Madison was not alone \\namong the Founding Generation in rejecting this concept. George Washin gton and Thomas Paine \\nsimilarly eschewed \\u201ctoleration,\\u201d decrying its \\nimplication of government \\u201cindulgence\\u201d rather than a \\nfundamental, preexisting right. Id., at 1443\\u201344. \\nMoreover, Madison objected to Mason\\u2019s proposal \\nbecause it excepted from even the \\u201ctoleration\\u201d of \\nreligious freedom any instance where \\u201cunder color of \\nreligion any man disturb the peace, the happiness, or \\nsafety of society.\\u201d See G. Hunt, James Madison and \\nReligious Liberty, 1 Ann. Rep. Am. Hist. A. 163, 166 \\n(1901). It was Madison\\u2019s belief that such phrasing \\n\\u201cmight easily be so twisted as to oppress religious \\nsects under the excuse that they disturbed \\u2018the \\npeace, the happiness, or safety of society.\\u2019\\u201d Id. \\nMadison\\u2019s objections were heard by Virginia\\u2019s \\nassembly. As adopted, Virginia\\u2019s Bill of Rights \\npromised that all \\u201care equally entitled to the free \\nexercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience,\\u201d and reminded only \\u201cthat\\n it is the mutual \\nduty of all to practice Christian forbearance, love, and charity towards each other.\\u201d Report to the \\nAttorney General, supra  note 2, at 102\\u201303. \\n2. This early debate between Madison and Mason \\nbears witness to what this Court has long noted\\u2014\\nthat Madison was \\u201cthe leading architect of the \\n 10\\nreligion clauses of the First Amendment.\\u201d Hosanna-\\nTabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v. \\nEEOC , 565 U.S. 171, 184 (2012) (internal quotation \\nmarks omitted). Madison\\u2019s rejection of religious \\ntolerance in favor of full and free religious expression permeates his Memorial and Remonstrance . \\nExplaining that \\u201c[t]he Religion then of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every \\nman,\\u201d Madison understood that it is not just \\u201cthe \\nright of every man to exercise it as these may \\ndictate,\\u201d but further \\u201cthe duty of every man to render \\nto the Creator such homage, and such only, as he \\nbelieves to be acceptable to him.\\u201d J. Madison, \\nMemorial and Remonstrance \\u00a7 1 (1785), reprinted in \\nEverson v. Bd. of Educ. , 330 U.S. 1, 64 (1947). This \\nright, Madison admonished, \\u201cis in its nature an unalienable right.\\u201d Id. \\nMadison expounded his view that \\u201c[t]his duty is \\nprecedent both in order of time and degree of \\nobligation, to the claims of Civil Society.\\u201d Id. Before \\nanyone is \\u201ca member of Civil Society,\\u201d they are \\u201cconsidered as a subject of the Governor of the \\nUniverse.\\u201d Id. For this reason, \\u201cin matters of \\nReligion, no man\\u2019s right is abridged by the institution of Civil Society.\\u201d Id. But Madison went \\nfurther. \\u201c[I]f religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that \\nof the Legislative Body.\\u201d Id., at \\u00a7 2, reprinted in \\nEverson , 330 U.S., at 65. Legislators who \\n\\u201cencroach[]\\u201d on the rights of the people, Madison \\nsaid, \\u201cexceed the commission from which they derive their authority, and are Tyrants.\\u201d Id. \\nRecognizing that Madison\\u2019s Memorial and \\nRemonstrance is not law, see City of Boerne v. Flores , \\n 11\\n521 U.S. 507, 541 (1997) (Scalia, J., concurring), it \\nnonetheless offers a clear understanding of why the \\nFounding Generation thought it so crucial to \\nmemorialize the inalienable freedom of religion in \\nthe First Amendment. And Madison\\u2019s defense of the \\nAmerican conception of religious liberty merely \\nechoed the prevalent thought at the founding \\u201cof the \\ndifference between religious faith and other forms of human judgment.\\u201d McConnell, Origins, at 1496. \\nAt the Founding, the prevailing view was that the \\n\\u201copinions of individuals\\u201d can not take \\u201cprecedence \\nover the decisions of civil society.\\u201d Id. The same was \\nnot true for religious convictions. \\u201cConflicts arising from religious convictions were conceived not as a \\nclash between the judgment of the individual and of \\nthe state, but as a conflict between earthly and \\nspiritual sovereigns.\\u201d Id. In those instances, the \\nperson holding the religious conviction \\u201cwas not seen as the instigator of the conflict; the believer was simply caught between the inconsistent demands of \\ntwo rightful authorities, through no fault of his own.\\u201d \\nId. This view is essential to understanding the \\nFounders\\u2019 belief that \\u201cfreedom of religion is unalienable because it is a duty to God and not a \\nprivilege of the individual.\\u201d Id., at 1497. \\n3. Bolstering this understanding, the historical \\nrecord surrounding adoption of the Bill of Rights \\nsuggests that the First Amendment\\u2019s use of the term \\u201creligion\\u201d was a deliberate choice. See McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1488. Although \\u201c[t]he recorded debates \\nin\\u201d both chambers of Congress \\u201ccast little light on the \\nmeaning of the free exercise clause,\\u201d looking at \\nsuccessive drafts of the clause from its consideration \\nand debate in the First Congress are especially \\n 12\\nenlightening. Id., at 1481, 1483. While earlier drafts \\nof the First Amendment used the phrase \\u201crights of \\nconscience,\\u201d the final version that emerged enshrined in the First Amendment a protection for the \\u201cfree \\nexercise of religion.\\u201d Id., at 1488. This phrasing lends \\nfurther support to the Founders\\u2019 understanding of religious freedoms. \\nTo the Founders, \\u201c[b]elief in a Supreme Being \\nwas\\u201d essential to \\u201creligion.\\u201d Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral, supra  note 2, at 9. Indeed, \\u201c[t]he historical \\nmaterials uniformly equate \\u2018religion\\u2019 with belief in God or in gods.\\u201d McConnell, Origins, at 1493. These references \\u201ccan be extended without distortion to \\ntranscendent extrapersonal authorities not \\nenvisioned in traditionally theistic terms\\u201d\\u2014for \\nexample, Madison\\u2019s use of \\u201cCreator,\\u201d \\u201cGovernor of \\nthe Universe,\\u201d and \\u201cUniversal Sovereign,\\u201d imply \\u201can attempt at a definition more compendious than the \\nfamiliar Judeo-Christian God, but it retains the distinction between transcendent authority and \\npersonal judgment.\\u201d Id.  \\nReligion, as understood by the Founders and \\nexpressed in the First Amendment, then, is best \\ndefined to encompass \\u201ca system of beliefs, whether \\npersonally or institutionally held, prompted by the \\nacceptance of transcendent realities or \\nacknowledging extratemporal actions.\\u201d Report to the \\nAttorney General, supra note 2, at 26\\u201327. This \\ninterpretation of religion is both accurate to the Founders\\u2019 understanding and consistent with their view that religion encompasses \\u201cduties that were \\nbeyond the jurisdiction of the state either to \\nprescribe or to proscribe.\\u201d Id., at 9. To the Founders, \\nreligion encompassed a subservience to a \\n 13\\n\\u201ctranscendent reality,\\u201d which if abandoned could \\nunleash \\u201cextratemporal consequences.\\u201d Id., at 29. \\nThis explains their motivation to preserve a robust freedom from government \\u201cinterfere[nce] with such \\nbeliefs or duties.\\u201d Id. \\nB. The Founding Generation\\u2019s understanding of religious liberty \\nencompassed protection for believers \\nfrom compelled speech that violates \\nfirmly held religious beliefs. \\n1. The least controversial point about the phrase \\n\\u201cfree exercise\\u201d is that \\u201cby definition, the words denote action or activity.\\u201d Id., at 19. To the Founders, \\nreligious liberty undoubtedly included \\u201creligiously motivated conduct  as well as belief.\\u201d McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1488 (emphasis added). This point bears emphasis because of this Court\\u2019s history rejecting \\nsuch a reading. See  Reynolds v. United States , 98 \\nU.S. 145, 164 (1878); but see Fulton v. City of Phila. , \\n141 S. Ct. 1868, 1913 (2021) (Alito, J., concurring) \\n(noting \\u201c[t]he Court ha[s] repudiated that distinction\\u201d in Reynolds  \\u201cthat the Free Exercise \\nClause protects beliefs, not conduct\\u201d). \\nIn substituting the \\u201crights of conscience\\u201d in favor \\nof a protection for the \\u201cfree exercise of religion,\\u201d the \\nFramer\\u2019s chose a phrase that \\u201cstrongly connoted \\naction,\\u201d in place of one that suggested mere opinion \\nor belief. McConnell, Origins, at 1489. Leading \\ndictionaries of that era defined \\u201cexercise\\u201d to include \\n\\u201c[l]abour of the body,\\u201d \\u201c[t]ask; that which one is \\nappointed to perform,\\u201d \\u201c[a]ct of divine worship, \\nwhether public or private,\\u201d or \\u201c[t]o use or practice.\\u201d See id.  (collecting dictionary definitions). Conscience, \\n 14\\non the other hand, was more likely to imply a \\n\\u201cnatural knowledge, or the faculty that decides on \\nthe right or wrong of actions.\\u201d Id. (quoting N. \\nWebster, A Dictionary of The English Language 301 (New Haven 1807)). \\nParticularly instructive on this distinction is the \\nGeorgia Charter of 1732. The Charter included \\u201ca \\nliberty of conscience allowe d in the worship of God, \\nto all persons,\\u201d but reserved the more exclusive right to \\u201ca free exercise of religion,\\u201d only to \\u201call such persons, except papists.\\u201d Id., at 1489\\u201390. By granting \\nCatholics only a liberty of conscience, but not the free exercise of religion, the Georgia Charter necessarily \\nreserved a fuller right to non-Catholic worshipers. \\nOne scholar has observed that \\u201c[t]he most plausible \\nreading of the provision is that it permitted Catholics \\nto believe what they wished . . . but did not permit \\nthem to put their faith into action.\\u201d Id., at 1490. \\nBy including a full and robust \\u201cfree exercise of \\nreligion\\u201d within the First Amendment, the Founders understood that they were protecting not only the \\nright for the religious to believe what their faith \\ntaught, but to put those beliefs into action. To \\nconclude otherwise would be to \\u201ctrivialize the idea of \\nreligion by separating thought from life, faith from \\nworks.\\u201d Report to the Attorney General, supra note \\n2, at 31. Possessing \\u201ca right to believe something in one\\u2019s mind without the freedom to utter it, advocate it, or even translate it into life,\\u201d is hardly a \\nsubstantive freedom at all. Id., at 31\\u201332. \\n2. Consistent with the Founders\\u2019 understanding \\nof a robust religious liberty protection that included \\nthe right to act out your faith was the axiom that \\n 15\\naction naturally includes expression or the freedom \\nto refrain from expression that conflicts with belief. \\nAlthough early religious liberty controversies were \\nrelatively limited, the historical record includes \\nexamples of protections for religious exercise \\nintertwined with such expressive activity. \\nAn early source of common conflict, for example, \\narose around the issue of oath requirements. Oaths \\nserved as \\u201cthe principal means of ensuring honest \\ntestimony and solemnizing obligations.\\u201d McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1467. But many early religious sects \\nrefused to take an oath, believing it was in conflict \\nwith the teachings of the New Testament.3 Id. \\nBecause oaths were required before court testimony, this refusal often left these sincere religious objectors \\nwithout access to the court system. Id. \\nIn response, many of the early colonies adopted \\nalternatives, allowing relig ious dissenters to take a \\npledge or make an affirmation rather than to swear \\nan oath. Id., at 1467\\u201368 (\\u201cBy 1789, virtually all of the \\nstates had enacted oath exemptions.\\u201d). This simple solution permitted religious sects access to the court \\nsystem, without requiring them to act out of step \\n                                           \\n3 See Matthew 5:33-37 (\\u201cAgain, ye have heard that it hath \\nbeen said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, \\nbut shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: But I say unto you, \\nSwear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: Nor \\nby the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is \\nthe city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy \\nhead, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever \\nis more than these cometh of evil.\\u201d). \\n 16\\nwith their religious beliefs or to make an expression \\nthey found incompatible with their faith. \\nA still more extreme example of laws yielding to \\nexpressive activities of religious sects in the \\nFounding Generation can be found in colonial \\nGeorgia. There, the Trus tees of Georgia granted \\ncertain groups of religious refugees a general exemption from the laws that allowed them \\u201cto organize themselves in accordance with their own \\nfaith.\\u201d Id., at 1471. One historia n described one such \\ngroup from Salzburg\\u2014which formed the town of Ebenezer\\u2014as \\u201ca state within a state, a sort of \\ntheocracy under the direction of their minsters with \\ndaily conferences of the entire congregation in which \\nGod\\u2019s guidance was invoked at the beginning and the \\nend.\\u201d Id. Although these groups where required to \\nobey certain colonial laws pertaining to military service, property, and good governance, they were \\n\\u201cotherwise free to govern themselves.\\u201d Id. at 1471 \\nn.312 \\nAnother founding era example of religious \\nexemptions for expressive action appeared in North \\nCarolina and Maryland. There, laws exempted \\nmembers of certain religious sects from a \\nrequirement to remove their hat in court. Id. The \\nreligious objectors viewed such an action as \\u201ca form of obeisance to secular authority forbidden by their \\nreligion.\\u201d Id., at 1472. Rather than forcing members \\nof these sects to choose be tween access to the courts \\nor expressing themselves in violation of their religious beliefs, states offered an exemption. \\nWhile this example may seem trivial by today\\u2019s \\nstandards, it was very mu ch on the minds of the \\n 17\\nFounding Generation. At the time, \\u201c[o]ne of the most \\nnotorious courtroom cases of religious intolerance in \\nEngland involved William Penn\\u2019s refusal to remove \\nhis hat when he appeared in court\\u201d to face \\nindictment for speaking to  an unlawful assembly. Id. \\nWhen Penn refused to remove a court-furnished hat from his head in respect to the court, he was held in \\ncontempt and imprisoned. Id. This case attracted \\nsignificant attention in America, and undoubtedly influenced the exemptions passed in North Carolina and Maryland. Id. \\nIndeed, the importance of this exemption was \\ndemonstrated in debates over the Bill of Rights in \\nthe First Congress. Id., at 1472, n.320. In ridiculing \\nthe list of freedoms proposed to be protected, Theodore Sedgwick of Mass achusetts remarked \\u201cthey \\nmight have declared that a man should have a right to wear his hat if he pleased . . . but he would ask the \\ngentleman whether he thought it necessary to enter \\nthese trifles in a declaration of rights.\\u201d Id. (citation \\nomitted). With unmistakable reference to the Penn case, John Page of Virginia replied: \\nThe gentleman from \\nMassachusetts . . . objects to the clause, \\nbecause the right is of so trivial a \\nnature. He supposes it no more \\nessential than whether a man has a \\nright to wear his hat or not; but let me \\nobserve to him that such rights have \\nbeen opposed, and a man has been obliged to pull off his hat when he \\nappeared before the face of authority; \\npeople have also been prevented from \\n 18\\nassembling together on their lawful \\noccasions.  \\nId. (citation omitted). Certainly, the Founders were \\nacutely aware of the potential for abuse by \\nauthorities absent a robust religious liberty \\nprotection that clearly extended to actions, including \\nreligiously motivated expression or non-expression. \\n3. Taken together, the Free Exercise Clause and \\nthe Free Speech Clause elevate the freedom not to \\nspeak out of accordance with firmly held religious beliefs to the highest echelon of First Amendment \\nprotection. This conclusion is buttressed by the First \\nAmendment\\u2019s other guarantees\\u2014e.g., freedom of \\nassembly and freedom to petition the government. If \\nthe Free Exercise Clause conferred nothing more \\nthan a \\u201cright to express religious beliefs,\\u201d it would \\n\\u201cadd nothing to the First Amendment, since that right is fully protected by the right to assemble, \\nspeak, and publish.\\u201d Report to the Attorney General, \\nsupra note 2, at 19. Indeed, \\u201cbecause religious \\nexpression is doubly protected by the constitutional \\ntext\\u201d it would make little sense if it were \\u201cless \\nprotected in practice.\\u201d Id. , at 19, n.30. \\nThe examples cited above represent a clear \\nunderstanding by the Founding Generation that civil \\nlaws, even of general applicability, must yield when they conflict with religious expression or the freedom \\nto refrain from expression on the basis of a sincerely \\nheld religious belief. As it seems early legislative \\nbodies believed exemptions in such cases were \\nrequired by the principle of free exercise, it stands to \\nreason that the Framers understood \\u201csimilar \\napplications of the principle\\u201d would guide the courts \\n 19\\nin these cases, once \\u201centrusted with the \\nresponsibility of enforcing\\u201d First Amendment \\nguarantees. McConnell, Origins, at 1473. \\nAlthough there was a dearth of litigation over \\nreligious liberty protections in the early years of the \\nRepublic, what scarce examples exist support this \\nview. Consider, for example, the earliest state court \\nopinion addressing the issue of a religious liberty exemption, People v. Phillips . In that case, the court \\nheld that the New York Constitution protected a Catholic priest from compulsory testimony to \\nmatters learned while administering the Sacrament \\nof Confession. See  id., at 1504. \\nImportant to the Phillips court was the notion \\nthat requiring testimony from the priest to \\u201cwhat he \\nreceives in confession, is to declare that there shall \\nbe no penance; and this important branch of the Roman Catholic religion would be thus annihilated.\\u201d \\nId. (citation omitted). The court did not believe it was \\ncompatible with religious liberty to compel expression that would so eviscerate a core belief of Catholic faith. Rather than establishing a special \\nprivilege for adherents to the Catholic faith, though, \\nthe court viewed its actions as necessary to ensure \\nCatholics received the same  treatment as Protestants \\n(the dominant faith at the time) in the administration of their sacraments. Id., at 1504-05. \\nThe through line to the Founding Generation\\u2019s \\nunderstanding of religious liberty was a belief that \\nsuch freedom was without substantive meaning if it did not encompass expression, and non-expression, \\nrooted in religious belief. Noted Nineteenth Century \\n 20\\nConstitutional commentator, Michigan Supreme \\nCourt Justice Thomas Cooley, explained: \\nAn earnest believer usually regards it as his duty to propagate his opinions, \\nand to bring others to his views. To \\ndeprive him of this right is to take from \\nhim the power to perform what he \\nconsiders a most sacred obligation.  \\nT. Cooley, A Treatise on the Constitutional \\nLimitations 665 (7th ed. 1903). Put another way: \\nreligious freedom, as understood by the Founders, \\nnecessarily encompasses the freedom to put belief \\ninto action, to engage in expression consistent with \\nthe dogmas of your faith, and to refrain from \\nexpression that may engender extratemporal consequences. \\nII. T\\nHIS COURT \\u2019S PRECEDENTS \\u2014ESPECIALLY ITS \\nDEMANDING APPLICATION OF THE LEAST -\\nRESTRICTIVE MEANS TEST \\u2014DEMONSTRATE \\nAGREEMENT WITH THE FOUNDING GENERATION \\u2019S \\nROBUST RELIGIOUS LIBERTY PROTECTIONS . \\nThis Court has a commendable history of \\nrecognizing the principles discussed above. In \\nparticular, the Court\\u2019s recent religious liberty \\njurisprudence has been a welcome reprieve for \\nmembers of all faith communities who have been disheartened by the antagonism of some government \\nactors. See,  e.g., Espinoza v. Mont. Dept of Revenue , \\n140 S. Ct. 2246 (2020); Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. \\nColo. Civil Rights Comm\\u2019n , 138 S. Ct. 1719 (2018); \\nHosanna-Tabor , 565 U.S. 171. \\n 21\\nOf particular note is the Court\\u2019s insistence on a \\nforceful application of the strict scrutiny test to any \\nrestriction that burdens religious liberty. Indeed, \\u201cin \\nthis highly sensitive constitutional area, \\u2018only the \\ngravest abuses, endangering paramount interests, \\ngive occasion for permissible limitation.\\u2019\\u201d Sherbert v. \\nVerner , 374 U.S. 398, 406 (1963) (quoting Thomas v. \\nCollins, 323 U.S. 516, 530 (1945)). \\n1. A few examples illustrate the point. Consider \\nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. , where this \\nCourt considered a government-imposed contraceptive mandate on private employers who \\nbelieved such a requirement to be against their \\nreligious beliefs. 573 U.S. 682, 726 (2014).\\n4 While \\nassuming, without deciding, that the government\\u2019s \\ninterest was compelling, the Court nonetheless found \\nthat the least-restrictive-means standard was not \\nmet. Id., at 728. Identifying alternative solutions to \\nthe rigid mandate imposed by the government, the Court explained, \\u201c[t]he least-restrictive-means \\nstandard is exceptionally demanding.\\u201d Id.  As Justice \\nKennedy explained, religious freedom \\u201cimplicates more than just freedom of belief\\u201d; rather \\u201c[i]t means, too, the right to express those beliefs and to establish \\none\\u2019s religious (or nonreligious) self-definition in the \\npolitical, civic, and econ omic life of our larger \\n                                           \\n4 Hobby Lobby  was decided under the Religious Freedom \\nRestoration Act of 1993 (\\u201cRFRA\\u201d), which requires as an initial \\nmatter finding a substantial government burden on the exercise of religion; if such a burden exists, the Court must determine \\nwhether there is a compelling governmental interest and that \\nthe burden is the least restrictive means of furthering that \\ninterest. Hobby Lobby , 573 U.S., at 694-95. \\n 22\\ncommunity.\\u201d Id., at 736\\u201337 (Kennedy, J., \\nconcurring). \\nIn another instance, this Court found Missouri \\nviolated a church\\u2019s religious  liberty guarantees under \\nthe First Amendment when it categorically denied \\ntheir participation in a grant program for playground \\nsurface materials. Trinity Lutheran Church of \\nColumbia, Inc. v. Comer , 137 S. Ct. 2012, 2017, 2025 \\n(2017). Finding that otherwise eligible grant \\nrecipients were disqualified solely because of their \\nreligious nature, this Court held that such a penalty \\nworked against the free exercise of religion and \\u201ctriggers the most exacting scrutiny.\\u201d Id., at 2021. \\nImportantly, the harm was not the denial of the grant itself but instead was Missouri\\u2019s refusal to \\neven allow the church to compete with secular \\norganizations for grant funds solely on the basis of \\nits religious identity. Id., at 2022. \\nMore recently still, this Court took up the mantle \\nof religious liberties in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia . \\nDespite the Catholic Church\\u2019s over two centuries of dedication to serving the needy children of \\nPhiladelphia, the City in 2018 stopped referring foster children to the Catholic Social Services (\\u201cCSS\\u201d) \\nafter learning the organization would not \\u201cconsider \\nprospective foster parents in same-sex marriages.\\u201d \\nFulton , 141 S. Ct., at 1874\\u201375. Finding that \\u201cit is \\nplain\\u201d the City burdens CSS\\u2019s \\u201creligious exercise by putting it to the choice of  curtailing its mission or \\napproving relationships inconsistent with its beliefs,\\u201d this Court sought a review of whether such burden \\nwas \\u201cconstitutionally permissible.\\u201d Id., at 1876. In \\ndetermining that Philadelphia imposed an unconstitutional burden on CSS\\u2019s religious exercise, \\n 23\\nFulton  admonishes that \\u201cso lo ng as the government \\ncan achieve its interests in a manner that does not \\nburden religion, it must do so.\\u201d Id., at 1881. \\nTaken together, the precedents of this Court \\nestablish that an exacting analysis is required in \\nreligious liberty cases to determine whether the \\ngovernment\\u2019s interest is compelling, and its burden \\nnarrowly tailored to achieve that interest. The \\nexistence of an alternative means for achieving even \\na compelling interest is nearly always fatal to the government\\u2019s argument.  \\n2. When religious liberty and free expression \\nconcerns intertwine, this Court has been even less \\nhesitant to invalidate an infringing law. This \\nskepticism is warranted, as attempts to compel \\nexpression that conflicts with an individual\\u2019s \\nreligious beliefs are nothing more than indirect \\nattempts to regulate religion itself. \\nIn 1943, this Court took issue with a West \\nVirginia law mandating a flag salute and pledge, when its application was challenged by a group of \\nJehovah\\u2019s Witnesses who said such action violated \\ntheir religious beliefs. W. Va. State Bd. Of Educ. V. \\nBarnette , 319 U.S. 624 (1943). Refusing to find that \\n\\u201ca Bill of Rights which guards the individual\\u2019s right \\nto speak his own mind, left it open to public \\nauthorities to compel him to utter what is not on his \\nmind,\\u201d the Barnette  Court blocked the law\\u2019s \\nenforcement. Id. , at 634; see also  id., at 645 (Murphy, \\nJ., concurring) (recognizing \\u201c[t]he right of freedom of thought and of religion as guaranteed by the \\nConstitution against State action includes both the \\nright to speak freely and the right to refrain from \\n 24\\nspeaking at all\\u201d). Underlying the Court\\u2019s opinion was \\nthe belief that \\u201c[i]f there is any fixed star in our \\nconstitutional constellation, it is that no official, high \\nor petty, can prescribe what  shall be orthodox in \\npolitics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act \\ntheir faith therein.\\u201d Id., at 642. \\nExpanding on the holding in Barnette , the Court \\nin Wooley v. Maynard  considered a religious \\nobjection to display of the New Hampshire state motto\\u2014\\u201cLive Free or Die\\u201d\\u2014on the license plate of a \\ncar owned by Jehovah\\u2019s Witness. 430 U.S. 705 (1977). In Wooley , the Court expressly rejected the \\nidea that \\u201cthe State may constitutionally require an individual to participate in the dissemination of an \\nideological message by displaying it on his private \\nproperty.\\u201d Id., at 713. \\nFoundational to its decision was the Court\\u2019s \\nholding that the freedoms contained within the First \\nAmendment \\u201cincludes both the right to speak freely \\nand the right to refrain from speaking at all.\\u201d Id., at \\n714. It matters not whether most agree with the message the State seeks to force a person to convey; the First Amendment unquestionably \\u201cprotects the \\nright of individuals to hold a point of view different \\nfrom the majority and to refu se to foster . . . an idea \\nthey find morally objectionable.\\u201d Id. , at 715. Finding \\nthe existence of a governmental burden, the Court \\nwas left to question whether a substantial \\ngovernmental interest existed and, if so, whether the \\nburden was narrowly tailored to advance that \\ninterest. Even assuming a legitimate and substantial interest, the Court concluded \\u201cthat purpose cannot \\nbe pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental \\n 25\\npersonal liberties when the end can be more \\nnarrowly achieved.\\u201d Id., at 716. New Hampshire \\nfailed that test. \\nIn still another line of cases, this Court found \\nthat it violated Constitutional protections to subject religious observants, who went door to door \\ndistributing religious materials and soliciting for the \\npurchase of religious books, to a government \\nsolicitation registration requirement. Murdock v. \\nPennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105 (1943); see also Follett v. \\nTown of McCormick , 321 U.S. 573 (1944). \\nAcknowledging that the practice was derived from the believer\\u2019s understanding that he was \\u201cobeying a \\ncommandment of God,\\u201d the Court found that the First Amendment prohibited the imposition of a \\ngenerally applicable registration requirement to \\nengage in such conduct. Murdock , 319 U.S., at 108, \\n117. Indeed, the Court went out of its way to describe the literature being distributed as \\u201cprovocative, \\nabusive, and ill-mannered.\\u201d Id., at 115\\u201316. \\nNevertheless, \\u201c[p]lainly  a community may not \\nsuppress . . . the dissemination of views because they \\nare unpopular, annoying or distasteful.\\u201d Id.,  at 116 \\nTo allow otherwise would \\u201cbe a complete repudiation of the philosophy of the Bill of Rights.\\u201d Id. \\nThe Court went further still , establishing that the \\nmere fact the religious materials were being \\u201csold\\u201d was not enough to transform \\u201cevangelism into a \\ncommercial enterprise.\\u201d Id., at 111. As such, the \\nCourt acknowledged heightened constitutional protections for \\u201cthose spreading their religious \\nbeliefs through the spoken and printed word.\\u201d Id. As \\ncompared to purely commercial activity, \\u201c[f]reedom of \\n 26\\npress, freedom of speech, fr eedom of religion are in a \\npreferred position.\\u201d Id., at 115. \\nEven Employment Division v. Smith , often \\ncriticized as having watered down constitutional \\nreligious liberty protections, recognized the Court\\u2019s \\nunique hostility toward burdens that implicate both \\nthe free exercise of religion and the freedom of \\nspeech. The \\u201cFirst Amendment bars application of a \\nneutral, generally applicable law to religiously \\nmotivated action\\u201d when that action \\u201cinvolve[s] not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but the Free \\nExercise Clause in conjunction with other \\nconstitutional protections, such as freedom of \\nspeech.\\u201d Empl. Div. v. Smith , 494 U.S. 872, 881\\u201382 \\n(1990). Even some preceden ts, decided on free speech \\ngrounds alone, were undoubtedly reinforced by \\ntouches of freedom-of-religion concerns. Id. \\n3. This much is clear: the arc of this Court\\u2019s \\nprecedent bends in one incontrovertible direction. \\nScrutiny of any government burden is at its zenith \\nwhen the burden effects an individual\\u2019s exercise of their religious beliefs in a manner that implicates \\nfree speech protections. This conclusion, rooted in the \\nhistory and tradition of religious exercise as \\nunderstood by the Founders and enshrined in the \\nFirst Amendment, demands that any such burden be \\nsubjected to the most rigorous application of strict \\nscrutiny analysis. \\nIt is precisely for this reason that, to the best of \\nAmicus Curiae\\u2019s knowledge, the Court has never \\nissued an opinion finding that governmentally \\ncompelled religious speech satisfies strict scrutiny. \\nSee 303 Creative Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Elenis , 6 F.4th \\n 27\\n1160, 1191 (U.S. 10th Cir. 2021) (Tymkovich, C.J., \\ndissenting) (\\u201c[T]he majority takes the remarkable\\u2014\\nand novel\\u2014stance that the government may force \\nMs. Smith to produce messages that violate her \\nconscience. . . . No case has ever gone so far.\\u201d). \\nThis case should not be the first. \\nIII. THE TENTH CIRCUIT \\u2019S OPINION CANNOT BE \\nSQUARED EITHER WITH THE FIRST \\nAMENDMENT \\u2019S RICH HISTORY OR THIS COURT \\u2019S \\nPROTECTION OF BELIEVERS \\u2019 FREE SPEECH \\nRIGHTS . \\nIn its permissive application of strict scrutiny, the \\nTenth Circuit bastardized this Court\\u2019s protection of free speech rights, especially as applied to religious \\nexpression. If allowed to stand, its precedent will give license to courts across this Country to \\nhumiliate members of all religious sects by \\ncompelling them to speak in contravention of their \\nsincerely held religious beliefs. By purporting to \\napply strict scrutiny, the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s opinion \\ncheapened the First Amendment rights of Catholics, \\nProtestants, Muslims, Jews, and all other believers alike. \\nLuckily, this precedent d oes not need to stand. \\nThis Court, once again, has an opportunity to \\nadmonish that the free speech protections of \\nbelievers are no less than non-believers and, in fact, \\nare heightened when faced with government \\nregulation that would compel speech antithetical to the tenants of a believer\\u2019s faith. The First \\nAmendment commands such a result. \\n 28\\nAlthough the Tenth Circuit rightly concluded that \\nMs. Smith\\u2019s website designs are \\u201cpure speech,\\u201d 303 \\nCreative LLC, 6 F.4th, at 1176, the Tenth Circuit \\nwrongly concludes that the commercial nature of Ms. \\nSmith\\u2019s speech gives Colorado a regulatory hook to \\nlatch onto. Id., at 1179. By failing to acknowledge the \\nreligious nature of her objection to the would-be compelled speech, the Tenth Circuit did not afford \\nher First Amendment rights the \\u201cpreferred\\u201d status \\nthey deserve.\\n5 Cf., Murdock , 319 U.S., at 115. What \\nis remarkable is that the religious nature of Ms. Smith\\u2019s objection is not disputed. See 303 \\nCreative, 6 F. 4th, at 1172 (Ms. Smith is \\u201cwilling to create custom graphics and websites for gay, lesbian, \\nor bisexual clients . . . so long as the custom graphics \\nand websites do not violate [her] religious beliefs, as is true for all customers.\\u201d (internal quotation marks \\nomitted)); id., at 1192 (Tymkovich, C.J., dissenting) \\n(\\u201cIn short, Colorado appear s to agree that Ms. Smith \\ndoes not distinguish between customers based on \\nprotected-class status and thus advances the aims of \\nCADA. But when any customer asks Ms. Smith to \\ncreate expressive content that violates her sincerely \\nheld beliefs, she will decline the request.\\u201d). \\n                                           \\n5 Remarkably, the Tenth Circuit  suggests that its sweeping \\nholding may not apply to \\u201call artists\\u201d if they were not engaged \\nin \\u201ccommercial activity,\\u201d but rather \\u201ccommissioning a mural for some charitable purpose.\\u201d 303 Creative , 6 F.4th, at 1182, n.6. To \\nsuggest that a local artist wh o refuses to paint a Christian \\nmural for a church may enjoy more constitutional protections \\nthan a woman called to live out her sincerely held religious \\nbeliefs by creating custom wedding websites is, thankfully, not supported by the history or tradition of the First Amendment \\nand the muscular protections it affords religious believers. \\n 29\\nThis failure is compounded by the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s \\nfallacy of a marketplace of one for Ms. Smith\\u2019s \\nspeech. Id. at 1180. Such convenient analysis \\nallowed the court to conclude \\u201cthere are no less intrusive means of providing equal access to those  \\ntypes of services.\\u201d Id. (emphasis added). But this \\nclever reasoning flips this Court\\u2019s precedent on its \\nhead. Rather than prioritize the religious speaker\\u2019s \\nobjection in search of a less restrictive means, the \\ncourt below merely concluded that she is the only one and therefore no other means will suffice. But, \\nwhere, as here, the government can achieve its interests without burdening religion, the \\nConstitution requires it to do so. Fulton , 141 S. Ct., \\nat 1881. The analysis is also anomalous in the free speech context because it cannot be that the more \\nunique and distinctive the speech, the less  First \\nAmendment protection it deserves. But that is the staggering breadth of the Tenth Circuit majority\\u2019s \\nconclusion. See 303 Creative , 6 F.4th, at 1204-05 \\n(Tymkovich, C.J., dissenting).  \\nMoreover, by categorizing Ms. Smith as nothing \\nmore than a \\u201cpublic accommodation,\\u201d the Tenth \\nCircuit minimized her right to participate in the \\nmarketplace, even as a woman of faith. See 303 \\nCreative, 6 F.4th, at 1181 (\\u201c[W]hether an exception limits market access depends upon the uniqueness of \\nthe public accommodation\\u2019s goods and services\\u2014not \\nthe sincerity of the public accommodation\\u2019s beliefs.\\u201d). \\nTo deny a benefit to those \\u201cwho engage in certain \\nforms of speech is in effect to penalize them for such \\nspeech,\\u201d and constitutionally, no different than \\nconditioning a benefit on a person\\u2019s \\u201cwillingness to \\nviolate a cardinal principle of her religious faith;\\u201d the \\n 30\\nresult is the same: to \\u201cdeter[] or discourage[] the \\nexercise of First Amendment rights of expression.\\u201d \\nSherbert , 374 U.S., at 405-06 (citing Speiser v. \\nRandall, 357 U.S. 513, 518 (1958)). Here too, Colorado seeks to impose the same constitutional \\nharm: speak in violation of your core religious faith \\nor lose the benefit of marketplace participation. Put \\nsimply, Colorado seeks to punish Ms. Smith for her \\nsincerely held religious beliefs. See also Trinity \\nLutheran Church , 137 S. Ct., at 2021\\u201322 (finding a \\nconstitutional violation where a burden puts \\nreligious believers \\u201cto a choice: [] participate in an \\notherwise available benefit\\u201d or maintain your \\nreligious identity). \\nThe same fundamental principle must apply to \\nfree speech and religious practices when they act in concert: \\u201cIn an open, pluralistic, self-governing \\nsociety, the expression of an idea cannot be \\nsuppressed simply because some find it offensive, \\ninsulting, or even wounding.\\u201d Fulton , 141 S. Ct., at \\n1924-25 (Alito, J., concurring). To lose this principle is to lose the \\u201cpreservation of religious freedom.\\u201d Id., \\nat 1925. That is because \\u201c[s]uppressing speech\\u2014or \\nreligious practice\\u2014simply because it expresses an idea that some find hurtful is a zero-sum game.\\u201d Id. \\nThis Court\\u2019s jurisprudence confirms this link \\nbetween religious exercise and free speech because \\nthis Court\\u2019s opinions \\u201cmake it perfectly clear that \\ndiscrimination against religious, as opposed to \\nsecular, expression is viewpoint discrimination.\\u201d \\nNurre v. Whitehead , 559 U.S. 1025, 1028 (2010) \\n(Alito, J., dissenting). And because viewpoint discrimination is \\u201can egregious form of content \\ndiscrimination,\\u201d Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of \\n 31\\nthe Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995), it brings \\nwith it heightened constitutional skepticism. \\nAlthough some may find Ms. Smith\\u2019s religious \\nbeliefs objectionable, \\u201creligions, and those who \\nadhere to religious doctrines, may continue to \\nadvocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by \\ndivine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be \\ncondoned.\\u201d Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U.S. 644, 679 \\n(2015). \\u201cAn open society can keep that promise while still respecting the \\u2018dignity,\\u2019 \\u2018worth,\\u2019 and fundamental equality of all members of the \\ncommunity.\\u201d Fulton , 141 S. Ct., at 1925 (Alito, J., \\nconcurring) (quoting Masterpiece Cakeshop , 138 S. \\nCt., at 1727). Ms. Smith should be free to practice all \\naspects of her faith, without fear of government-\\ncompelled expression against her sincerely held \\nreligious beliefs. The Constitution demands no less. \\nCONCLUSION \\n \\n\\u201c[T]here is before us the right of freedom to \\nbelieve, freedom to worship one\\u2019s Maker according to the dictates of one\\u2019s conscience, a right which the \\nConstitution specifically shelters.\\u201d Barnette , 319 \\nU.S., at 645 (Murphy, J., concurring). For this Court, there is \\u201cno loftier duty or responsibility than to \\nuphold that spiritual freedom to its farthest \\nreaches.\\u201d Id. \\nTo exclude Ms. Smith from offering her services\\u2014\\nsolely on the basis of her religious identity\\u2014would be \\n\\u201codious to our Constitution.\\u201d Trinity Lutheran \\nChurch , 137 S.

As part of that project, EPA has obtained emails and handwritten and typewritten notes under public records requests, which records on their face confess to the driving factor behind this liti-gation and similar litigation and inform the inquiry into federal versus state jurisdiction in this booming class of \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation filed in state courts. These records EPA obtained prompted it to file its first amicus  brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for \\nthe First Circuit, where removal of another among the growing number of \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d lawsuits filed \\nby governmental entities seeking billions of dollars \\nfrom private parties is pending.\\n2 That brief revealed \\ntwo sets of notes each purporting, independently, to record the assertion by an official with the governmen-tal plaintiff in that case, the State of Rhode Island, that the litigation seeks to obtain a \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d to underwrite that State\\u2019s spending ambitions, \\n \\n 1 Pursuant to Rule 37.6, counsel for Amicus  certifies that no \\ncounsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in part and that no person or entity other than Amici  or their counsel made a \\nmonetary contribution intended to fund the brief \\u2019s preparation or submission.

Petitioners fil ed a blanket consent for all such \\nbriefs on April 13, 2020. Respondent provided its written consent via email on April 29, 2020. \\n \\n2 See State of Rhode Island v. Shell Oil Products Co., LLC, et \\nal., Case No. 19-1818 (1st Cir.). Leave for EPA to file as amicus \\ncuriae  granted on March 26, 2020 \\n2 \\n after the State\\u2019s legislature declined to provide the de-\\nsired funds. Rhode Island\\u2019s confession was made at a meeting attended by \\u201ccabinet\\u201d-level representatives of numerous state governments from across the nation, including a representative from Maryland, and empha-sized the desire to pr oceed in state courts.\\n3 In that First \\nCircuit litigation, numerous  parties rely upon the \\nFourth Circuit\\u2019s decision in  the instant matter, and par-\\nties to the First Circuit litigation ad dressed the Fourth \\nCircuit\\u2019s opinion below in let ters of supplemental au-\\nthority pursuant to Fed. R. Ap p. Pro. 28(j). Because EPA \\nhas obtained records confe ssing the rationale behind \\nthe veritable tsunami of state-court \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d lawsuits such as the one now before this Court, and af-firming the plaintiffs\\u2019 emp hasis among peers and other \\npotential governmental plaint iff-recruits on using state \\ncourts for these actions with  national p olicy implica-\\ntions and avoiding the federal court system, EPA is keenly interested in this case and asks this Court to \\ngrant certiorari to address th e proper relationship be-\\ntween the state and federal court systems. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\n As important as climate policy is to both state and \\nfederal governments, equally and arguably more im-portant is the principle that the courts\\u2019 role is not to \\nmake policy judgments. This Court held in American \\nElectric Power v. Connecticut , 131 S. Ct. 2527, 2539, \\n \\n 3 A full list of attendees prepared by the organizers and ob-\\ntained under Colorado law is ava ilable at https://govoversight.org/ \\nwp-content/uploads/2020/01/Fulsome-list-of-participants.png. \\n3 \\n 564 U.S. 410, 426 (2011) that \\u201cthe federal courts would \\nhave no warrant to employ the federal common law of nuisance to upset\\u201d federal primacy in climate regula-tory policy. But rather than heed the American Electric \\nPower  opinion\\u2019s warnings that federal policy decisions \\nare to be made by Congress or by federal agencies ex-ercising properly delegated authority, certain litigants have instead attempted to end run that holding by seeking to create policy in state, rather than federal, courts. While federal courts ar e courts of limited juris-\\ndiction, in this matter the de cision below is based upon \\na series of cases that have eviscerated the jurisdiction of federal courts, even when important federal inter-ests are at stake. This is in conflict with the decisions of other Circuits, congressional action taken since these \\nFourth Circuit precedents were  adopted, and this Court\\u2019s \\nown rulings. Allowing the opin ion below to stand will \\ncause mischief in state courts across the nation. Re-cently obtained public records provide strong impetus to acknowledge, as a formal matter, that this \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation campaign is an impermissible use of the state courts, just as this Court previously held it \\nwas an impermissible use of the federal courts. This Court should prevent litigants from seeking the most favorable forum to obtain p olitical and policy ends by \\njudicial means. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\n  \\n4 \\n ARGUMENT \\nI. THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\\u2019S DECISION CON-\\nTRADICTS RECENT JURISPRUDENCE \\nAND LEGISLATION. THIS COURT SHOULD \\nGRANT CERTIORARI TO ENFORCE ITS OWN PRECEDENTS AND CONGRESSIONAL INTENT \\n The decision below, designated for publication and \\nwith the potential to shape or confuse the law for years \\nto come, is based on a series of precedents unique to the Fourth Circuit, many of which contradict more re-\\ncent holdings of this Court and even statutory changes \\nenacted by Congress. The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s reliance on its own, idiosyncratic precedents led to a result that is \\nin conflict with the holdings  of numerous other courts \\nand which will, if allowed to stand, result in mischief across the nation. \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision below, while pub-\\nlished only this year, has its foundations in a holding \\nfrom the 1970s that has been  adrift in changing legal \\nseas since then, and was implicitly swamped by a hold-ing of this Court twenty years ago. That Fourth Circuit \\nopinion, Noel v. McCain , 538 F.2d 633 (4th Cir. 1976), \\nheld that remand orders are essentially unreviewable unless they raise very narrow statutory grounds. Stare \\ndecisis  is an important legal principle, but in this case \\nthe Fourth Circuit\\u2019s adherence to its own precedents rather than those of this Court was misplaced. \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision below acknowledges \\nthat this Court subsequently interpreted the same \\n5 \\n statutory language differently in Yamaha Motor Corp., \\nU.S.A. v. Calhoun , 516 U.S. 199 (1996). More recently, \\nthe Seventh Circuit reached a contrary conclusion \\nabout the reviewability of di strict court orders to re-\\nmand in Lu Junhong v. Boeing Co. , 792 F.3d 805, 810\\u2013\\n13 (7th Cir. 2015). Even assuming, arguendo , that the \\nFourth Circuit properly decided the Noel  case in 1976, \\ncontinued reliance on Noel  is no longer appropriate. \\n It isn\\u2019t just precedent t hat has changed since the \\nFourth Circuit issued its opinion in Noel . Relevant \\nstatutory law has also changed: the Removal Clarifica-\\ntion Act of 2011, Pub. L. No. 112-51, 125 Stat. 545, clar-ified Congressional intent for federal courts to \\u201cclarify \\nand improve certain provisions relating to the removal \\nof litigation against Federal officers or agencies to Fed-\\neral courts.\\u201d \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision below (hereinafter \\n\\u201cBaltimore \\u201d), is based on foundations that Congress, \\nother federal courts, and this Court have steadily \\neroded since the Fourth Circu it issued the authority on \\nwhich Baltimore  rests. This Court, the Seventh Circuit, \\nand Congress itself have all spoken more recently. The \\ninnovative legal theories brought by the Plaintiffs in this case further highlight the need to decide the mat-\\nter based on current law. This Court should take the \\nopportunity to apply the Removal Clarification Act and resolve the split in the circuits that the Baltimore  opin-\\nion below aggravates. \\n \\n6 \\n II. IF THE DECISION BELOW STANDS, FED-\\nERAL COURTS WILL BE UNABLE TO PRE-\\nVENT FEDERAL POLICIES FROM BEING UNDERMINED AT THE STATE LEVEL \\n This suit is but one of many similar suits being \\nfiled all over the country. More than a dozen U.S. cit-\\nies, states and counties including the State of Rhode Island, City and County of Boulder (CO), City and \\nCounty of Honolulu (HI), City of New York (NY), \\nMarin, San Mateo and Santa Cruz Counties (CA), the cities of Imperial Beach, Oakland, Richmond, San \\nFrancisco, San Mateo, and Santa Cruz (CA), and King \\nCounty (WA), among others have filed similar claims against similar and generally the same defendants al-\\nleging similar causes of action which allegedly arise \\nunder state law. As at least one court has previously noted, multi-front litigation raises important concerns \\nabout the motivations of litigants. Chevron Corp. v. \\nDonziger , 974 F.Supp.2d 362, 475 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (\\u201cThe \\npoint of the multi-front strategy thus was to leverage \\nthe expense, risks, and bu rden to [defendant] of de-\\nfending itself in multiple jurisdictions to achieve a swift recovery, most likely by precipitating a settle-\\nment.\\u201d), later upheld at Chevron Corp. v. Donziger , 833 \\nF.3d 74 (2d Cir. 2016), cert. denied  at 137 S. Ct. 2268 \\n(2017). \\n This explosion in such cases filed in state court \\nseeks many hundreds of billions of dollars from private \\nparties, and seeks to enlist the defendants as advo-\\ncates in pressing for the plai ntiffs\\u2019 and their partners\\u2019 \\ndesired federal policies. Records obtained by Amicus  \\n7 \\n also show the attempt to us e the litigation to obtain \\ngovernmental revenues after that failed through the \\nappropriate, political process (see, infra ). Affirming the \\nimpropriety of this use of the courts as well as the ar-dent campaign by state and municipal plaintiffs to \\nkeep the matters away from the federal court and ex-\\nclusively before state courts, EPA has obtained emails and handwritten and typewritten notes under public \\nrecords requests, further discussed below, that illus-\\ntrate the danger of allowing st ate courts to interfere in \\nthis way in lawful interstate commerce conducted un-\\nder the auspices of the federal government. Key among \\nthese public records are two sets of notes each purport-ing, independently, to record the assertion by a senior \\nState of Rhode Island official that the objective of its \\nlitigation was to obtain a \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d for the State\\u2019s spending ambitions, in the face of a leg-\\nislature that does not share the executive\\u2019s priorities. \\n Both sets of notes record that official as emphasiz-\\ning the use of state courts to  obtain this funding denied \\nthem by the legislature. Other records, also noted, in-\\nfra, record the plaintiff \\u2019s legal counsel\\u2019s team, at least \\nsome of whom also represent the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore in this litigation,\\n4 lobbying gov-\\nernmental officials to join the campaign emphasizing the strategy of advancing this cause in the \\u201cmore ad-vantageous venue for these cases,\\u201d which plaintiffs confess is to be had in state courts. \\n \\n 4 The California law firm Sher Edling LLP represents both \\nthe State of Rhode Island in the First Circuit and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore in the Fourth Circuit. \\n8 \\n  These public records obtained through state open \\nrecords laws by Amicus  EPA represent a Rhode Island \\n\\u201ccabinet\\u201d-level official confiding to peers that the \\nState\\u2019s elected representatives are insufficiently moved by the plaintiff \\u2019s requests to enact laws raising \\nthe revenues the State\\u2019s executive desires; and that it \\nis thus \\u201clooking for [a] sustainable funding stream,\\u201d having been reduced to \\u201csuing big oil\\u201d for its \\u201cPriority \\n\\u2013 sustainable funding stream .\\u201d Notably, both sets of \\nnotes capture the State of Rhode Island as having em-phasized the \\u201cstate court\\u201d aspect of its plan. \\n These records, representing a similarly-situated \\nplaintiff \\u2019s confession, as recorded identically by two by \\nothers in the comfort of a presumably candid and off-\\nthe-record private meeting with peers and funders of \\u201cclimate\\u201d activism, leave little doubt that this growing \\nwave of state court \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation seeks \\nat least two impermissible objectives. First, this type of litigation seeks to use (state) courts to effectively \\ncreate federal energy and environmental policy. Sec-\\nond, in addition to using litigation as a stand-in for \\nthe political process that has denied state and munic-\\nipal plaintiffs their desired policies, it seeks to use lit-\\nigation to raise revenues having be en denied them \\nwhere revenues would properly be raised, which \\nagain is by the po litical process. \\n These public records provide strong impetus to \\nacknowledge, as a formal matter, that this \\u201cclimate \\nnuisance\\u201d litigation campaign is an impermissible use of the courts, seeking the most favorable forum to ob-\\ntain political ends by judicial means; that when filed \\n9 \\n they must remain in federal court; and that they \\nshould be dismissed for the same reasons. \\n \\nIII. PUBLIC RECORDS OBTAINED BY PRO-\\nPOSED AMICUS CURIAE  AFFIRM THIS \\nCASE BELONGS IN FEDERAL COURT \\n Amicus  EPA has obtained public records from Col-\\norado State University\\u2019s Center for a New Energy Economy (\\u201cCNEE\\u201d) under the Colorado Open Records \\nAct (\\u201cCORA\\u201d). Those records have now been brought to \\nthe attention of the First Circuit in related litigation, and are proper subject for judic ial notice by this Court. \\nSee Fed. Rule Evid. 201(b)(2). The records pertain to a \\ntwo-day meeting in July 2019 hosted by the Rockefel-ler Brothers Fund (\\u201cRBF\\u201d) at the Rockefeller family \\nmansion at Pocantico, NY. They include numerous \\nemails, agendas and other materials. Most pertinent, they also include a set of handwritten notes and a sec-\\nond, corroborating set of typewritten notes. According \\nto the public records themselves, the former was pre-pared by attendee Carla Frisch of the Rocky Mountain \\nInstitute (\\u201cRMI\\u201d), and the latter by attendee Katie \\nMcCormack of the Energy Foundation.\\n5 \\n \\n 5 These are available, respectively, at https://climatelitigationwatch. \\norg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Carla-Frisch-handwritten-notes- EPA_CORA1505.pdf and https:// climatelitigationwatch.org/ \\nwp-content/uploads/2020/03/EF-Katie-McCormack-typed-notes-EPA_CORA1542.pdf. These documents are identified in an August \\n20, 2019 email from CNEE\\u2019s Patric k Cummins transmitting them \\nto RBF\\u2019s Michael Northrop, Subject: meeting highlights, available at https://climatelitigationwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ \\n \\n10 \\n  This was a private event, styled \\u201cAccelerating \\nState Action on Climate Change,\\u201d if hosted as a forum \\nfor policy activists and a major funder to coordinate \\nwith senior public employees, e.g., a governor\\u2019s chief of staff and department secretaries and their cabinet \\nequivalents from fifteen states. These states included \\nFirst Circuit Plaintiff the State of Rhode Island, repre-sented by its Director of the Department of Environ-\\nmental Management, Janet Coit.\\n6 \\n These notes purport to contemporaneously record \\nthe comments of Director Coit discussing Rhode Is-\\nland\\u2019s entry in this litigation campaign, among peers. One passage in each set of no tes, attributed to Director \\nCoit and replicated almost verbatim in both, is partic-\\nularly striking and relevant, affirming two points that have become obvious and which should inform key de-\\ncisions confronting the judiciary in this \\u201cclimate nui-\\nsance\\u201d litigation campaign. \\n The records show RMI\\u2019s Frisch recorded Director \\nCoit speaking to this litigation as shown in the below \\n \\nEdited-notes-transmittal-email-CSU-suggests-Snail-mail-probably- \\ncovered-EPA_CORA1481_Redacted.pdf. \\u201cRBF CNEE climate pol-icy notes Jul 17 18.docx\\u201d are Katie McCormack\\u2019s notes (Energy Foundation); these appear to be produced as document EPA_ CORA1542.pdf, derived from Ms. McCormick\\u2019s transmittal email \\nbeing 1541, in which she describes her notes as long, and 1542 consists of 18 pages of notes;  \\u201cXerox Scan_07222019155622.pdf \\u201d \\nare Carla Frisch\\u2019s handwritten notes (this was produced as docu-ment EPA_CORA1505.pdf ). \\n \\n6 The participant list is availabl e at https://climatelitigation-\\nwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/List-of-Attendees-EPA_ CORA1037.pdf. \\n11 \\n excerpted image (Ms. Frisch\\u2019s notes are available in \\nfull at https://climatelitigationwatch.org/wp-content/ \\nuploads/2020/03/Carla-Frisch-handwritten-notes-EPA_ \\nCORA1505.pdf ). Ms. Frisch recorded Director Coit as saying, about this suit: \\nRI \\u2013 Gen Assembly D but doesn\\u2019t care on env/climate \\nlooking for sustainable funding stream \\nsuing big oil for RI damages in state court \\n \\n The first line-item attributes to Director Coit the \\nposition that the Rhode Island legislature is not per-suaded of the claims set fort h by the State in its litiga-\\ntion. This reluctance to politically impose the revenue-\\nraising measures (taxes) necessary for such funding streams is inherently shared among all \\u201cclimate nui-\\nsance\\u201d plaintiffs. The excerp t appears to also reflect \\nDirector Coit\\u2019s view of why the Rhode Island legisla-ture has thereby declined to obtain from the taxpayer, \\n\\n12 \\n and then appropriate to the State, the revenue streams \\nthat governmental Plaintiff Rhode Island desires. \\n This entry on its face represents a senior official \\nconfessing that Rhode Island\\u2019s climate litigation, es-\\nsentially identical to that in the Baltimore case below, \\nis in fact a product of Rhode Island\\u2019s elected represent-atives lacking enthusiasm for politically enacting cer-\\ntain policies, including reve nue measures, thus leaving \\nthe state \\u201clooking for [a] sustainable funding stream,\\u201d and so \\u201csuing big oil.\\u201d This characterizes all such gov-\\nernmental plaintiffs and su its including the matter \\nin the Fourth Circuit case which is the subject of the \\nPetition in this matter. \\n Fortunately, we can be confident that Ms. Frisch \\ndid not mishear Director Coit. The Energy Foundation\\u2019s \\nKatie McCormack provided RBF with a typewritten \\nset of her own notes transcribing the proceedings. To this Court\\u2019s further benefit, Ms. McCormack\\u2019s type-\\nwritten transcription of Director Coit\\u2019s commentary \\nreads almost verbatim as Ms. Frisch\\u2019s. \\n Ms. McCormack recorded Di rector Coit as saying: \\n* Assembly very conservative leadership \\u2013 don\\u2019t \\ncare about env\\u2019t \\n* If care, put it in the budget \\n* Priority \\u2013 sustainable funding stream * State court against oil/gas \\n13 \\n  \\n These notes on their face both affirm two realities \\nthat have become inescapable in recent years about this epidemic of \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation, all chan-neled into state courts (aft er the first generation of \\nsuits floundered in federal co urt, and ultimately were \\nterminated by this Court in American Electric Power v. \\nConnecticut , 131 S. Ct. 2527, 2539, 564 U.S. 410, 426 \\n(2011)).\\n7 That is that these suits seek to use the courts \\nto stand in for policymakers on two fronts. First, these suits ask the courts to substitute their authority for that of the political branches of government on matters of policy. Second, these suits seek billions of dollars in revenues, again the province of the political branches, for distribution toward political uses and constituen-cies. \\n O n  t h a t  fi r s t  c o u n t  o f  policymaking through the \\ncourts, the RBF meeting notes ratify a comment made to The Nation magazine by the plaintiffs\\u2019 tort lawyer credited with inventing this wave of litigation, Matt \\n \\n 7 See, e.g., Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp ., \\n663 F.Supp.2d 863 (N.D. Cal. 2009), upheld at  696 F.3d 849 (9th \\nCir. 2012). \\n\\n14 \\n Pawa. The magazine wrote, \\u201cAt the end of his speech, \\nSenator [Sheldon] Whitehouse [of Rhode Island] re-minded his colleagues of their \\u2018legislative responsibil-ity to address climate change.\\u2019 But it\\u2019s clear that too many lawmakers have abdicated, thus the pressure to tackle the climate issue thro ugh existing regulations \\nlike the Clean Air Act, and through the courts. \\u2018I\\u2019ve been hearing for twelve years or more that legislation is right around the corner that\\u2019s going to solve the global-warming problem, and that litigation is too long, difficult, and arduous a path,\\u2019 said Matthew Pawa, a climate attorney. \\u2018Legislation is going nowhere, so liti-gation could potentially play an important role.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n8 \\n Such use of the courts is of course improper but \\nalso informs a conclusion that these cases, when \\nbrought, belong in federal cour t, as well as that they \\nshould be dismissed for reasons including the inher-\\nently obvious, and now repeatedly confessed, purpose. \\n The second conclusion affirmed by these twice-\\nsourced assertions by the First Circuit plaintiffs is that \\nthis type of litigation is a grab for revenues, which again must properly be purs ued through the political \\nprocess. This is related to the first, in that, like policy, \\nsuch revenue-raising measures must be enacted by the voters\\u2019 elected representatives or approved directly by \\nvoters. Instead, with the desire for more \\u201cfunding \\nstreams\\u201d being yet another way the political process \\n \\n 8 Zoe Carpenter, The Government May Already Have the \\nLaw It Needs to Beat Big Oil , The Nation (July 15, 2015), \\nhttps://www.thenation.com/article/the-government-may-already-have-the-law-it-needs-to-beat-big-oil/. \\n15 \\n has failed such plaintiffs, we see them circumventing \\nthat process through this litigation campaign. \\n That the desire for more governmental revenue, \\nwithout adopting the necessa ry direct taxes for which \\nthere can be a political price to pay, was behind such \\nlitigation was suggested by the U.S. Chamber of Com-merce in a 2019 report enti tled \\u201cMitigating Munici-\\npality Litigation: Scope and Solutions,\\u201d published by \\nthe Chamber\\u2019s Institute fo r Legal Reform. That re-\\nport highlighted: \\n* \\u201cFor instance, local government leaders may \\neye the prospect of significant recoveries as a \\nmeans of making up for budget shortfalls.\\u201d \\n* \\u201cLarge settlements like those produced in the \\ntobacco litigation are alluring to municipali-\\nties facing budget constraints.\\u201d \\n* \\u201cSevere, persistent municipal budget con-\\nstraints have coincided with the rise of munic-ipal litigation agains t opioid manufacturers \\nas local governments are promised large re-\\ncoveries with no risk to municipal budgets by contingency fee trial lawyers.\\u201d \\n* \\u201cConclusion  A convergence of factors is propelling munici-\\npalities to file affirmative lawsuits against corporate entities. \\n There is the \\u2018push\\u2019 factor: municipalities face \\nhistoric budgetary cons traints and a public \\ninundated with news reports on the opioid cri-\\nsis, rising sea levels, and data breaches. And \\n16 \\n there is the \\u2018pull\\u2019 of potential multimillion-\\ndollar settlements and low-cost, contingency \\nfee trial lawyers. As a consequence, munici-\\npalities are pivoting to the courts by the thou-\\nsands.\\u201d9 \\n The National Association of Manufacturers\\u2019 Cen-\\nter for Legal Action has similarly argued that, \\u201cThe \\ntowns and lawyers have said that this litigation is \\nsolely about money. The towns want funding for local projects, and their lawyers are working on a contin-\\ngency fee basis, which means they aren\\u2019t paid if they \\ndon\\u2019t win.\\u201d\\n10 \\n The records EPA has obtained now provide docu-\\nmentary evidence to support these concerns that the courts are being exploited to balance municipal/state \\nbudgets and make policy decisions that legislators \\nhave declined to make. \\n \\n  \\n \\n 9 United States Chamber of Co mmerce, \\u201cMitigating Munici-\\npality Litigation: Scope and Solutions,\\u201d U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, March 2019, h ttps://www.instituteforlegalre-\\nform.com/uploads/sites/1/Mitigating-Municipality-Litigation-2019- Research.pdf, at p. 1, 6, 7 and 18, respectively. \\n \\n10 Manufacturers\\u2019 Accountability Project, \\u201cBeyond the Court-\\nroom: Climate Liability Litigation in the United States,\\u201d p. 2, https://mfgaccountabilityproject.or g/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ \\nMAP-Beyond-the-Courtroom-Chapter-One.pdf \\n17 \\n IV. HISTORIC CONCERNS ABOUT STATE \\nCOURT BIAS ARE AMPLIFIED IN CASES \\nOF THIS TYPE, SUCH THAT FEDERAL \\nCOURTS SHOULD STEP IN TO PROTECT \\nFEDERAL INTERESTS \\n A \\u201chistoric concern about state court bias\\u201d is the \\nunderlying basis allowing for federal officer removal. \\nSavoie v. Huntington Ingalls, Inc. , 817 F.3d 457, 461 \\n(5th Cir. 2016). The Supreme Court also recognizes bias as a concern justifying removal to federal court. \\n\\u201cState-court proceedings may reflect \\u2018local prejudice\\u2019 \\nagainst unpopular federal laws or federal officials.\\u201d Watson v. Philip Morris Cos. , 551 U.S. 142, 150 (2007). \\nBias exists, as these opinions acknowledge, and there \\nis no rational basis for declaring that such bias extends only to parties who are unpopular government offi-\\ncials. Indeed, this Court has  cautioned against \\u201cnarrow, \\ngrudging interpretation\\u201d of federal officer removal. Willingham v. Morgan , 395 U.S. 402, 407 (1969). \\nSimply put, \\u201c[t]he removal statute is an incident of fed-\\neral supremacy.\\u201d Murray v. Murray , 621 F.2d 103, 106 \\n(5th Cir. 1980). \\n States and municipalities are engaged in a cam-\\npaign through the courts to overturn \\u201cunpopular fed-\\neral laws.\\u201d Rather than recognizing the Constitution \\nand federal laws as supreme, governmental \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d plaintiffs are applying \\u201cnarrow, grudging\\u201d \\ninterpretation of the removal statute to seek to over-\\nturn federal law through imposing ostensible tort lia-bility in state courts. \\n18 \\n  It is hard to imagine a more striking case where \\nfear of state court bias could be a concern than is pre-\\nsented in the instant matter and similar cases unfold-\\ning across the nation. Stated otherwise and even more affirmatively, the hope  for state court bias is demon-\\nstrably at play in these case s, as shown in other records \\nobtained by Amicus  EPA through public records laws. \\n As documented, supra , by its own admission the \\nState of Rhode Island is pursuing its litigation to ob-tain a \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d for its officials\\u2019 \\nspending ambitions, having failed to convince the vot-\\ners\\u2019 elected representatives to provide one. Rhode Is-land\\u2019s circumstance in this respect differs not at all \\nfrom all such plaintiffs including in Baltimore . Both \\nsets of notes discussed, supra , specify Director Coit\\u2019s \\nemphasis on seeking this \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d \\nin \\u201cstate court.\\u201d All such plaintiffs are now moving \\nHeaven and earth to keep these matters out of the clutches of federal jurisdiction. \\n This objective of suing to make federal policy in \\nstate courts is a thematic cousin of the drive to use the \\ncourts when legislatures fail to enact plaintiffs\\u2019 desired \\npolicies, and is well-understood among the instant plaintiffs, Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, and by \\nthe legal teams for most similarly-situated govern-\\nment plaintiffs. That Rhode Island and the City of Bal-timore share not only claims and legal strategies but \\nlegal counsel, whose recruit ing team has emphasized \\nto targeted governmental entities the desire to keep these matters in state court as the \\u201cmore advantageous \\nvenue for these cases,\\u201d given this Court\\u2019s ruling in \\n19 \\n American Electric Power , raises concerns that the cli-\\nmate nuisance plaintiffs also  share the hope for state \\ncourt biases in the campaign to eliminate budgetary \\nshortfalls and otherwise make policy through tort liti-gation. \\n For example, and again turning to documents ob-\\ntained through open records laws, we see that, after \\nU.S. District Judge William Alsup dismissed the City \\nof Oakland\\u2019s \\u201cclimate nuisanc e\\u201d suit against many of \\nthe same defendants in June 2018,\\n11 a lobbyist hired to \\nassist with recruiting more governmental plaintiffs for \\nSher Edling12 passed along a note of encouragement to \\n \\n 11 City of Oakland, et al. v.

G. Seth \\nPlatt is one of the network\\u2019s cons ultants, engaged to help lobby \\nFlorida municipalities to file suit similar to the State\\u2019s. At the time of the correspondence cited herein, Platt was a registered lobbyist for the Institute for Gove rnance & Sustainable Development \\n(\\u201cIGSD\\u201d) (www.igsd.org) (see search able index of lobbying regis-\\ntrations at ftlweb01app.azurewebsites.us/Ethicstrac/Lobbyists.aspx). Platt worked with IGSD and others  pitching municipalities to file \\n\\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation against energy interests, with First Circuit and Fourth Circuit plaintiffs\\u2019 counsel Sher Edling. \\n On July 27, 2018 Fort Lauderdale Interim City Attorney \\nAlain Boileau wrote Mayor Dean Trantalis, copying other aides, in pertinent part: \\n\\u201cMayor . . .

(\\u201cLDF\\u201d) has strived to secure \\nthe constitutional promise of equality for all people. Petitioner asks the Court to reconsider an important question about the Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s reach, which, more than any other constitutional provision, \\nembodies our Nation\\u2019s commitment to equal justice \\nunder the law.  \\nLDF has been at the forefront of efforts to enforce \\nthe Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s promise of equality. See, e.g. , Cooper v. Aaron , 358 U.S. 1 (1958);\\n Brown v. \\nBd. of Educ. of Topeka , 347 U.S. 483 (1954) . LDF has \\nalso led the fight of eradicating discrimination from jury verdicts. See, e.g. , Ham v. South Carolina , 409 \\nU.S. 524 (1973)\\n; Alexander v. Louisiana , 405 U.S. 625 \\n(1972) ; Swain v. Alabama , 380 U.S. 202 (1965). \\nLDF submits this brief to aid the Court in \\ndeciding whether the Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s Due Process Clause incorporates the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement against the States.\\n1  \\n  \\n                                                \\n1 Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.6, counsel for amicus \\ncuriae state that no counsel for a party authored this brief in \\nwhole or in part and that no person other than amicus curiae , its \\nmembers, or its counsel made a monetary contribution to the preparation or submission of this brief. All parties have consented to the filing of this brief. \\n2 \\n \\n SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \\nAfter the Civil War, Congress passed the \\nFourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of \\n1875 to protect the rights of newly freed African \\nAmericans. One of the rights protected by those provisions was the right to  serve on a jury. Indeed, \\nthis Court affirmed the centrality of jury service to the citizenship of African Americans 140 years ago. See \\nStrauder v. West Virginia , 100 U.S. 303 (1879). \\nThen, in 1898, white Louisianans convened a \\nconstitutional convention. Their goal was to craft a constitution that would \\u201cestablish the supremacy of \\nthe white race . . . to the extent to which it could be \\nlegally and constitutionally done . . . .\\u201d Louisiana \\nratified its non-unanimous jury provision at this convention to help achieve its goal of cementing white supremacy. While federal law made it illegal to exclude Black people from jury service, the delegates \\npassed the non-unanimous jury provision to nullify \\nthe votes of Black jurors and allow white jurors to more easily convict Black defendants. \\nLouisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury provision \\nworked exactly as intended. Up until 2018, when \\nLouisianans voted to remove the non-unanimous jury \\nprovision from their constitution, Black defendants were more likely to be convicted by non-unanimous juries than white defendants, and Black jurors were more likely than white jurors to be in the dissent. \\nThus, despite jury service being a hallmark of \\nAmerican citizenship, for ov er a century, Louisiana\\u2019s \\n3 \\n \\n non-unanimous jury provision effectively undermined \\nBlack participation on juries. \\nLouisiana has been permitted to thwart the \\nintent of the Reconstruction Congress in this manner because of this Court\\u2019s decision in Apodaca v. Oregon , \\n406 U.S. 404 (1972), in which Justice Powell\\u2019s idiosyncratic view that the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement does not apply to the States \\nwas the controlling opinion. Th is is the rare case in \\nwhich stare decisis should not control, and this Court \\nshould hold that the Sixth Amendment requires state juries\\u2014like federal juries\\u2014to be unanimous. \\nARGUMENT \\nI. THE HISTORY OF THE FOURTEENTH \\nAMENDMENT COMPELS THE INCORPORATION OF THE SIXTH AMENDMENT UNANIMOUS JURY TRIAL \\nRIGHT.  \\nThis Court recently reiterated that \\u201c[a] Bill of \\nRights protection is inco rporated . . . if it is \\n\\u2018fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty,\\u2019 or \\n\\u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\\u2019s history and tradition.\\u2019\\u201d  \\nTimbs v. Indiana , 139 S. Ct. 682, 687 (2019) (quoting \\nMcDonald v. Chicago , 561 U.S. 742, 767 (2010)). \\nAccordingly, when determining whether a provision of the Bill of Rights is \\u201cfundamental\\u201d or \\u201cdeeply rooted,\\u201d the Court reckons with the historical context \\nof the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e.g. , McDonald , \\n561 U.S. at 770-78 (explicating the position of \\u201cthe \\n4 \\n \\n Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth \\nAmendment\\u201d); id. at 776 (relying on \\u201c[e]vidence from \\nthe period immediately following the ratification of \\nthe Fourteenth Amendment\\u201d); Timbs , 139 S. Ct. at \\n688 (same). An examination of this history compels the incorporation of the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement. \\nIn the aftermath of the Civil War, Southern \\nwhites were neither prepared nor willing to accept the \\n\\u201cfundamentally altered . . . racial status quo in the \\nSouth.\\u201d\\n2 The Thirteenth Amendment\\u2019s ratification \\nabolished slavery in 1865.3 Nevertheless, recalcitrant \\nSouthern states persisted in \\u201csubjugat[ing] newly \\nfreed slaves and maintain[ing] the prewar racial \\nhierarchy.\\u201d Timbs , 139 S. Ct. at 688. Between  1865 \\nand 1866, Southern legislatures accomplished this by passing discriminatory statutes, known as Black \\nCodes, which \\u201creduce[d] blacks to a status somewhere \\nbetween that of slaves (which they no longer were) \\nand full free people (which most white southerners opposed).\\u201d\\n4 And Black Codes governed a wide range of \\naspects of everyday life, including the extent of African American access to the courtroom.\\n5 For \\n                                                \\n2 Paul Finkelman, John Bingham and the Background to the \\nFourteenth Amendment , 36 Akron L.

Pol. & Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 389, 402-03 \\n5 \\n \\n example, under the Alabama Black Code, while Black \\npeople were allowed to testify in court, they were limited to testifying \\u201conly in cases in which freedmen, \\nfree negroes and mulattoes are parties.\\u201d\\n6  Other \\nstates passed similar Black Codes, all of which had the same effect: Black people could not testify in civil \\ncases between white people or in criminal cases in \\nwhich a white person harmed another white person.\\n7  \\n\\u201c[T]he law in effect declared that blacks were not \\n\\u2018equal\\u2019 to whites and that their testimony was not as \\u2018good\\u2019 as that of whites.\\u201d\\n8 \\nIt was against this backdrop of state-legislated \\nrefusal \\u201cto accept that the freed people were entitled \\nto liberty, equality, or even fundamental legal \\nrights,\\u201d9 that the need for Congress to create legal \\nprotections for formerly enslaved African Americans \\nbecame clear. In December 1865, Congress created \\nthe Joint Committee on Reconstruction, and \\nauthorized the Committee \\u201cto investigate conditions \\nin the South.\\u201d10  \\nThis investigation showed that with respect to \\nformerly enslaved Black people, \\u201cit was impossible to abandon them, without securing them their rights as \\n                                                \\n(2004).

As this Court said in Duncan v.

LOUISIANA\\u2019S NON-UNANIMOUS JURY \\nPROVISION WAS DESIGNED TO NULLIFY \\nBLACK JURY SERVICE.  \\nDespite the foregoing, a majority of this Court in \\nApodaca  held that the Fourteenth Amendment does \\nnot require the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity rule to \\nbe applied in state trials. In reaching that conclusion, \\nthe Court did not grapple with the racist history of \\nLouisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury provision.

Id. at 413. \\nJustice White could not \\u201cassume that the majority of \\nthe jury will refuse to weigh the evidence and reach a \\ndecision upon rational grounds . . . or that a majority will deprive a man of his liberty on the basis of prejudice when a minority is presenting a reasonable argument in favor of acquittal.\\u201d Id. Justice White \\n\\u201csimply [found] no proof for the notion that a majority \\nwill disregard its instructions and cast its votes for \\nguilt or innocence based on prejudice rather than \\nevidence.\\u201d Id. at 413-14.  \\nIn so reasoning, Justice White\\u2019s opinion does not \\nreckon with the overwhelming evidence that shows \\nLouisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury provision was \\nenacted with discriminatory intent and was designed to facilitate white jurors being able to convict Black defendants over the dissent of Black jurors.  \\nAfter Reconstruction ended and federal troops left \\nthe South, Louisianan Democrats called a \\n12 \\n \\n Constitutional Convention in 1898.33 As two scholars \\nof this period summarized, \\u201cthe sinister purpose of the Convention was to create a racial architecture in \\nLouisiana that could circumvent the Reconstruction \\nAmendments and marginalize the political power of black citizens.\\u201d\\n34 It was at this Convention that \\nLouisiana ratified its non-unanimous jury \\nprovision.35  \\nThe Convention\\u2019s official record is replete with \\nreferences to its racist goals. In his opening remarks, \\nConvention President Ernest Kruttschnitt stated that the \\u201cconvention has been called together by the people of the State to eliminate from the electorate the mass \\nof corrupt and illiterate voters who have during the \\nlast quarter of a century degraded our politics.\\u201d\\n36 The  \\ngoal, said Kruttschnitt, was the \\u201cpurification of the \\nelectorate.\\u201d37 The Judiciary Committee Chair, Judge \\nThomas Semmes, was more blunt.

The story of two Black Louisianans who recently served as jurors\\u2014Willie Newton and Bobbie Howard\\u2014compellingly illustrates this point.\\n64 \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard were both born and \\nraised in the small town of Houma, in Terrebonne Parish; the same town where Evangelisto Ramos \\nworked. Mr. Newton, who is 72 years old, runs a \\nfamily business selling burial vaults.

Everything quoted is from their interviews with counsel unless attributed otherwise. \\n19 \\n \\n year-old Mr. Howard has his own accounting practice. \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard both attended segregated schools growing up. In fact, they went to \\nthe same high school, as there was only one in the \\nParish that educated Black children. \\nIn 2014, two years before Mr. Ramos faced trial \\nfor second-degree murder, Mr. Newton and Mr. Howard were selected to serve on the jury for the trial \\nof Matthew Allen, a 20-year-old Black man also \\naccused of second-degree murder. The prosecution\\u2019s \\ntheory was that Mr. Allen intentionally shot and killed the victim; Mr. Allen\\u2019 s defense to the charge \\nwas that he acted in self-defense.\\n65 Mr. Newton and \\nMr. Howard were the only Black jurors. The other ten \\njurors on Mr. Allen\\u2019s jury were white.  \\nMr. Newton vividly recalled  his feelings when he \\nsaw the jury\\u2019s composition: \\u201cBobby and I saw from the beginning that our vote wasn\\u2019t going to matter. We \\nwere outnumbered.\\u201d \\u201cI could have just stayed home.\\u201d \\n\\u201cAin\\u2019t no difference we can make.\\u201d Mr. Newton felt \\ndoubly distraught when he saw that Mr. Allen had a \\u201cbad judge\\u201d who had been reprimanded for wearing blackface.\\n66 Mr. Newton thought to himself, \\u201cBuddy, \\nyou\\u2019re doomed.\\u201d \\n                                                \\n65 See State v. Allen , 2015-0675, 2015 WL 6951570, at *2 (La. Ct. \\nApp. 2015).  \\n66 In 2004, Judge Timothy Ellender was suspended for wearing \\nblackface, handcuffs, and a jail jumpsuit to a Halloween party.  \\nSee Seth Fox, Houma Judge Suspended for Wearing Blackface \\nHalloween Costume , Houma Today (Dec. 13, 2014), \\n20 \\n \\n Reflecting back, Mr. Newton and Mr. Howard \\nthought Mr. Allen\\u2019s race worked against him with the white jurors. \\u201cThey see a Black defendant in a drug \\ndeal and maybe think \\u2018he\\u2019s hustling corner to corner, \\nlet\\u2019s teach him a lesson,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Howard speculated. Mr. Newton echoed this sentiment: \\u201cI think they saw him \\nas a potential threat to the community.\\u201d  \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard looked at Mr. Allen \\ndifferently. They saw a young man who may have \\nmade a mistake, but who still had a life ahead of him. \\nMr. Howard thought these differing perspectives could be due to the fact \\u201ctheir life experiences were different.\\u201d  \\nAfter listening intently to the evidence, both Mr. \\nHoward and Newton favored finding Mr. Allen guilty of manslaughter. \\u201cI thought about his age. I thought he deserved a second chance,\\u201d Mr. Howard said quietly. Mr. Newton confirmed that he \\u201cnever thought \\nit was second-degree murder\\u201d and proposed to his \\nfellow jurors that Mr. Allen should be convicted of \\nmanslaughter, not murder.  \\nDeliberations gave both men hope that at least \\nsome of the white jurors would see the evidence their \\nway and would find Mr. Allen guilty of manslaughter, \\nnot murder. Mr. Howard recalled that one juror, a white woman, seemed to be leaning in favor of manslaughter going into lunch. Mr. Newton remembered there being two or three white jurors \\n                                                \\nhttps://www.houmatoday.com/article/DA/20041213/News/60809\\n9465/HC/.   \\n21 \\n \\n who seemed to think manslaughter was the just \\nconviction. \\nThings took a turn after lunch, however. Mr. \\nHoward recounted that he and Mr. Newton had lunch together, while the white jurors ate together. When they returned from lunch, all ten white jurors wanted to vote for second-degree murder; there was no convincing them otherwise, \\u201ceveryone was set in their \\nways.\\u201d  \\nMr. Newton\\u2019s prediction that his vote wouldn\\u2019t \\nmatter proved prescient. Th e jury convicted Mr. Allen \\nof second-degree murder by a vote of 10-2. All ten \\nwhite jurors voted for guilt. Mr. Newton and Mr. \\nHoward voted not guilty. \\nWhat took place troubled Mr. Howard and Mr. \\nNewton. Mr. Howard recalled: \\u201cI pretty much felt sorry for the young man, to tell you the truth.\\u201d Mr. \\nNewton was more shaken: \\u201cIt hurt me real bad when \\nI looked at that young man, and I looked at his mother and father, and I knew they weren\\u2019t going to see him again, not unless they go up to Angola.\\u201d\\n67 Indeed, Mr. \\nNewton felt the effects of the trial long after it was \\nover: \\u201cWhen I left that jury, it took me a couple of \\nweeks to get myself together. Serving on that jury \\ntook something out of me.\\u201d Mr. Allen, who entered prison for a crime he a when he was only 20, continues to serve a life sentence in Angola Prison.   \\n                                                \\n67 Adelson et al., supra note 57. \\n22 \\n \\n Mr. Newton realized that what happened in Mr. \\nAllen\\u2019s trial probably happened in many others, causing him to wonder, \\u201cHow many others had passed \\nthis way . . . and got the same treatment this boy got.\\u201d \\nThe trial, Mr. Newton explained, made him feel like his \\u201cvoice didn\\u2019t matter,\\u201d \\u201ca second-class citizen.\\u201d  \\nThis experience confirmed for Mr. Newton that \\nLouisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury system was unfair to \\nBlack defendants and Black jurors. In his opinion, the \\nprosecutors \\u201cfound a way to get around the system\\u201d \\nby limiting the number of Black people on Mr. Allen\\u2019s jury to two, knowing they only needed ten votes for a conviction. The trial shook Mr. Newton\\u2019s confidence in \\nthe fairness of Louisiana\\u2019s justice system: \\u201cI know I \\ncouldn\\u2019t sit there and think I\\u2019d get a fair trial.\\u201d  \\nMr. Newton took solace in the fact Louisiana \\nvoters repealed the non-unanimous jury provision last year.\\n68 He expressed that while he does think that \\n\\u201cjustice was served\\u201d during Mr. Allen\\u2019s trial, he felt \\n\\u201cencouraged\\u201d and \\u201cempowered\\u201d to serve on a jury now that his vote was guaranteed to matter. Mr. Howard \\nsaid that he, too, is ready to perform his \\u201ccivic duty\\u201d \\nand serve on a jury under Louisiana\\u2019s new unanimous jury scheme.  \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard\\u2019s experience is a \\nstark example of the indign ities inflicted upon Black \\npeople by Louisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury provision. It is a reminder that, until last year, Louisiana\\u2019s non-\\nunanimous jury system worked the way its racist \\n                                                \\n68 Oregon is now the only state with a non-unanimous jury \\nprovision. \\n23 \\n \\n proponents intended\\u2014to more easily convict Black \\ndefendants and to silence Black jurors. What makes this even worse, is that this system, conceived from \\nracism, has been operating with this Court\\u2019s blessing \\nfor 47 years. Apodaca must be overruled. This Court \\nshould hold that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity \\nrequirement against the States.  \\n \\n  \\n24 \\n \\n CONCLUSION \\nLDF respectfully urges this Court to hold that the \\nFourteenth Amendment incorporates the Sixth \\nAmendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement against the States.  \\nRespectfully submitted,  \\n \\nSherrilyn A.

While debating the extent to \\nwhich the Constitution should enshrine protections for religious freedom during the First Congress, \\nRepresentative Daniel Carroll of Maryland\\u2014one of \\nthe few Catholics among the Constitution\\u2019s \\nFramers\\u2014remarked \\u201cthe rights of conscience are, in \\ntheir nature, of peculiar delicacy, and will little bear \\nthe gentlest touch of governmental hand.\\u201d 1 Annals \\nof Cong. 757-58 (Joseph Gales ed., 1834) (Aug. 15, 1789). \\nNowhere are the rights of the religious more \\ndelicate than when they intersect with the freedom \\nto put faith into action, belief into words. If the \\nrobust religious freedom protections guaranteed by \\nour Constitution are to have any meaning, they must \\nbe capable of shielding a sincere religious believer from being coerced into speaking against the core \\ntenants of her faith. To hold otherwise would be to \\npermit the heavy hand of government to extinguish \\nreligious practice. This the Constitution will not \\nallow. \\nThe Founders understood that the First \\nAmendment, as drafted, protected all religious sects in their right to speak freely in accordance with their \\nfaith. Indeed, the Founding Generation believed \\nprotections for religious lib erty to be of utmost \\nimport. Since its founding, America has been gripped \\n 3 \\nin debate over religious liberty. Even before the \\ncolonies declared their independence, there were \\nenergetic discussions over the bounds of religious \\ntoleration versus a full freedom to exercise religion \\n(with only limited exceptions). Ultimately, the \\nConstitution\\u2019s drafters settled on James Madison\\u2019s \\nview of an unalienable right to practice one\\u2019s \\nreligious faith. Owed to an understanding that the Governor of the Universe supersedes any earthly \\nauthority, religious convictions were understood to \\ncommand greater deference than mere personal \\nopinions. Where opinion was required to yield to the \\nlaw, tensions between law and religious belief often \\nresulted in exemption for the believer. \\nThe Founding Generation also viewed religious \\nliberty as encompassing more  than mere matters of \\nconscience or decisions on the rightness or wrongness \\nof acts. Instead, the full ex ercise of religion offered a \\nright to act in accordance with one\\u2019s faith and, \\nnecessarily, included protection from government \\ncompelled speech that violated a believer\\u2019s firmly \\nheld religious convictions. This distinction was \\nperhaps most clearly expressed in the early colonies\\u2019 \\nanti-Catholic prejudices. In colonial Georgia, for example, while all worshipers were vested by its \\nCharter with a liberty of conscience, Catholics were \\nexpressly excluded from protections for the more \\nrobust free exercise of religion. McConnell, The \\nOrigins and Historical Understanding of Free \\nExercise of Religion, 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1409, 1489-90 \\n(1989) (hereinafter McConnell, Origins). \\nInformed by the debates and experiences of their \\ntime, the Founders opted to include among the Constitution\\u2019s protections the more extensive free \\n 4 \\nexercise of religion. In so doing, they extended the \\nmaximum protections available to all who professed \\nbelief in a Universal Sovereign. These protections, it \\nwas understood, included a right to act out belief and \\nto speak, or refrain from speaking, freely, in \\naccordance with faith. \\nWith this understanding as background, it is \\nclear the First Amendment provides dual protections for religious expression (or non-expression) in its \\nguarantees of free speech and free religious exercise. \\nThis reality compels the \",\n          \" \\n No. 19-1189 \\n================================================================================================================ \\nIn The \\nSupreme Court of the United States \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 --------------------------------- \\nBP P.L.C., et al., \\nPetitioners,        \\nv. \\nMAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE, \\nRespondent.        \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 --------------------------------- \\nOn Petition For Writ Of Certiorari \\nTo The United States Court Of Appeals \\nFor The Fourth Circuit  \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 --------------------------------- \\nBRIEF OF AMICUS CURIAE  \\nENERGY POLICY ADVOCATES \\nIN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS \\nFILED BY CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 --------------------------------- \\nMATTHEW  D.

Religious observers have \\nwelcomed the relief from government oppression. No \\nlonger can religious believers be excluded solely \\nbecause of their religious identity. Free are the religious to express their religious views without fear \\nof government reprisal. This Court\\u2019s precedents have \\nbeen unequivocal: if government can achieve its \\nmeans without burdening religion, the Constitution \\nalmost always requires that it must. \\nAnother truism is derived from this Court\\u2019s \\nprecedents. When religious liberty concerns are coupled with free expression, the Constitution \\ndemands the most exacting scrutiny. That is because \\nthe First Amendment, as understood from the \\nFounding, provides special protection for the \\n 5 \\nreligious, their right to speak freely, and their right \\nto refrain from speaking. Distinct from pure \\ncommercial speech, religious speech demands a \\nhigher constitutional protection. That is why, to \\nAmicus Curiae\\u2019s knowledge, government compelled \\nreligious speech has never been held to survive strict \\nscrutiny. \\nAgainst this backdrop, the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s opinion \\ncannot stand. Although purporting to apply strict scrutiny, the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s analysis is rife with \\nflaws, each one fatal to the court\\u2019s conclusion. From \\nthe outset, the Tenth Circuit failed to recognize the \\npreferred status of Ms. Smith\\u2019s free speech rights, \\ngrounded as they are in her religious beliefs. This \\nfailure is only compounded by the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s lethargic narrow-tailoring analysis. Far from the \\nexacting analysis this Court requires, the Tenth \\nCircuit settles into a now familiar pattern to those of \\nfaith\\u2014ostracizing Ms. Smith from society because of \\nher religious identity. \\nOnce again, this Court must reverse yet another \\nassault on religious freedom by declaring that where, as here, free speech and religion intersect, \\nconstitutional protections are at their greatest. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 6 \\nARGUMENT \\nI. AS ORIGINALLY UNDERSTOOD , THE FIRST \\nAMENDMENT PROTECTED THE RIGHT OF THE \\nRELIGIOUS TO SPEAK AND TO REMAIN SILENT . \\nThe First Amendment is \\u201cunique in form among \\namendments to the Constitution.\\u201d2 It is drafted, not \\nas a grant of privileges or rights to the people, but as \\na disability on Congress\\u2019 ability to act. Report to the Attorney General, supra  note 2, at 15\\u201316. In its \\nentirety, the First Amendment reads: \\nCongress shall make no law respecting \\nan establishment of religion, or \\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; or \\nabridging the freedom of speech, or of \\nthe press; or the right of the people \\npeaceably to assemble, and to petition \\nthe Government for a redress of grievances.  \\nU.S.\\n Const., Amdt. 1. \\nIn barring certain kinds of laws, the First \\nAmendment recognizes a pre-existing \\u201cimmun[ity] from such legislative action.\\u201d Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral, supra note 2, at 16. This reflects an \\nunderstanding by the Founding Generation that these \\u201care pre-existent rights\\u2014inalienable rights\\u2014\\n                                           \\n2 O f f i c e  o f  L e g a l  P o l i c y ,  D e p t  o f  J u s t i c e ,  R e p o r t  t o  t h e  \\nAttorney General: Religious Li berty Under the Free Exercise \\nClause at 15 (1986) (hereinafter Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral). \\n 7 \\nand not mere civil privileges conferred by a \\nbenevolent sovereign.\\u201d Id. \\nTaken together, the text, history, and philosophy \\nof the First Amendment establish the principle that \\n\\u201cthe government has no right to interfere with the \\nfree exercise of religion\\u201d unless the \\u201cgovernment \\naction is necessary to prevent manifest danger to the \\nexistence of the state; to protect public peace, safety, \\nand order; or to secure the religious liberty of \\nothers.\\u201d Id., at v. And, even then, only if the \\ngovernment deploys \\u201cthe least restrictive means \\nnecessary to protect these interests.\\u201d Id. This is true \\nas a matter of the First Amendment\\u2019s Religious Liberty Clauses. And because freedom of religion \\ncannot be divorced from freedom of expression, it is \\neven more true when the government tries to force a \\nbeliever to speak in a way that cannot be reconciled \\nwith her religious convictions. \\nA. Religious liberty was profoundly \\nimportant to the Founding Generation; \\nreligious convictions were understood \\nto receive greater deference than mere \\npersonal opinion. \\n1. The Founding Generation was uniquely \\nattuned to issues regarding the proper relationship \\nbetween religion and government. Indeed, at the time of America\\u2019s founding there was \\u201can intense and \\ncontroversial theoretical debate\\u201d of these issues \\ninvolving \\u201c[m]ost of the great political thinkers of the \\nperiod.\\u201d McConnell, Origins, at 1430. These thinkers \\ninformed the Founders\\u2019 own debates on the issue and \\nundoubtedly \\u201cinfluenced the American solution to \\nthe problem.\\u201d Id.  \\n 8 \\nJohn Locke, perhaps more than any other \\nphilosopher who contributed to the ideas \\nunderpinning America\\u2019s founding, provided the \\n\\u201cmost extensive\\u201d discussion of religion and most \\ndirectly influenced the Framers\\u2019 drafting of the First \\nAmendment. Id. Locke was an early and influential \\ntheoretical thinker and advocate for religious freedom. Id., at 1431. In his view \\u201creligious rivalry \\nand intolerance\\u201d were \\u201camong the most important of political problems,\\u201d and \\u201c[r]eligious intolerance was inconsistent both with public peace and with good \\ngovernment.\\u201d Id. \\nLocke\\u2019s solution, however, was an \\u201cunderstanding \\nof religious toleration,\\u201d that \\u201cexpressly precludes free \\nexercise exemptions.\\u201d Id., at 1435. To Locke, when \\n\\u201cindividual conscience conflicts with the governmental policy, the government will always \\nprevail and the individual will always be forced to \\nsubmit or suffer the punishment.\\u201d Id. Locke\\u2019s \\ninfluence on the drafters of the First Amendment makes it all the more remarkable that his view did \\nnot triumph with America\\u2019s founding. \\nThe American Revolution upended the \\npreexisting relationship between religion and government, especially in states where the Anglican \\nChurch had the most influence. Id., at 1436. \\n\\u201cAmerica was in the wake of a great religious \\nrevival,\\u201d that brought with it a \\u201cdrive for religious \\nfreedom.\\u201d Id., at 1437\\u201338. Along with this drive came \\na push from \\u201creligious supporters of disestablishment and free exercise\\u201d to enshrine \\n\\u201cconstitutional protections\\u201d for religious freedoms \\u201cat the federal level.\\u201d Id., at 1440. \\n 9 \\nThis movement was encapsulated in debate \\nsurrounding the religious liberty clause in Virginia\\u2019s \\n1776 Bill of Rights. When George Mason proposed \\nusing the Lockean phrase \\u201ctoleration of religion,\\u201d \\nJames Madison objected, complaining that the \\nphrase implied an act of legislative grace (which, to \\nLocke, it did). Id. , at 1443. Madison was not alone \\namong the Founding Generation in rejecting this concept. George Washin gton and Thomas Paine \\nsimilarly eschewed \\u201ctoleration,\\u201d decrying its \\nimplication of government \\u201cindulgence\\u201d rather than a \\nfundamental, preexisting right. Id., at 1443\\u201344. \\nMoreover, Madison objected to Mason\\u2019s proposal \\nbecause it excepted from even the \\u201ctoleration\\u201d of \\nreligious freedom any instance where \\u201cunder color of \\nreligion any man disturb the peace, the happiness, or \\nsafety of society.\\u201d See G. Hunt, James Madison and \\nReligious Liberty, 1 Ann. Rep. Am. Hist. A. 163, 166 \\n(1901). It was Madison\\u2019s belief that such phrasing \\n\\u201cmight easily be so twisted as to oppress religious \\nsects under the excuse that they disturbed \\u2018the \\npeace, the happiness, or safety of society.\\u2019\\u201d Id. \\nMadison\\u2019s objections were heard by Virginia\\u2019s \\nassembly. As adopted, Virginia\\u2019s Bill of Rights \\npromised that all \\u201care equally entitled to the free \\nexercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience,\\u201d and reminded only \\u201cthat\\n it is the mutual \\nduty of all to practice Christian forbearance, love, and charity towards each other.\\u201d Report to the \\nAttorney General, supra  note 2, at 102\\u201303. \\n2. This early debate between Madison and Mason \\nbears witness to what this Court has long noted\\u2014\\nthat Madison was \\u201cthe leading architect of the \\n 10\\nreligion clauses of the First Amendment.\\u201d Hosanna-\\nTabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v. \\nEEOC , 565 U.S. 171, 184 (2012) (internal quotation \\nmarks omitted). Madison\\u2019s rejection of religious \\ntolerance in favor of full and free religious expression permeates his Memorial and Remonstrance . \\nExplaining that \\u201c[t]he Religion then of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every \\nman,\\u201d Madison understood that it is not just \\u201cthe \\nright of every man to exercise it as these may \\ndictate,\\u201d but further \\u201cthe duty of every man to render \\nto the Creator such homage, and such only, as he \\nbelieves to be acceptable to him.\\u201d J. Madison, \\nMemorial and Remonstrance \\u00a7 1 (1785), reprinted in \\nEverson v. Bd. of Educ. , 330 U.S. 1, 64 (1947). This \\nright, Madison admonished, \\u201cis in its nature an unalienable right.\\u201d Id. \\nMadison expounded his view that \\u201c[t]his duty is \\nprecedent both in order of time and degree of \\nobligation, to the claims of Civil Society.\\u201d Id. Before \\nanyone is \\u201ca member of Civil Society,\\u201d they are \\u201cconsidered as a subject of the Governor of the \\nUniverse.\\u201d Id. For this reason, \\u201cin matters of \\nReligion, no man\\u2019s right is abridged by the institution of Civil Society.\\u201d Id. But Madison went \\nfurther. \\u201c[I]f religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that \\nof the Legislative Body.\\u201d Id., at \\u00a7 2, reprinted in \\nEverson , 330 U.S., at 65. Legislators who \\n\\u201cencroach[]\\u201d on the rights of the people, Madison \\nsaid, \\u201cexceed the commission from which they derive their authority, and are Tyrants.\\u201d Id. \\nRecognizing that Madison\\u2019s Memorial and \\nRemonstrance is not law, see City of Boerne v. Flores , \\n 11\\n521 U.S. 507, 541 (1997) (Scalia, J., concurring), it \\nnonetheless offers a clear understanding of why the \\nFounding Generation thought it so crucial to \\nmemorialize the inalienable freedom of religion in \\nthe First Amendment. And Madison\\u2019s defense of the \\nAmerican conception of religious liberty merely \\nechoed the prevalent thought at the founding \\u201cof the \\ndifference between religious faith and other forms of human judgment.\\u201d McConnell, Origins, at 1496. \\nAt the Founding, the prevailing view was that the \\n\\u201copinions of individuals\\u201d can not take \\u201cprecedence \\nover the decisions of civil society.\\u201d Id. The same was \\nnot true for religious convictions. \\u201cConflicts arising from religious convictions were conceived not as a \\nclash between the judgment of the individual and of \\nthe state, but as a conflict between earthly and \\nspiritual sovereigns.\\u201d Id. In those instances, the \\nperson holding the religious conviction \\u201cwas not seen as the instigator of the conflict; the believer was simply caught between the inconsistent demands of \\ntwo rightful authorities, through no fault of his own.\\u201d \\nId. This view is essential to understanding the \\nFounders\\u2019 belief that \\u201cfreedom of religion is unalienable because it is a duty to God and not a \\nprivilege of the individual.\\u201d Id., at 1497. \\n3. Bolstering this understanding, the historical \\nrecord surrounding adoption of the Bill of Rights \\nsuggests that the First Amendment\\u2019s use of the term \\u201creligion\\u201d was a deliberate choice. See McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1488. Although \\u201c[t]he recorded debates \\nin\\u201d both chambers of Congress \\u201ccast little light on the \\nmeaning of the free exercise clause,\\u201d looking at \\nsuccessive drafts of the clause from its consideration \\nand debate in the First Congress are especially \\n 12\\nenlightening. Id., at 1481, 1483. While earlier drafts \\nof the First Amendment used the phrase \\u201crights of \\nconscience,\\u201d the final version that emerged enshrined in the First Amendment a protection for the \\u201cfree \\nexercise of religion.\\u201d Id., at 1488. This phrasing lends \\nfurther support to the Founders\\u2019 understanding of religious freedoms. \\nTo the Founders, \\u201c[b]elief in a Supreme Being \\nwas\\u201d essential to \\u201creligion.\\u201d Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral, supra  note 2, at 9. Indeed, \\u201c[t]he historical \\nmaterials uniformly equate \\u2018religion\\u2019 with belief in God or in gods.\\u201d McConnell, Origins, at 1493. These references \\u201ccan be extended without distortion to \\ntranscendent extrapersonal authorities not \\nenvisioned in traditionally theistic terms\\u201d\\u2014for \\nexample, Madison\\u2019s use of \\u201cCreator,\\u201d \\u201cGovernor of \\nthe Universe,\\u201d and \\u201cUniversal Sovereign,\\u201d imply \\u201can attempt at a definition more compendious than the \\nfamiliar Judeo-Christian God, but it retains the distinction between transcendent authority and \\npersonal judgment.\\u201d Id.  \\nReligion, as understood by the Founders and \\nexpressed in the First Amendment, then, is best \\ndefined to encompass \\u201ca system of beliefs, whether \\npersonally or institutionally held, prompted by the \\nacceptance of transcendent realities or \\nacknowledging extratemporal actions.\\u201d Report to the \\nAttorney General, supra note 2, at 26\\u201327. This \\ninterpretation of religion is both accurate to the Founders\\u2019 understanding and consistent with their view that religion encompasses \\u201cduties that were \\nbeyond the jurisdiction of the state either to \\nprescribe or to proscribe.\\u201d Id., at 9. To the Founders, \\nreligion encompassed a subservience to a \\n 13\\n\\u201ctranscendent reality,\\u201d which if abandoned could \\nunleash \\u201cextratemporal consequences.\\u201d Id., at 29. \\nThis explains their motivation to preserve a robust freedom from government \\u201cinterfere[nce] with such \\nbeliefs or duties.\\u201d Id. \\nB. The Founding Generation\\u2019s understanding of religious liberty \\nencompassed protection for believers \\nfrom compelled speech that violates \\nfirmly held religious beliefs. \\n1. The least controversial point about the phrase \\n\\u201cfree exercise\\u201d is that \\u201cby definition, the words denote action or activity.\\u201d Id., at 19. To the Founders, \\nreligious liberty undoubtedly included \\u201creligiously motivated conduct  as well as belief.\\u201d McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1488 (emphasis added). This point bears emphasis because of this Court\\u2019s history rejecting \\nsuch a reading. See  Reynolds v. United States , 98 \\nU.S. 145, 164 (1878); but see Fulton v. City of Phila. , \\n141 S. Ct. 1868, 1913 (2021) (Alito, J., concurring) \\n(noting \\u201c[t]he Court ha[s] repudiated that distinction\\u201d in Reynolds  \\u201cthat the Free Exercise \\nClause protects beliefs, not conduct\\u201d). \\nIn substituting the \\u201crights of conscience\\u201d in favor \\nof a protection for the \\u201cfree exercise of religion,\\u201d the \\nFramer\\u2019s chose a phrase that \\u201cstrongly connoted \\naction,\\u201d in place of one that suggested mere opinion \\nor belief. McConnell, Origins, at 1489. Leading \\ndictionaries of that era defined \\u201cexercise\\u201d to include \\n\\u201c[l]abour of the body,\\u201d \\u201c[t]ask; that which one is \\nappointed to perform,\\u201d \\u201c[a]ct of divine worship, \\nwhether public or private,\\u201d or \\u201c[t]o use or practice.\\u201d See id.  (collecting dictionary definitions). Conscience, \\n 14\\non the other hand, was more likely to imply a \\n\\u201cnatural knowledge, or the faculty that decides on \\nthe right or wrong of actions.\\u201d Id. (quoting N. \\nWebster, A Dictionary of The English Language 301 (New Haven 1807)). \\nParticularly instructive on this distinction is the \\nGeorgia Charter of 1732. The Charter included \\u201ca \\nliberty of conscience allowe d in the worship of God, \\nto all persons,\\u201d but reserved the more exclusive right to \\u201ca free exercise of religion,\\u201d only to \\u201call such persons, except papists.\\u201d Id., at 1489\\u201390. By granting \\nCatholics only a liberty of conscience, but not the free exercise of religion, the Georgia Charter necessarily \\nreserved a fuller right to non-Catholic worshipers. \\nOne scholar has observed that \\u201c[t]he most plausible \\nreading of the provision is that it permitted Catholics \\nto believe what they wished . . . but did not permit \\nthem to put their faith into action.\\u201d Id., at 1490. \\nBy including a full and robust \\u201cfree exercise of \\nreligion\\u201d within the First Amendment, the Founders understood that they were protecting not only the \\nright for the religious to believe what their faith \\ntaught, but to put those beliefs into action. To \\nconclude otherwise would be to \\u201ctrivialize the idea of \\nreligion by separating thought from life, faith from \\nworks.\\u201d Report to the Attorney General, supra note \\n2, at 31. Possessing \\u201ca right to believe something in one\\u2019s mind without the freedom to utter it, advocate it, or even translate it into life,\\u201d is hardly a \\nsubstantive freedom at all. Id., at 31\\u201332. \\n2. Consistent with the Founders\\u2019 understanding \\nof a robust religious liberty protection that included \\nthe right to act out your faith was the axiom that \\n 15\\naction naturally includes expression or the freedom \\nto refrain from expression that conflicts with belief. \\nAlthough early religious liberty controversies were \\nrelatively limited, the historical record includes \\nexamples of protections for religious exercise \\nintertwined with such expressive activity. \\nAn early source of common conflict, for example, \\narose around the issue of oath requirements. Oaths \\nserved as \\u201cthe principal means of ensuring honest \\ntestimony and solemnizing obligations.\\u201d McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1467. But many early religious sects \\nrefused to take an oath, believing it was in conflict \\nwith the teachings of the New Testament.3 Id. \\nBecause oaths were required before court testimony, this refusal often left these sincere religious objectors \\nwithout access to the court system. Id. \\nIn response, many of the early colonies adopted \\nalternatives, allowing relig ious dissenters to take a \\npledge or make an affirmation rather than to swear \\nan oath. Id., at 1467\\u201368 (\\u201cBy 1789, virtually all of the \\nstates had enacted oath exemptions.\\u201d). This simple solution permitted religious sects access to the court \\nsystem, without requiring them to act out of step \\n                                           \\n3 See Matthew 5:33-37 (\\u201cAgain, ye have heard that it hath \\nbeen said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, \\nbut shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: But I say unto you, \\nSwear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: Nor \\nby the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is \\nthe city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy \\nhead, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever \\nis more than these cometh of evil.\\u201d). \\n 16\\nwith their religious beliefs or to make an expression \\nthey found incompatible with their faith. \\nA still more extreme example of laws yielding to \\nexpressive activities of religious sects in the \\nFounding Generation can be found in colonial \\nGeorgia. There, the Trus tees of Georgia granted \\ncertain groups of religious refugees a general exemption from the laws that allowed them \\u201cto organize themselves in accordance with their own \\nfaith.\\u201d Id., at 1471. One historia n described one such \\ngroup from Salzburg\\u2014which formed the town of Ebenezer\\u2014as \\u201ca state within a state, a sort of \\ntheocracy under the direction of their minsters with \\ndaily conferences of the entire congregation in which \\nGod\\u2019s guidance was invoked at the beginning and the \\nend.\\u201d Id. Although these groups where required to \\nobey certain colonial laws pertaining to military service, property, and good governance, they were \\n\\u201cotherwise free to govern themselves.\\u201d Id. at 1471 \\nn.312 \\nAnother founding era example of religious \\nexemptions for expressive action appeared in North \\nCarolina and Maryland. There, laws exempted \\nmembers of certain religious sects from a \\nrequirement to remove their hat in court. Id. The \\nreligious objectors viewed such an action as \\u201ca form of obeisance to secular authority forbidden by their \\nreligion.\\u201d Id., at 1472. Rather than forcing members \\nof these sects to choose be tween access to the courts \\nor expressing themselves in violation of their religious beliefs, states offered an exemption. \\nWhile this example may seem trivial by today\\u2019s \\nstandards, it was very mu ch on the minds of the \\n 17\\nFounding Generation. At the time, \\u201c[o]ne of the most \\nnotorious courtroom cases of religious intolerance in \\nEngland involved William Penn\\u2019s refusal to remove \\nhis hat when he appeared in court\\u201d to face \\nindictment for speaking to  an unlawful assembly. Id. \\nWhen Penn refused to remove a court-furnished hat from his head in respect to the court, he was held in \\ncontempt and imprisoned. Id. This case attracted \\nsignificant attention in America, and undoubtedly influenced the exemptions passed in North Carolina and Maryland. Id. \\nIndeed, the importance of this exemption was \\ndemonstrated in debates over the Bill of Rights in \\nthe First Congress. Id., at 1472, n.320. In ridiculing \\nthe list of freedoms proposed to be protected, Theodore Sedgwick of Mass achusetts remarked \\u201cthey \\nmight have declared that a man should have a right to wear his hat if he pleased . . . but he would ask the \\ngentleman whether he thought it necessary to enter \\nthese trifles in a declaration of rights.\\u201d Id. (citation \\nomitted). With unmistakable reference to the Penn case, John Page of Virginia replied: \\nThe gentleman from \\nMassachusetts . . . objects to the clause, \\nbecause the right is of so trivial a \\nnature. He supposes it no more \\nessential than whether a man has a \\nright to wear his hat or not; but let me \\nobserve to him that such rights have \\nbeen opposed, and a man has been obliged to pull off his hat when he \\nappeared before the face of authority; \\npeople have also been prevented from \\n 18\\nassembling together on their lawful \\noccasions.  \\nId. (citation omitted). Certainly, the Founders were \\nacutely aware of the potential for abuse by \\nauthorities absent a robust religious liberty \\nprotection that clearly extended to actions, including \\nreligiously motivated expression or non-expression. \\n3. Taken together, the Free Exercise Clause and \\nthe Free Speech Clause elevate the freedom not to \\nspeak out of accordance with firmly held religious beliefs to the highest echelon of First Amendment \\nprotection. This conclusion is buttressed by the First \\nAmendment\\u2019s other guarantees\\u2014e.g., freedom of \\nassembly and freedom to petition the government. If \\nthe Free Exercise Clause conferred nothing more \\nthan a \\u201cright to express religious beliefs,\\u201d it would \\n\\u201cadd nothing to the First Amendment, since that right is fully protected by the right to assemble, \\nspeak, and publish.\\u201d Report to the Attorney General, \\nsupra note 2, at 19. Indeed, \\u201cbecause religious \\nexpression is doubly protected by the constitutional \\ntext\\u201d it would make little sense if it were \\u201cless \\nprotected in practice.\\u201d Id. , at 19, n.30. \\nThe examples cited above represent a clear \\nunderstanding by the Founding Generation that civil \\nlaws, even of general applicability, must yield when they conflict with religious expression or the freedom \\nto refrain from expression on the basis of a sincerely \\nheld religious belief. As it seems early legislative \\nbodies believed exemptions in such cases were \\nrequired by the principle of free exercise, it stands to \\nreason that the Framers understood \\u201csimilar \\napplications of the principle\\u201d would guide the courts \\n 19\\nin these cases, once \\u201centrusted with the \\nresponsibility of enforcing\\u201d First Amendment \\nguarantees. McConnell, Origins, at 1473. \\nAlthough there was a dearth of litigation over \\nreligious liberty protections in the early years of the \\nRepublic, what scarce examples exist support this \\nview. Consider, for example, the earliest state court \\nopinion addressing the issue of a religious liberty exemption, People v. Phillips . In that case, the court \\nheld that the New York Constitution protected a Catholic priest from compulsory testimony to \\nmatters learned while administering the Sacrament \\nof Confession. See  id., at 1504. \\nImportant to the Phillips court was the notion \\nthat requiring testimony from the priest to \\u201cwhat he \\nreceives in confession, is to declare that there shall \\nbe no penance; and this important branch of the Roman Catholic religion would be thus annihilated.\\u201d \\nId. (citation omitted). The court did not believe it was \\ncompatible with religious liberty to compel expression that would so eviscerate a core belief of Catholic faith. Rather than establishing a special \\nprivilege for adherents to the Catholic faith, though, \\nthe court viewed its actions as necessary to ensure \\nCatholics received the same  treatment as Protestants \\n(the dominant faith at the time) in the administration of their sacraments. Id., at 1504-05. \\nThe through line to the Founding Generation\\u2019s \\nunderstanding of religious liberty was a belief that \\nsuch freedom was without substantive meaning if it did not encompass expression, and non-expression, \\nrooted in religious belief. Noted Nineteenth Century \\n 20\\nConstitutional commentator, Michigan Supreme \\nCourt Justice Thomas Cooley, explained: \\nAn earnest believer usually regards it as his duty to propagate his opinions, \\nand to bring others to his views. To \\ndeprive him of this right is to take from \\nhim the power to perform what he \\nconsiders a most sacred obligation.  \\nT. Cooley, A Treatise on the Constitutional \\nLimitations 665 (7th ed. 1903). Put another way: \\nreligious freedom, as understood by the Founders, \\nnecessarily encompasses the freedom to put belief \\ninto action, to engage in expression consistent with \\nthe dogmas of your faith, and to refrain from \\nexpression that may engender extratemporal consequences. \\nII. T\\nHIS COURT \\u2019S PRECEDENTS \\u2014ESPECIALLY ITS \\nDEMANDING APPLICATION OF THE LEAST -\\nRESTRICTIVE MEANS TEST \\u2014DEMONSTRATE \\nAGREEMENT WITH THE FOUNDING GENERATION \\u2019S \\nROBUST RELIGIOUS LIBERTY PROTECTIONS . \\nThis Court has a commendable history of \\nrecognizing the principles discussed above. In \\nparticular, the Court\\u2019s recent religious liberty \\njurisprudence has been a welcome reprieve for \\nmembers of all faith communities who have been disheartened by the antagonism of some government \\nactors. See,  e.g., Espinoza v. Mont. Dept of Revenue , \\n140 S. Ct. 2246 (2020); Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. \\nColo. Civil Rights Comm\\u2019n , 138 S. Ct. 1719 (2018); \\nHosanna-Tabor , 565 U.S. 171. \\n 21\\nOf particular note is the Court\\u2019s insistence on a \\nforceful application of the strict scrutiny test to any \\nrestriction that burdens religious liberty. Indeed, \\u201cin \\nthis highly sensitive constitutional area, \\u2018only the \\ngravest abuses, endangering paramount interests, \\ngive occasion for permissible limitation.\\u2019\\u201d Sherbert v. \\nVerner , 374 U.S. 398, 406 (1963) (quoting Thomas v. \\nCollins, 323 U.S. 516, 530 (1945)). \\n1. A few examples illustrate the point. Consider \\nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. , where this \\nCourt considered a government-imposed contraceptive mandate on private employers who \\nbelieved such a requirement to be against their \\nreligious beliefs. 573 U.S. 682, 726 (2014).\\n4 While \\nassuming, without deciding, that the government\\u2019s \\ninterest was compelling, the Court nonetheless found \\nthat the least-restrictive-means standard was not \\nmet. Id., at 728. Identifying alternative solutions to \\nthe rigid mandate imposed by the government, the Court explained, \\u201c[t]he least-restrictive-means \\nstandard is exceptionally demanding.\\u201d Id.  As Justice \\nKennedy explained, religious freedom \\u201cimplicates more than just freedom of belief\\u201d; rather \\u201c[i]t means, too, the right to express those beliefs and to establish \\none\\u2019s religious (or nonreligious) self-definition in the \\npolitical, civic, and econ omic life of our larger \\n                                           \\n4 Hobby Lobby  was decided under the Religious Freedom \\nRestoration Act of 1993 (\\u201cRFRA\\u201d), which requires as an initial \\nmatter finding a substantial government burden on the exercise of religion; if such a burden exists, the Court must determine \\nwhether there is a compelling governmental interest and that \\nthe burden is the least restrictive means of furthering that \\ninterest. Hobby Lobby , 573 U.S., at 694-95. \\n 22\\ncommunity.\\u201d Id., at 736\\u201337 (Kennedy, J., \\nconcurring). \\nIn another instance, this Court found Missouri \\nviolated a church\\u2019s religious  liberty guarantees under \\nthe First Amendment when it categorically denied \\ntheir participation in a grant program for playground \\nsurface materials. Trinity Lutheran Church of \\nColumbia, Inc. v. Comer , 137 S. Ct. 2012, 2017, 2025 \\n(2017). Finding that otherwise eligible grant \\nrecipients were disqualified solely because of their \\nreligious nature, this Court held that such a penalty \\nworked against the free exercise of religion and \\u201ctriggers the most exacting scrutiny.\\u201d Id., at 2021. \\nImportantly, the harm was not the denial of the grant itself but instead was Missouri\\u2019s refusal to \\neven allow the church to compete with secular \\norganizations for grant funds solely on the basis of \\nits religious identity. Id., at 2022. \\nMore recently still, this Court took up the mantle \\nof religious liberties in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia . \\nDespite the Catholic Church\\u2019s over two centuries of dedication to serving the needy children of \\nPhiladelphia, the City in 2018 stopped referring foster children to the Catholic Social Services (\\u201cCSS\\u201d) \\nafter learning the organization would not \\u201cconsider \\nprospective foster parents in same-sex marriages.\\u201d \\nFulton , 141 S. Ct., at 1874\\u201375. Finding that \\u201cit is \\nplain\\u201d the City burdens CSS\\u2019s \\u201creligious exercise by putting it to the choice of  curtailing its mission or \\napproving relationships inconsistent with its beliefs,\\u201d this Court sought a review of whether such burden \\nwas \\u201cconstitutionally permissible.\\u201d Id., at 1876. In \\ndetermining that Philadelphia imposed an unconstitutional burden on CSS\\u2019s religious exercise, \\n 23\\nFulton  admonishes that \\u201cso lo ng as the government \\ncan achieve its interests in a manner that does not \\nburden religion, it must do so.\\u201d Id., at 1881. \\nTaken together, the precedents of this Court \\nestablish that an exacting analysis is required in \\nreligious liberty cases to determine whether the \\ngovernment\\u2019s interest is compelling, and its burden \\nnarrowly tailored to achieve that interest. The \\nexistence of an alternative means for achieving even \\na compelling interest is nearly always fatal to the government\\u2019s argument.  \\n2. When religious liberty and free expression \\nconcerns intertwine, this Court has been even less \\nhesitant to invalidate an infringing law. This \\nskepticism is warranted, as attempts to compel \\nexpression that conflicts with an individual\\u2019s \\nreligious beliefs are nothing more than indirect \\nattempts to regulate religion itself. \\nIn 1943, this Court took issue with a West \\nVirginia law mandating a flag salute and pledge, when its application was challenged by a group of \\nJehovah\\u2019s Witnesses who said such action violated \\ntheir religious beliefs. W. Va. State Bd. Of Educ. V. \\nBarnette , 319 U.S. 624 (1943). Refusing to find that \\n\\u201ca Bill of Rights which guards the individual\\u2019s right \\nto speak his own mind, left it open to public \\nauthorities to compel him to utter what is not on his \\nmind,\\u201d the Barnette  Court blocked the law\\u2019s \\nenforcement. Id. , at 634; see also  id., at 645 (Murphy, \\nJ., concurring) (recognizing \\u201c[t]he right of freedom of thought and of religion as guaranteed by the \\nConstitution against State action includes both the \\nright to speak freely and the right to refrain from \\n 24\\nspeaking at all\\u201d). Underlying the Court\\u2019s opinion was \\nthe belief that \\u201c[i]f there is any fixed star in our \\nconstitutional constellation, it is that no official, high \\nor petty, can prescribe what  shall be orthodox in \\npolitics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act \\ntheir faith therein.\\u201d Id., at 642. \\nExpanding on the holding in Barnette , the Court \\nin Wooley v. Maynard  considered a religious \\nobjection to display of the New Hampshire state motto\\u2014\\u201cLive Free or Die\\u201d\\u2014on the license plate of a \\ncar owned by Jehovah\\u2019s Witness. 430 U.S. 705 (1977). In Wooley , the Court expressly rejected the \\nidea that \\u201cthe State may constitutionally require an individual to participate in the dissemination of an \\nideological message by displaying it on his private \\nproperty.\\u201d Id., at 713. \\nFoundational to its decision was the Court\\u2019s \\nholding that the freedoms contained within the First \\nAmendment \\u201cincludes both the right to speak freely \\nand the right to refrain from speaking at all.\\u201d Id., at \\n714. It matters not whether most agree with the message the State seeks to force a person to convey; the First Amendment unquestionably \\u201cprotects the \\nright of individuals to hold a point of view different \\nfrom the majority and to refu se to foster . . . an idea \\nthey find morally objectionable.\\u201d Id. , at 715. Finding \\nthe existence of a governmental burden, the Court \\nwas left to question whether a substantial \\ngovernmental interest existed and, if so, whether the \\nburden was narrowly tailored to advance that \\ninterest. Even assuming a legitimate and substantial interest, the Court concluded \\u201cthat purpose cannot \\nbe pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental \\n 25\\npersonal liberties when the end can be more \\nnarrowly achieved.\\u201d Id., at 716. New Hampshire \\nfailed that test. \\nIn still another line of cases, this Court found \\nthat it violated Constitutional protections to subject religious observants, who went door to door \\ndistributing religious materials and soliciting for the \\npurchase of religious books, to a government \\nsolicitation registration requirement. Murdock v. \\nPennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105 (1943); see also Follett v. \\nTown of McCormick , 321 U.S. 573 (1944). \\nAcknowledging that the practice was derived from the believer\\u2019s understanding that he was \\u201cobeying a \\ncommandment of God,\\u201d the Court found that the First Amendment prohibited the imposition of a \\ngenerally applicable registration requirement to \\nengage in such conduct. Murdock , 319 U.S., at 108, \\n117. Indeed, the Court went out of its way to describe the literature being distributed as \\u201cprovocative, \\nabusive, and ill-mannered.\\u201d Id., at 115\\u201316. \\nNevertheless, \\u201c[p]lainly  a community may not \\nsuppress . . . the dissemination of views because they \\nare unpopular, annoying or distasteful.\\u201d Id.,  at 116 \\nTo allow otherwise would \\u201cbe a complete repudiation of the philosophy of the Bill of Rights.\\u201d Id. \\nThe Court went further still , establishing that the \\nmere fact the religious materials were being \\u201csold\\u201d was not enough to transform \\u201cevangelism into a \\ncommercial enterprise.\\u201d Id., at 111. As such, the \\nCourt acknowledged heightened constitutional protections for \\u201cthose spreading their religious \\nbeliefs through the spoken and printed word.\\u201d Id. As \\ncompared to purely commercial activity, \\u201c[f]reedom of \\n 26\\npress, freedom of speech, fr eedom of religion are in a \\npreferred position.\\u201d Id., at 115. \\nEven Employment Division v. Smith , often \\ncriticized as having watered down constitutional \\nreligious liberty protections, recognized the Court\\u2019s \\nunique hostility toward burdens that implicate both \\nthe free exercise of religion and the freedom of \\nspeech. The \\u201cFirst Amendment bars application of a \\nneutral, generally applicable law to religiously \\nmotivated action\\u201d when that action \\u201cinvolve[s] not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but the Free \\nExercise Clause in conjunction with other \\nconstitutional protections, such as freedom of \\nspeech.\\u201d Empl. Div. v. Smith , 494 U.S. 872, 881\\u201382 \\n(1990). Even some preceden ts, decided on free speech \\ngrounds alone, were undoubtedly reinforced by \\ntouches of freedom-of-religion concerns. Id. \\n3. This much is clear: the arc of this Court\\u2019s \\nprecedent bends in one incontrovertible direction. \\nScrutiny of any government burden is at its zenith \\nwhen the burden effects an individual\\u2019s exercise of their religious beliefs in a manner that implicates \\nfree speech protections. This conclusion, rooted in the \\nhistory and tradition of religious exercise as \\nunderstood by the Founders and enshrined in the \\nFirst Amendment, demands that any such burden be \\nsubjected to the most rigorous application of strict \\nscrutiny analysis. \\nIt is precisely for this reason that, to the best of \\nAmicus Curiae\\u2019s knowledge, the Court has never \\nissued an opinion finding that governmentally \\ncompelled religious speech satisfies strict scrutiny. \\nSee 303 Creative Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Elenis , 6 F.4th \\n 27\\n1160, 1191 (U.S. 10th Cir. 2021) (Tymkovich, C.J., \\ndissenting) (\\u201c[T]he majority takes the remarkable\\u2014\\nand novel\\u2014stance that the government may force \\nMs. Smith to produce messages that violate her \\nconscience. . . . No case has ever gone so far.\\u201d). \\nThis case should not be the first. \\nIII. THE TENTH CIRCUIT \\u2019S OPINION CANNOT BE \\nSQUARED EITHER WITH THE FIRST \\nAMENDMENT \\u2019S RICH HISTORY OR THIS COURT \\u2019S \\nPROTECTION OF BELIEVERS \\u2019 FREE SPEECH \\nRIGHTS . \\nIn its permissive application of strict scrutiny, the \\nTenth Circuit bastardized this Court\\u2019s protection of free speech rights, especially as applied to religious \\nexpression. If allowed to stand, its precedent will give license to courts across this Country to \\nhumiliate members of all religious sects by \\ncompelling them to speak in contravention of their \\nsincerely held religious beliefs. By purporting to \\napply strict scrutiny, the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s opinion \\ncheapened the First Amendment rights of Catholics, \\nProtestants, Muslims, Jews, and all other believers alike. \\nLuckily, this precedent d oes not need to stand. \\nThis Court, once again, has an opportunity to \\nadmonish that the free speech protections of \\nbelievers are no less than non-believers and, in fact, \\nare heightened when faced with government \\nregulation that would compel speech antithetical to the tenants of a believer\\u2019s faith. The First \\nAmendment commands such a result. \\n 28\\nAlthough the Tenth Circuit rightly concluded that \\nMs. Smith\\u2019s website designs are \\u201cpure speech,\\u201d 303 \\nCreative LLC, 6 F.4th, at 1176, the Tenth Circuit \\nwrongly concludes that the commercial nature of Ms. \\nSmith\\u2019s speech gives Colorado a regulatory hook to \\nlatch onto. Id., at 1179. By failing to acknowledge the \\nreligious nature of her objection to the would-be compelled speech, the Tenth Circuit did not afford \\nher First Amendment rights the \\u201cpreferred\\u201d status \\nthey deserve.\\n5 Cf., Murdock , 319 U.S., at 115. What \\nis remarkable is that the religious nature of Ms. Smith\\u2019s objection is not disputed. See 303 \\nCreative, 6 F. 4th, at 1172 (Ms. Smith is \\u201cwilling to create custom graphics and websites for gay, lesbian, \\nor bisexual clients . . . so long as the custom graphics \\nand websites do not violate [her] religious beliefs, as is true for all customers.\\u201d (internal quotation marks \\nomitted)); id., at 1192 (Tymkovich, C.J., dissenting) \\n(\\u201cIn short, Colorado appear s to agree that Ms. Smith \\ndoes not distinguish between customers based on \\nprotected-class status and thus advances the aims of \\nCADA. But when any customer asks Ms. Smith to \\ncreate expressive content that violates her sincerely \\nheld beliefs, she will decline the request.\\u201d). \\n                                           \\n5 Remarkably, the Tenth Circuit  suggests that its sweeping \\nholding may not apply to \\u201call artists\\u201d if they were not engaged \\nin \\u201ccommercial activity,\\u201d but rather \\u201ccommissioning a mural for some charitable purpose.\\u201d 303 Creative , 6 F.4th, at 1182, n.6. To \\nsuggest that a local artist wh o refuses to paint a Christian \\nmural for a church may enjoy more constitutional protections \\nthan a woman called to live out her sincerely held religious \\nbeliefs by creating custom wedding websites is, thankfully, not supported by the history or tradition of the First Amendment \\nand the muscular protections it affords religious believers. \\n 29\\nThis failure is compounded by the Tenth Circuit\\u2019s \\nfallacy of a marketplace of one for Ms. Smith\\u2019s \\nspeech. Id. at 1180. Such convenient analysis \\nallowed the court to conclude \\u201cthere are no less intrusive means of providing equal access to those  \\ntypes of services.\\u201d Id. (emphasis added). But this \\nclever reasoning flips this Court\\u2019s precedent on its \\nhead. Rather than prioritize the religious speaker\\u2019s \\nobjection in search of a less restrictive means, the \\ncourt below merely concluded that she is the only one and therefore no other means will suffice. But, \\nwhere, as here, the government can achieve its interests without burdening religion, the \\nConstitution requires it to do so. Fulton , 141 S. Ct., \\nat 1881. The analysis is also anomalous in the free speech context because it cannot be that the more \\nunique and distinctive the speech, the less  First \\nAmendment protection it deserves. But that is the staggering breadth of the Tenth Circuit majority\\u2019s \\nconclusion. See 303 Creative , 6 F.4th, at 1204-05 \\n(Tymkovich, C.J., dissenting).  \\nMoreover, by categorizing Ms. Smith as nothing \\nmore than a \\u201cpublic accommodation,\\u201d the Tenth \\nCircuit minimized her right to participate in the \\nmarketplace, even as a woman of faith. See 303 \\nCreative, 6 F.4th, at 1181 (\\u201c[W]hether an exception limits market access depends upon the uniqueness of \\nthe public accommodation\\u2019s goods and services\\u2014not \\nthe sincerity of the public accommodation\\u2019s beliefs.\\u201d). \\nTo deny a benefit to those \\u201cwho engage in certain \\nforms of speech is in effect to penalize them for such \\nspeech,\\u201d and constitutionally, no different than \\nconditioning a benefit on a person\\u2019s \\u201cwillingness to \\nviolate a cardinal principle of her religious faith;\\u201d the \\n 30\\nresult is the same: to \\u201cdeter[] or discourage[] the \\nexercise of First Amendment rights of expression.\\u201d \\nSherbert , 374 U.S., at 405-06 (citing Speiser v. \\nRandall, 357 U.S. 513, 518 (1958)). Here too, Colorado seeks to impose the same constitutional \\nharm: speak in violation of your core religious faith \\nor lose the benefit of marketplace participation. Put \\nsimply, Colorado seeks to punish Ms. Smith for her \\nsincerely held religious beliefs. See also Trinity \\nLutheran Church , 137 S. Ct., at 2021\\u201322 (finding a \\nconstitutional violation where a burden puts \\nreligious believers \\u201cto a choice: [] participate in an \\notherwise available benefit\\u201d or maintain your \\nreligious identity). \\nThe same fundamental principle must apply to \\nfree speech and religious practices when they act in concert: \\u201cIn an open, pluralistic, self-governing \\nsociety, the expression of an idea cannot be \\nsuppressed simply because some find it offensive, \\ninsulting, or even wounding.\\u201d Fulton , 141 S. Ct., at \\n1924-25 (Alito, J., concurring). To lose this principle is to lose the \\u201cpreservation of religious freedom.\\u201d Id., \\nat 1925. That is because \\u201c[s]uppressing speech\\u2014or \\nreligious practice\\u2014simply because it expresses an idea that some find hurtful is a zero-sum game.\\u201d Id. \\nThis Court\\u2019s jurisprudence confirms this link \\nbetween religious exercise and free speech because \\nthis Court\\u2019s opinions \\u201cmake it perfectly clear that \\ndiscrimination against religious, as opposed to \\nsecular, expression is viewpoint discrimination.\\u201d \\nNurre v. Whitehead , 559 U.S. 1025, 1028 (2010) \\n(Alito, J., dissenting). And because viewpoint discrimination is \\u201can egregious form of content \\ndiscrimination,\\u201d Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of \\n 31\\nthe Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995), it brings \\nwith it heightened constitutional skepticism. \\nAlthough some may find Ms. Smith\\u2019s religious \\nbeliefs objectionable, \\u201creligions, and those who \\nadhere to religious doctrines, may continue to \\nadvocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by \\ndivine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be \\ncondoned.\\u201d Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U.S. 644, 679 \\n(2015). \\u201cAn open society can keep that promise while still respecting the \\u2018dignity,\\u2019 \\u2018worth,\\u2019 and fundamental equality of all members of the \\ncommunity.\\u201d Fulton , 141 S. Ct., at 1925 (Alito, J., \\nconcurring) (quoting Masterpiece Cakeshop , 138 S. \\nCt., at 1727). Ms. Smith should be free to practice all \\naspects of her faith, without fear of government-\\ncompelled expression against her sincerely held \\nreligious beliefs. The Constitution demands no less. \\nCONCLUSION \\n \\n\\u201c[T]here is before us the right of freedom to \\nbelieve, freedom to worship one\\u2019s Maker according to the dictates of one\\u2019s conscience, a right which the \\nConstitution specifically shelters.\\u201d Barnette , 319 \\nU.S., at 645 (Murphy, J., concurring). For this Court, there is \\u201cno loftier duty or responsibility than to \\nuphold that spiritual freedom to its farthest \\nreaches.\\u201d Id. \\nTo exclude Ms. Smith from offering her services\\u2014\\nsolely on the basis of her religious identity\\u2014would be \\n\\u201codious to our Constitution.\\u201d Trinity Lutheran \\nChurch , 137 S.

As part of that project, EPA has obtained emails and handwritten and typewritten notes under public records requests, which records on their face confess to the driving factor behind this liti-gation and similar litigation and inform the inquiry into federal versus state jurisdiction in this booming class of \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation filed in state courts. These records EPA obtained prompted it to file its first amicus  brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for \\nthe First Circuit, where removal of another among the growing number of \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d lawsuits filed \\nby governmental entities seeking billions of dollars \\nfrom private parties is pending.\\n2 That brief revealed \\ntwo sets of notes each purporting, independently, to record the assertion by an official with the governmen-tal plaintiff in that case, the State of Rhode Island, that the litigation seeks to obtain a \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d to underwrite that State\\u2019s spending ambitions, \\n \\n 1 Pursuant to Rule 37.6, counsel for Amicus  certifies that no \\ncounsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in part and that no person or entity other than Amici  or their counsel made a \\nmonetary contribution intended to fund the brief \\u2019s preparation or submission.

Leave for EPA to file as amicus \\ncuriae  granted on March 26, 2020 \\n2 \\n after the State\\u2019s legislature declined to provide the de-\\nsired funds. Rhode Island\\u2019s confession was made at a meeting attended by \\u201ccabinet\\u201d-level representatives of numerous state governments from across the nation, including a representative from Maryland, and empha-sized the desire to pr oceed in state courts.\\n3 In that First \\nCircuit litigation, numerous  parties rely upon the \\nFourth Circuit\\u2019s decision in  the instant matter, and par-\\nties to the First Circuit litigation ad dressed the Fourth \\nCircuit\\u2019s opinion below in let ters of supplemental au-\\nthority pursuant to Fed.

Because EPA \\nhas obtained records confe ssing the rationale behind \\nthe veritable tsunami of state-court \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d lawsuits such as the one now before this Court, and af-firming the plaintiffs\\u2019 emp hasis among peers and other \\npotential governmental plaint iff-recruits on using state \\ncourts for these actions with  national p olicy implica-\\ntions and avoiding the federal court system, EPA is keenly interested in this case and asks this Court to \\ngrant certiorari to address th e proper relationship be-\\ntween the state and federal court systems. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\n As important as climate policy is to both state and \\nfederal governments, equally and arguably more im-portant is the principle that the courts\\u2019 role is not to \\nmake policy judgments. This Court held in American \\nElectric Power v. Connecticut , 131 S. Ct. 2527, 2539, \\n \\n 3 A full list of attendees prepared by the organizers and ob-\\ntained under Colorado law is ava ilable at https://govoversight.org/ \\nwp-content/uploads/2020/01/Fulsome-list-of-participants.png. \\n3 \\n 564 U.S. 410, 426 (2011) that \\u201cthe federal courts would \\nhave no warrant to employ the federal common law of nuisance to upset\\u201d federal primacy in climate regula-tory policy. But rather than heed the American Electric \\nPower  opinion\\u2019s warnings that federal policy decisions \\nare to be made by Congress or by federal agencies ex-ercising properly delegated authority, certain litigants have instead attempted to end run that holding by seeking to create policy in state, rather than federal, courts. While federal courts ar e courts of limited juris-\\ndiction, in this matter the de cision below is based upon \\na series of cases that have eviscerated the jurisdiction of federal courts, even when important federal inter-ests are at stake. This is in conflict with the decisions of other Circuits, congressional action taken since these \\nFourth Circuit precedents were  adopted, and this Court\\u2019s \\nown rulings. Allowing the opin ion below to stand will \\ncause mischief in state courts across the nation. Re-cently obtained public records provide strong impetus to acknowledge, as a formal matter, that this \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation campaign is an impermissible use of the state courts, just as this Court previously held it \\nwas an impermissible use of the federal courts. This Court should prevent litigants from seeking the most favorable forum to obtain p olitical and policy ends by \\njudicial means. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\n  \\n4 \\n ARGUMENT \\nI. THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\\u2019S DECISION CON-\\nTRADICTS RECENT JURISPRUDENCE \\nAND LEGISLATION. THIS COURT SHOULD \\nGRANT CERTIORARI TO ENFORCE ITS OWN PRECEDENTS AND CONGRESSIONAL INTENT \\n The decision below, designated for publication and \\nwith the potential to shape or confuse the law for years \\nto come, is based on a series of precedents unique to the Fourth Circuit, many of which contradict more re-\\ncent holdings of this Court and even statutory changes \\nenacted by Congress. The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s reliance on its own, idiosyncratic precedents led to a result that is \\nin conflict with the holdings  of numerous other courts \\nand which will, if allowed to stand, result in mischief across the nation. \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision below, while pub-\\nlished only this year, has its foundations in a holding \\nfrom the 1970s that has been  adrift in changing legal \\nseas since then, and was implicitly swamped by a hold-ing of this Court twenty years ago. That Fourth Circuit \\nopinion, Noel v. McCain , 538 F.2d 633 (4th Cir. 1976), \\nheld that remand orders are essentially unreviewable unless they raise very narrow statutory grounds. Stare \\ndecisis  is an important legal principle, but in this case \\nthe Fourth Circuit\\u2019s adherence to its own precedents rather than those of this Court was misplaced. \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision below acknowledges \\nthat this Court subsequently interpreted the same \\n5 \\n statutory language differently in Yamaha Motor Corp., \\nU.S.A. v. Calhoun , 516 U.S. 199 (1996). More recently, \\nthe Seventh Circuit reached a contrary conclusion \\nabout the reviewability of di strict court orders to re-\\nmand in Lu Junhong v. Boeing Co. , 792 F.3d 805, 810\\u2013\\n13 (7th Cir. 2015). Even assuming, arguendo , that the \\nFourth Circuit properly decided the Noel  case in 1976, \\ncontinued reliance on Noel  is no longer appropriate. \\n It isn\\u2019t just precedent t hat has changed since the \\nFourth Circuit issued its opinion in Noel . Relevant \\nstatutory law has also changed: the Removal Clarifica-\\ntion Act of 2011, Pub. L. No. 112-51, 125 Stat. 545, clar-ified Congressional intent for federal courts to \\u201cclarify \\nand improve certain provisions relating to the removal \\nof litigation against Federal officers or agencies to Fed-\\neral courts.\\u201d \\n The Fourth Circuit\\u2019s decision below (hereinafter \\n\\u201cBaltimore \\u201d), is based on foundations that Congress, \\nother federal courts, and this Court have steadily \\neroded since the Fourth Circu it issued the authority on \\nwhich Baltimore  rests. This Court, the Seventh Circuit, \\nand Congress itself have all spoken more recently. The \\ninnovative legal theories brought by the Plaintiffs in this case further highlight the need to decide the mat-\\nter based on current law. This Court should take the \\nopportunity to apply the Removal Clarification Act and resolve the split in the circuits that the Baltimore  opin-\\nion below aggravates. \\n \\n6 \\n II. IF THE DECISION BELOW STANDS, FED-\\nERAL COURTS WILL BE UNABLE TO PRE-\\nVENT FEDERAL POLICIES FROM BEING UNDERMINED AT THE STATE LEVEL \\n This suit is but one of many similar suits being \\nfiled all over the country. More than a dozen U.S. cit-\\nies, states and counties including the State of Rhode Island, City and County of Boulder (CO), City and \\nCounty of Honolulu (HI), City of New York (NY), \\nMarin, San Mateo and Santa Cruz Counties (CA), the cities of Imperial Beach, Oakland, Richmond, San \\nFrancisco, San Mateo, and Santa Cruz (CA), and King \\nCounty (WA), among others have filed similar claims against similar and generally the same defendants al-\\nleging similar causes of action which allegedly arise \\nunder state law. As at least one court has previously noted, multi-front litigation raises important concerns \\nabout the motivations of litigants. Chevron Corp. v. \\nDonziger , 974 F.Supp.2d 362, 475 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (\\u201cThe \\npoint of the multi-front strategy thus was to leverage \\nthe expense, risks, and bu rden to [defendant] of de-\\nfending itself in multiple jurisdictions to achieve a swift recovery, most likely by precipitating a settle-\\nment.\\u201d), later upheld at Chevron Corp. v. Donziger , 833 \\nF.3d 74 (2d Cir. 2016), cert. denied  at 137 S. Ct. 2268 \\n(2017). \\n This explosion in such cases filed in state court \\nseeks many hundreds of billions of dollars from private \\nparties, and seeks to enlist the defendants as advo-\\ncates in pressing for the plai ntiffs\\u2019 and their partners\\u2019 \\ndesired federal policies. Records obtained by Amicus  \\n7 \\n also show the attempt to us e the litigation to obtain \\ngovernmental revenues after that failed through the \\nappropriate, political process (see, infra ). Affirming the \\nimpropriety of this use of the courts as well as the ar-dent campaign by state and municipal plaintiffs to \\nkeep the matters away from the federal court and ex-\\nclusively before state courts, EPA has obtained emails and handwritten and typewritten notes under public \\nrecords requests, further discussed below, that illus-\\ntrate the danger of allowing st ate courts to interfere in \\nthis way in lawful interstate commerce conducted un-\\nder the auspices of the federal government. Key among \\nthese public records are two sets of notes each purport-ing, independently, to record the assertion by a senior \\nState of Rhode Island official that the objective of its \\nlitigation was to obtain a \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d for the State\\u2019s spending ambitions, in the face of a leg-\\nislature that does not share the executive\\u2019s priorities. \\n Both sets of notes record that official as emphasiz-\\ning the use of state courts to  obtain this funding denied \\nthem by the legislature. Other records, also noted, in-\\nfra, record the plaintiff \\u2019s legal counsel\\u2019s team, at least \\nsome of whom also represent the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore in this litigation,\\n4 lobbying gov-\\nernmental officials to join the campaign emphasizing the strategy of advancing this cause in the \\u201cmore ad-vantageous venue for these cases,\\u201d which plaintiffs confess is to be had in state courts. \\n \\n 4 The California law firm Sher Edling LLP represents both \\nthe State of Rhode Island in the First Circuit and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore in the Fourth Circuit. \\n8 \\n  These public records obtained through state open \\nrecords laws by Amicus  EPA represent a Rhode Island \\n\\u201ccabinet\\u201d-level official confiding to peers that the \\nState\\u2019s elected representatives are insufficiently moved by the plaintiff \\u2019s requests to enact laws raising \\nthe revenues the State\\u2019s executive desires; and that it \\nis thus \\u201clooking for [a] sustainable funding stream,\\u201d having been reduced to \\u201csuing big oil\\u201d for its \\u201cPriority \\n\\u2013 sustainable funding stream .\\u201d Notably, both sets of \\nnotes capture the State of Rhode Island as having em-phasized the \\u201cstate court\\u201d aspect of its plan. \\n These records, representing a similarly-situated \\nplaintiff \\u2019s confession, as recorded identically by two by \\nothers in the comfort of a presumably candid and off-\\nthe-record private meeting with peers and funders of \\u201cclimate\\u201d activism, leave little doubt that this growing \\nwave of state court \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation seeks \\nat least two impermissible objectives. First, this type of litigation seeks to use (state) courts to effectively \\ncreate federal energy and environmental policy. Sec-\\nond, in addition to using litigation as a stand-in for \\nthe political process that has denied state and munic-\\nipal plaintiffs their desired policies, it seeks to use lit-\\nigation to raise revenues having be en denied them \\nwhere revenues would properly be raised, which \\nagain is by the po litical process. \\n These public records provide strong impetus to \\nacknowledge, as a formal matter, that this \\u201cclimate \\nnuisance\\u201d litigation campaign is an impermissible use of the courts, seeking the most favorable forum to ob-\\ntain political ends by judicial means; that when filed \\n9 \\n they must remain in federal court; and that they \\nshould be dismissed for the same reasons. \\n \\nIII. PUBLIC RECORDS OBTAINED BY PRO-\\nPOSED AMICUS CURIAE  AFFIRM THIS \\nCASE BELONGS IN FEDERAL COURT \\n Amicus  EPA has obtained public records from Col-\\norado State University\\u2019s Center for a New Energy Economy (\\u201cCNEE\\u201d) under the Colorado Open Records \\nAct (\\u201cCORA\\u201d). Those records have now been brought to \\nthe attention of the First Circuit in related litigation, and are proper subject for judic ial notice by this Court. \\nSee Fed. Rule Evid. 201(b)(2). The records pertain to a \\ntwo-day meeting in July 2019 hosted by the Rockefel-ler Brothers Fund (\\u201cRBF\\u201d) at the Rockefeller family \\nmansion at Pocantico, NY. They include numerous \\nemails, agendas and other materials. Most pertinent, they also include a set of handwritten notes and a sec-\\nond, corroborating set of typewritten notes. According \\nto the public records themselves, the former was pre-pared by attendee Carla Frisch of the Rocky Mountain \\nInstitute (\\u201cRMI\\u201d), and the latter by attendee Katie \\nMcCormack of the Energy Foundation.\\n5 \\n \\n 5 These are available, respectively, at https://climatelitigationwatch. \\norg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Carla-Frisch-handwritten-notes- EPA_CORA1505.pdf and https:// climatelitigationwatch.org/ \\nwp-content/uploads/2020/03/EF-Katie-McCormack-typed-notes-EPA_CORA1542.pdf. These documents are identified in an August \\n20, 2019 email from CNEE\\u2019s Patric k Cummins transmitting them \\nto RBF\\u2019s Michael Northrop, Subject: meeting highlights, available at https://climatelitigationwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ \\n \\n10 \\n  This was a private event, styled \\u201cAccelerating \\nState Action on Climate Change,\\u201d if hosted as a forum \\nfor policy activists and a major funder to coordinate \\nwith senior public employees, e.g., a governor\\u2019s chief of staff and department secretaries and their cabinet \\nequivalents from fifteen states. These states included \\nFirst Circuit Plaintiff the State of Rhode Island, repre-sented by its Director of the Department of Environ-\\nmental Management, Janet Coit.\\n6 \\n These notes purport to contemporaneously record \\nthe comments of Director Coit discussing Rhode Is-\\nland\\u2019s entry in this litigation campaign, among peers. One passage in each set of no tes, attributed to Director \\nCoit and replicated almost verbatim in both, is partic-\\nularly striking and relevant, affirming two points that have become obvious and which should inform key de-\\ncisions confronting the judiciary in this \\u201cclimate nui-\\nsance\\u201d litigation campaign. \\n The records show RMI\\u2019s Frisch recorded Director \\nCoit speaking to this litigation as shown in the below \\n \\nEdited-notes-transmittal-email-CSU-suggests-Snail-mail-probably- \\ncovered-EPA_CORA1481_Redacted.pdf. \\u201cRBF CNEE climate pol-icy notes Jul 17 18.docx\\u201d are Katie McCormack\\u2019s notes (Energy Foundation); these appear to be produced as document EPA_ CORA1542.pdf, derived from Ms. McCormick\\u2019s transmittal email \\nbeing 1541, in which she describes her notes as long, and 1542 consists of 18 pages of notes;  \\u201cXerox Scan_07222019155622.pdf \\u201d \\nare Carla Frisch\\u2019s handwritten notes (this was produced as docu-ment EPA_CORA1505.pdf ). \\n \\n6 The participant list is availabl e at https://climatelitigation-\\nwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/List-of-Attendees-EPA_ CORA1037.pdf. \\n11 \\n excerpted image (Ms. Frisch\\u2019s notes are available in \\nfull at https://climatelitigationwatch.org/wp-content/ \\nuploads/2020/03/Carla-Frisch-handwritten-notes-EPA_ \\nCORA1505.pdf ). Ms. Frisch recorded Director Coit as saying, about this suit: \\nRI \\u2013 Gen Assembly D but doesn\\u2019t care on env/climate \\nlooking for sustainable funding stream \\nsuing big oil for RI damages in state court \\n \\n The first line-item attributes to Director Coit the \\nposition that the Rhode Island legislature is not per-suaded of the claims set fort h by the State in its litiga-\\ntion. This reluctance to politically impose the revenue-\\nraising measures (taxes) necessary for such funding streams is inherently shared among all \\u201cclimate nui-\\nsance\\u201d plaintiffs. The excerp t appears to also reflect \\nDirector Coit\\u2019s view of why the Rhode Island legisla-ture has thereby declined to obtain from the taxpayer, \\n\\n12 \\n and then appropriate to the State, the revenue streams \\nthat governmental Plaintiff Rhode Island desires. \\n This entry on its face represents a senior official \\nconfessing that Rhode Island\\u2019s climate litigation, es-\\nsentially identical to that in the Baltimore case below, \\nis in fact a product of Rhode Island\\u2019s elected represent-atives lacking enthusiasm for politically enacting cer-\\ntain policies, including reve nue measures, thus leaving \\nthe state \\u201clooking for [a] sustainable funding stream,\\u201d and so \\u201csuing big oil.\\u201d This characterizes all such gov-\\nernmental plaintiffs and su its including the matter \\nin the Fourth Circuit case which is the subject of the \\nPetition in this matter. \\n Fortunately, we can be confident that Ms. Frisch \\ndid not mishear Director Coit. The Energy Foundation\\u2019s \\nKatie McCormack provided RBF with a typewritten \\nset of her own notes transcribing the proceedings. To this Court\\u2019s further benefit, Ms. McCormack\\u2019s type-\\nwritten transcription of Director Coit\\u2019s commentary \\nreads almost verbatim as Ms. Frisch\\u2019s. \\n Ms. McCormack recorded Di rector Coit as saying: \\n* Assembly very conservative leadership \\u2013 don\\u2019t \\ncare about env\\u2019t \\n* If care, put it in the budget \\n* Priority \\u2013 sustainable funding stream * State court against oil/gas \\n13 \\n  \\n These notes on their face both affirm two realities \\nthat have become inescapable in recent years about this epidemic of \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation, all chan-neled into state courts (aft er the first generation of \\nsuits floundered in federal co urt, and ultimately were \\nterminated by this Court in American Electric Power v. \\nConnecticut , 131 S. Ct. 2527, 2539, 564 U.S. 410, 426 \\n(2011)).\\n7 That is that these suits seek to use the courts \\nto stand in for policymakers on two fronts. First, these suits ask the courts to substitute their authority for that of the political branches of government on matters of policy. Second, these suits seek billions of dollars in revenues, again the province of the political branches, for distribution toward political uses and constituen-cies. \\n O n  t h a t  fi r s t  c o u n t  o f  policymaking through the \\ncourts, the RBF meeting notes ratify a comment made to The Nation magazine by the plaintiffs\\u2019 tort lawyer credited with inventing this wave of litigation, Matt \\n \\n 7 See, e.g., Native Village of Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corp ., \\n663 F.Supp.2d 863 (N.D. Cal. 2009), upheld at  696 F.3d 849 (9th \\nCir. 2012). \\n\\n14 \\n Pawa. The magazine wrote, \\u201cAt the end of his speech, \\nSenator [Sheldon] Whitehouse [of Rhode Island] re-minded his colleagues of their \\u2018legislative responsibil-ity to address climate change.\\u2019 But it\\u2019s clear that too many lawmakers have abdicated, thus the pressure to tackle the climate issue thro ugh existing regulations \\nlike the Clean Air Act, and through the courts. \\u2018I\\u2019ve been hearing for twelve years or more that legislation is right around the corner that\\u2019s going to solve the global-warming problem, and that litigation is too long, difficult, and arduous a path,\\u2019 said Matthew Pawa, a climate attorney. \\u2018Legislation is going nowhere, so liti-gation could potentially play an important role.\\u2019 \\u201d\\n8 \\n Such use of the courts is of course improper but \\nalso informs a conclusion that these cases, when \\nbrought, belong in federal cour t, as well as that they \\nshould be dismissed for reasons including the inher-\\nently obvious, and now repeatedly confessed, purpose. \\n The second conclusion affirmed by these twice-\\nsourced assertions by the First Circuit plaintiffs is that \\nthis type of litigation is a grab for revenues, which again must properly be purs ued through the political \\nprocess. This is related to the first, in that, like policy, \\nsuch revenue-raising measures must be enacted by the voters\\u2019 elected representatives or approved directly by \\nvoters. Instead, with the desire for more \\u201cfunding \\nstreams\\u201d being yet another way the political process \\n \\n 8 Zoe Carpenter, The Government May Already Have the \\nLaw It Needs to Beat Big Oil , The Nation (July 15, 2015), \\nhttps://www.thenation.com/article/the-government-may-already-have-the-law-it-needs-to-beat-big-oil/. \\n15 \\n has failed such plaintiffs, we see them circumventing \\nthat process through this litigation campaign. \\n That the desire for more governmental revenue, \\nwithout adopting the necessa ry direct taxes for which \\nthere can be a political price to pay, was behind such \\nlitigation was suggested by the U.S. Chamber of Com-merce in a 2019 report enti tled \\u201cMitigating Munici-\\npality Litigation: Scope and Solutions,\\u201d published by \\nthe Chamber\\u2019s Institute fo r Legal Reform. That re-\\nport highlighted: \\n* \\u201cFor instance, local government leaders may \\neye the prospect of significant recoveries as a \\nmeans of making up for budget shortfalls.\\u201d \\n* \\u201cLarge settlements like those produced in the \\ntobacco litigation are alluring to municipali-\\nties facing budget constraints.\\u201d \\n* \\u201cSevere, persistent municipal budget con-\\nstraints have coincided with the rise of munic-ipal litigation agains t opioid manufacturers \\nas local governments are promised large re-\\ncoveries with no risk to municipal budgets by contingency fee trial lawyers.\\u201d \\n* \\u201cConclusion  A convergence of factors is propelling munici-\\npalities to file affirmative lawsuits against corporate entities. \\n There is the \\u2018push\\u2019 factor: municipalities face \\nhistoric budgetary cons traints and a public \\ninundated with news reports on the opioid cri-\\nsis, rising sea levels, and data breaches. And \\n16 \\n there is the \\u2018pull\\u2019 of potential multimillion-\\ndollar settlements and low-cost, contingency \\nfee trial lawyers. As a consequence, munici-\\npalities are pivoting to the courts by the thou-\\nsands.\\u201d9 \\n The National Association of Manufacturers\\u2019 Cen-\\nter for Legal Action has similarly argued that, \\u201cThe \\ntowns and lawyers have said that this litigation is \\nsolely about money. The towns want funding for local projects, and their lawyers are working on a contin-\\ngency fee basis, which means they aren\\u2019t paid if they \\ndon\\u2019t win.\\u201d\\n10 \\n The records EPA has obtained now provide docu-\\nmentary evidence to support these concerns that the courts are being exploited to balance municipal/state \\nbudgets and make policy decisions that legislators \\nhave declined to make. \\n \\n  \\n \\n 9 United States Chamber of Co mmerce, \\u201cMitigating Munici-\\npality Litigation: Scope and Solutions,\\u201d U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, March 2019, h ttps://www.instituteforlegalre-\\nform.com/uploads/sites/1/Mitigating-Municipality-Litigation-2019- Research.pdf, at p. 1, 6, 7 and 18, respectively. \\n \\n10 Manufacturers\\u2019 Accountability Project, \\u201cBeyond the Court-\\nroom: Climate Liability Litigation in the United States,\\u201d p. 2, https://mfgaccountabilityproject.or g/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ \\nMAP-Beyond-the-Courtroom-Chapter-One.pdf \\n17 \\n IV. HISTORIC CONCERNS ABOUT STATE \\nCOURT BIAS ARE AMPLIFIED IN CASES \\nOF THIS TYPE, SUCH THAT FEDERAL \\nCOURTS SHOULD STEP IN TO PROTECT \\nFEDERAL INTERESTS \\n A \\u201chistoric concern about state court bias\\u201d is the \\nunderlying basis allowing for federal officer removal. \\nSavoie v. Huntington Ingalls, Inc. , 817 F.3d 457, 461 \\n(5th Cir. 2016). The Supreme Court also recognizes bias as a concern justifying removal to federal court. \\n\\u201cState-court proceedings may reflect \\u2018local prejudice\\u2019 \\nagainst unpopular federal laws or federal officials.\\u201d Watson v. Philip Morris Cos. , 551 U.S. 142, 150 (2007). \\nBias exists, as these opinions acknowledge, and there \\nis no rational basis for declaring that such bias extends only to parties who are unpopular government offi-\\ncials. Indeed, this Court has  cautioned against \\u201cnarrow, \\ngrudging interpretation\\u201d of federal officer removal. Willingham v. Morgan , 395 U.S. 402, 407 (1969). \\nSimply put, \\u201c[t]he removal statute is an incident of fed-\\neral supremacy.\\u201d Murray v. Murray , 621 F.2d 103, 106 \\n(5th Cir. 1980). \\n States and municipalities are engaged in a cam-\\npaign through the courts to overturn \\u201cunpopular fed-\\neral laws.\\u201d Rather than recognizing the Constitution \\nand federal laws as supreme, governmental \\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d plaintiffs are applying \\u201cnarrow, grudging\\u201d \\ninterpretation of the removal statute to seek to over-\\nturn federal law through imposing ostensible tort lia-bility in state courts. \\n18 \\n  It is hard to imagine a more striking case where \\nfear of state court bias could be a concern than is pre-\\nsented in the instant matter and similar cases unfold-\\ning across the nation. Stated otherwise and even more affirmatively, the hope  for state court bias is demon-\\nstrably at play in these case s, as shown in other records \\nobtained by Amicus  EPA through public records laws. \\n As documented, supra , by its own admission the \\nState of Rhode Island is pursuing its litigation to ob-tain a \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d for its officials\\u2019 \\nspending ambitions, having failed to convince the vot-\\ners\\u2019 elected representatives to provide one. Rhode Is-land\\u2019s circumstance in this respect differs not at all \\nfrom all such plaintiffs including in Baltimore . Both \\nsets of notes discussed, supra , specify Director Coit\\u2019s \\nemphasis on seeking this \\u201csustainable funding stream\\u201d \\nin \\u201cstate court.\\u201d All such plaintiffs are now moving \\nHeaven and earth to keep these matters out of the clutches of federal jurisdiction. \\n This objective of suing to make federal policy in \\nstate courts is a thematic cousin of the drive to use the \\ncourts when legislatures fail to enact plaintiffs\\u2019 desired \\npolicies, and is well-understood among the instant plaintiffs, Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, and by \\nthe legal teams for most similarly-situated govern-\\nment plaintiffs. That Rhode Island and the City of Bal-timore share not only claims and legal strategies but \\nlegal counsel, whose recruit ing team has emphasized \\nto targeted governmental entities the desire to keep these matters in state court as the \\u201cmore advantageous \\nvenue for these cases,\\u201d given this Court\\u2019s ruling in \\n19 \\n American Electric Power , raises concerns that the cli-\\nmate nuisance plaintiffs also  share the hope for state \\ncourt biases in the campaign to eliminate budgetary \\nshortfalls and otherwise make policy through tort liti-gation. \\n For example, and again turning to documents ob-\\ntained through open records laws, we see that, after \\nU.S. District Judge William Alsup dismissed the City \\nof Oakland\\u2019s \\u201cclimate nuisanc e\\u201d suit against many of \\nthe same defendants in June 2018,\\n11 a lobbyist hired to \\nassist with recruiting more governmental plaintiffs for \\nSher Edling12 passed along a note of encouragement to \\n \\n 11 City of Oakland, et al. v.

G. Seth \\nPlatt is one of the network\\u2019s cons ultants, engaged to help lobby \\nFlorida municipalities to file suit similar to the State\\u2019s.

Platt worked with IGSD and others  pitching municipalities to file \\n\\u201cclimate nuisance\\u201d litigation against energy interests, with First Circuit and Fourth Circuit plaintiffs\\u2019 counsel Sher Edling. \\n On July 27, 2018 Fort Lauderdale Interim City Attorney \\nAlain Boileau wrote Mayor Dean Trantalis, copying other aides, in pertinent part: \\n\\u201cMayor . . .

(\\u201cLDF\\u201d) has strived to secure \\nthe constitutional promise of equality for all people. Petitioner asks the Court to reconsider an important question about the Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s reach, which, more than any other constitutional provision, \\nembodies our Nation\\u2019s commitment to equal justice \\nunder the law.  \\nLDF has been at the forefront of efforts to enforce \\nthe Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s promise of equality. See, e.g. , Cooper v. Aaron , 358 U.S. 1 (1958);\\n Brown v. \\nBd. of Educ. of Topeka , 347 U.S. 483 (1954) . LDF has \\nalso led the fight of eradicating discrimination from jury verdicts. See, e.g. , Ham v. South Carolina , 409 \\nU.S. 524 (1973)\\n; Alexander v. Louisiana , 405 U.S. 625 \\n(1972) ; Swain v. Alabama , 380 U.S. 202 (1965). \\nLDF submits this brief to aid the Court in \\ndeciding whether the Fourteenth Amendment\\u2019s Due Process Clause incorporates the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement against the States.\\n1  \\n  \\n                                                \\n1 Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.6, counsel for amicus \\ncuriae state that no counsel for a party authored this brief in \\nwhole or in part and that no person other than amicus curiae , its \\nmembers, or its counsel made a monetary contribution to the preparation or submission of this brief. All parties have consented to the filing of this brief. \\n2 \\n \\n SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \\nAfter the Civil War, Congress passed the \\nFourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of \\n1875 to protect the rights of newly freed African \\nAmericans. One of the rights protected by those provisions was the right to  serve on a jury. Indeed, \\nthis Court affirmed the centrality of jury service to the citizenship of African Americans 140 years ago. See \\nStrauder v. West Virginia , 100 U.S. 303 (1879). \\nThen, in 1898, white Louisianans convened a \\nconstitutional convention. Their goal was to craft a constitution that would \\u201cestablish the supremacy of \\nthe white race . . . to the extent to which it could be \\nlegally and constitutionally done . . . .\\u201d Louisiana \\nratified its non-unanimous jury provision at this convention to help achieve its goal of cementing white supremacy. While federal law made it illegal to exclude Black people from jury service, the delegates \\npassed the non-unanimous jury provision to nullify \\nthe votes of Black jurors and allow white jurors to more easily convict Black defendants. \\nLouisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury provision \\nworked exactly as intended. Up until 2018, when \\nLouisianans voted to remove the non-unanimous jury \\nprovision from their constitution, Black defendants were more likely to be convicted by non-unanimous juries than white defendants, and Black jurors were more likely than white jurors to be in the dissent. \\nThus, despite jury service being a hallmark of \\nAmerican citizenship, for ov er a century, Louisiana\\u2019s \\n3 \\n \\n non-unanimous jury provision effectively undermined \\nBlack participation on juries. \\nLouisiana has been permitted to thwart the \\nintent of the Reconstruction Congress in this manner because of this Court\\u2019s decision in Apodaca v. Oregon , \\n406 U.S. 404 (1972), in which Justice Powell\\u2019s idiosyncratic view that the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement does not apply to the States \\nwas the controlling opinion. Th is is the rare case in \\nwhich stare decisis should not control, and this Court \\nshould hold that the Sixth Amendment requires state juries\\u2014like federal juries\\u2014to be unanimous. \\nARGUMENT \\nI. THE HISTORY OF THE FOURTEENTH \\nAMENDMENT COMPELS THE INCORPORATION OF THE SIXTH AMENDMENT UNANIMOUS JURY TRIAL \\nRIGHT.  \\nThis Court recently reiterated that \\u201c[a] Bill of \\nRights protection is inco rporated . . . if it is \\n\\u2018fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty,\\u2019 or \\n\\u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\\u2019s history and tradition.\\u2019\\u201d  \\nTimbs v. Indiana , 139 S. Ct. 682, 687 (2019) (quoting \\nMcDonald v. Chicago , 561 U.S. 742, 767 (2010)). \\nAccordingly, when determining whether a provision of the Bill of Rights is \\u201cfundamental\\u201d or \\u201cdeeply rooted,\\u201d the Court reckons with the historical context \\nof the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e.g. , McDonald , \\n561 U.S. at 770-78 (explicating the position of \\u201cthe \\n4 \\n \\n Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth \\nAmendment\\u201d); id. at 776 (relying on \\u201c[e]vidence from \\nthe period immediately following the ratification of \\nthe Fourteenth Amendment\\u201d); Timbs , 139 S. Ct. at \\n688 (same). An examination of this history compels the incorporation of the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement. \\nIn the aftermath of the Civil War, Southern \\nwhites were neither prepared nor willing to accept the \\n\\u201cfundamentally altered . . . racial status quo in the \\nSouth.\\u201d\\n2 The Thirteenth Amendment\\u2019s ratification \\nabolished slavery in 1865.3 Nevertheless, recalcitrant \\nSouthern states persisted in \\u201csubjugat[ing] newly \\nfreed slaves and maintain[ing] the prewar racial \\nhierarchy.\\u201d Timbs , 139 S. Ct. at 688. Between  1865 \\nand 1866, Southern legislatures accomplished this by passing discriminatory statutes, known as Black \\nCodes, which \\u201creduce[d] blacks to a status somewhere \\nbetween that of slaves (which they no longer were) \\nand full free people (which most white southerners opposed).\\u201d\\n4 And Black Codes governed a wide range of \\naspects of everyday life, including the extent of African American access to the courtroom.\\n5 For \\n                                                \\n2 Paul Finkelman, John Bingham and the Background to the \\nFourteenth Amendment , 36 Akron L.

Pol. & Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 389, 402-03 \\n5 \\n \\n example, under the Alabama Black Code, while Black \\npeople were allowed to testify in court, they were limited to testifying \\u201conly in cases in which freedmen, \\nfree negroes and mulattoes are parties.\\u201d\\n6  Other \\nstates passed similar Black Codes, all of which had the same effect: Black people could not testify in civil \\ncases between white people or in criminal cases in \\nwhich a white person harmed another white person.\\n7  \\n\\u201c[T]he law in effect declared that blacks were not \\n\\u2018equal\\u2019 to whites and that their testimony was not as \\u2018good\\u2019 as that of whites.\\u201d\\n8 \\nIt was against this backdrop of state-legislated \\nrefusal \\u201cto accept that the freed people were entitled \\nto liberty, equality, or even fundamental legal \\nrights,\\u201d9 that the need for Congress to create legal \\nprotections for formerly enslaved African Americans \\nbecame clear. In December 1865, Congress created \\nthe Joint Committee on Reconstruction, and \\nauthorized the Committee \\u201cto investigate conditions \\nin the South.\\u201d10  \\nThis investigation showed that with respect to \\nformerly enslaved Black people, \\u201cit was impossible to abandon them, without securing them their rights as \\n                                                \\n(2004).

As this Court said in Duncan v.

The story of two Black Louisianans who recently served as jurors\\u2014Willie Newton and Bobbie Howard\\u2014compellingly illustrates this point.\\n64 \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard were both born and \\nraised in the small town of Houma, in Terrebonne Parish; the same town where Evangelisto Ramos \\nworked. Mr. Newton, who is 72 years old, runs a \\nfamily business selling burial vaults.

Everything quoted is from their interviews with counsel unless attributed otherwise. \\n19 \\n \\n year-old Mr. Howard has his own accounting practice. \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard both attended segregated schools growing up. In fact, they went to \\nthe same high school, as there was only one in the \\nParish that educated Black children. \\nIn 2014, two years before Mr. Ramos faced trial \\nfor second-degree murder, Mr. Newton and Mr. Howard were selected to serve on the jury for the trial \\nof Matthew Allen, a 20-year-old Black man also \\naccused of second-degree murder. The prosecution\\u2019s \\ntheory was that Mr. Allen intentionally shot and killed the victim; Mr. Allen\\u2019 s defense to the charge \\nwas that he acted in self-defense.\\n65 Mr. Newton and \\nMr. Howard were the only Black jurors. The other ten \\njurors on Mr. Allen\\u2019s jury were white.  \\nMr. Newton vividly recalled  his feelings when he \\nsaw the jury\\u2019s composition: \\u201cBobby and I saw from the beginning that our vote wasn\\u2019t going to matter. We \\nwere outnumbered.\\u201d \\u201cI could have just stayed home.\\u201d \\n\\u201cAin\\u2019t no difference we can make.\\u201d Mr. Newton felt \\ndoubly distraught when he saw that Mr. Allen had a \\u201cbad judge\\u201d who had been reprimanded for wearing blackface.\\n66 Mr. Newton thought to himself, \\u201cBuddy, \\nyou\\u2019re doomed.\\u201d \\n                                                \\n65 See State v. Allen , 2015-0675, 2015 WL 6951570, at *2 (La. Ct. \\nApp. 2015).  \\n66 In 2004, Judge Timothy Ellender was suspended for wearing \\nblackface, handcuffs, and a jail jumpsuit to a Halloween party.  \\nSee Seth Fox, Houma Judge Suspended for Wearing Blackface \\nHalloween Costume , Houma Today (Dec. 13, 2014), \\n20 \\n \\n Reflecting back, Mr. Newton and Mr. Howard \\nthought Mr. Allen\\u2019s race worked against him with the white jurors. \\u201cThey see a Black defendant in a drug \\ndeal and maybe think \\u2018he\\u2019s hustling corner to corner, \\nlet\\u2019s teach him a lesson,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Howard speculated. Mr. Newton echoed this sentiment: \\u201cI think they saw him \\nas a potential threat to the community.\\u201d  \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard looked at Mr. Allen \\ndifferently. They saw a young man who may have \\nmade a mistake, but who still had a life ahead of him. \\nMr. Howard thought these differing perspectives could be due to the fact \\u201ctheir life experiences were different.\\u201d  \\nAfter listening intently to the evidence, both Mr. \\nHoward and Newton favored finding Mr. Allen guilty of manslaughter. \\u201cI thought about his age. I thought he deserved a second chance,\\u201d Mr. Howard said quietly. Mr. Newton confirmed that he \\u201cnever thought \\nit was second-degree murder\\u201d and proposed to his \\nfellow jurors that Mr. Allen should be convicted of \\nmanslaughter, not murder.  \\nDeliberations gave both men hope that at least \\nsome of the white jurors would see the evidence their \\nway and would find Mr. Allen guilty of manslaughter, \\nnot murder. Mr. Howard recalled that one juror, a white woman, seemed to be leaning in favor of manslaughter going into lunch. Mr. Newton remembered there being two or three white jurors \\n                                                \\nhttps://www.houmatoday.com/article/DA/20041213/News/60809\\n9465/HC/.   \\n21 \\n \\n who seemed to think manslaughter was the just \\nconviction. \\nThings took a turn after lunch, however. Mr. \\nHoward recounted that he and Mr. Newton had lunch together, while the white jurors ate together. When they returned from lunch, all ten white jurors wanted to vote for second-degree murder; there was no convincing them otherwise, \\u201ceveryone was set in their \\nways.\\u201d  \\nMr. Newton\\u2019s prediction that his vote wouldn\\u2019t \\nmatter proved prescient. Th e jury convicted Mr. Allen \\nof second-degree murder by a vote of 10-2. All ten \\nwhite jurors voted for guilt. Mr. Newton and Mr. \\nHoward voted not guilty. \\nWhat took place troubled Mr. Howard and Mr. \\nNewton. Mr. Howard recalled: \\u201cI pretty much felt sorry for the young man, to tell you the truth.\\u201d Mr. \\nNewton was more shaken: \\u201cIt hurt me real bad when \\nI looked at that young man, and I looked at his mother and father, and I knew they weren\\u2019t going to see him again, not unless they go up to Angola.\\u201d\\n67 Indeed, Mr. \\nNewton felt the effects of the trial long after it was \\nover: \\u201cWhen I left that jury, it took me a couple of \\nweeks to get myself together. Serving on that jury \\ntook something out of me.\\u201d Mr. Allen, who entered prison for a crime he a when he was only 20, continues to serve a life sentence in Angola Prison.   \\n                                                \\n67 Adelson et al., supra note 57. \\n22 \\n \\n Mr. Newton realized that what happened in Mr. \\nAllen\\u2019s trial probably happened in many others, causing him to wonder, \\u201cHow many others had passed \\nthis way . . . and got the same treatment this boy got.\\u201d \\nThe trial, Mr. Newton explained, made him feel like his \\u201cvoice didn\\u2019t matter,\\u201d \\u201ca second-class citizen.\\u201d  \\nThis experience confirmed for Mr. Newton that \\nLouisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury system was unfair to \\nBlack defendants and Black jurors. In his opinion, the \\nprosecutors \\u201cfound a way to get around the system\\u201d \\nby limiting the number of Black people on Mr. Allen\\u2019s jury to two, knowing they only needed ten votes for a conviction. The trial shook Mr. Newton\\u2019s confidence in \\nthe fairness of Louisiana\\u2019s justice system: \\u201cI know I \\ncouldn\\u2019t sit there and think I\\u2019d get a fair trial.\\u201d  \\nMr. Newton took solace in the fact Louisiana \\nvoters repealed the non-unanimous jury provision last year.\\n68 He expressed that while he does think that \\n\\u201cjustice was served\\u201d during Mr. Allen\\u2019s trial, he felt \\n\\u201cencouraged\\u201d and \\u201cempowered\\u201d to serve on a jury now that his vote was guaranteed to matter. Mr. Howard \\nsaid that he, too, is ready to perform his \\u201ccivic duty\\u201d \\nand serve on a jury under Louisiana\\u2019s new unanimous jury scheme.  \\nMr. Newton and Mr. Howard\\u2019s experience is a \\nstark example of the indign ities inflicted upon Black \\npeople by Louisiana\\u2019s non-unanimous jury provision. It is a reminder that, until last year, Louisiana\\u2019s non-\\nunanimous jury system worked the way its racist \\n                                                \\n68 Oregon is now the only state with a non-unanimous jury \\nprovision. \\n23 \\n \\n proponents intended\\u2014to more easily convict Black \\ndefendants and to silence Black jurors. What makes this even worse, is that this system, conceived from \\nracism, has been operating with this Court\\u2019s blessing \\nfor 47 years. Apodaca must be overruled. This Court \\nshould hold that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Sixth Amendment\\u2019s unanimity \\nrequirement against the States.  \\n \\n  \\n24 \\n \\n CONCLUSION \\nLDF respectfully urges this Court to hold that the \\nFourteenth Amendment incorporates the Sixth \\nAmendment\\u2019s unanimity requirement against the States.  \\nRespectfully submitted,  \\n \\nSherrilyn A.

As a non-profit organization, the \\nCatholic League is dedicated to safeguarding the \\nreligious freedom and free speech rights of Catholics \\nwhenever and wherever they are threatened. Both \\nthe letter and spirit of the First Amendment \\nmotivate every aspect of the Catholic League\\u2019s work defending the right of all Catholics\\u2014lay and clergy \\nalike\\u2014to participate in American public life without \\ndefamation or discrimination. \\nTo advance these efforts, the Catholic League \\nsubmits this brief in support of the Petitioners. \\n  \\n                                           \\n1 Pursuant to Rule 37.3(a), both the Petitioners and the \\nRespondents have provided blanket consents to the filing of \\namicus briefs.

While debating the extent to \\nwhich the Constitution should enshrine protections for religious freedom during the First Congress, \\nRepresentative Daniel Carroll of Maryland\\u2014one of \\nthe few Catholics among the Constitution\\u2019s \\nFramers\\u2014remarked \\u201cthe rights of conscience are, in \\ntheir nature, of peculiar delicacy, and will little bear \\nthe gentlest touch of governmental hand.\\u201d 1 Annals \\nof Cong. 757-58 (Joseph Gales ed., 1834) (Aug. 15, 1789). \\nNowhere are the rights of the religious more \\ndelicate than when they intersect with the freedom \\nto put faith into action, belief into words. If the \\nrobust religious freedom protections guaranteed by \\nour Constitution are to have any meaning, they must \\nbe capable of shielding a sincere religious believer from being coerced into speaking against the core \\ntenants of her faith. To hold otherwise would be to \\npermit the heavy hand of government to extinguish \\nreligious practice. This the Constitution will not \\nallow. \\nThe Founders understood that the First \\nAmendment, as drafted, protected all religious sects in their right to speak freely in accordance with t\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"gpt_response_1\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3977,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"(I) QUESTION PRESENTED\\n(III) TABLE OF CONTENTS\\nStatement of interest\\nRelevant statutory provisions\\nIntroduction\\nStatement\\nA.

While debating the extent to \\nwhich the Constitution should enshrine protections for religious freedom during the First Congress, \\nRepresentative Daniel Carroll of Maryland\\u2014one of \\nthe few Catholics among the Constitution's \\nFramers\\u2014remarked \\\"the rights of conscience are, in \\ntheir nature, of peculiar delicacy, and will little bear \\nthe gentlest touch of governmental hand.\\\" 1 Annals \\nof Cong. 757-58 (Joseph Gales ed., 1834) (Aug. 15, 1789). \\nNowhere are the rights of the religious more \\ndelicate than when they intersect with the freedom \\nto put faith into action, belief into words. If the \\nrobust religious freedom protections guaranteed by \\nour Constitution are to have any meaning, they must \\nbe capable of shielding a sincere religious believer from being coerced into speaking against the core \\ntenants of her faith. To hold otherwise would be to \\npermit the heavy hand of government to extinguish \\nreligious practice. This the Constitution will not \\nallow. \\nThe Founders understood that the First \\nAmendment, as drafted, protected all religious sects in their right to speak freely in accordance with their \\nfaith. Indeed, the Founding Generation believed \\nprotections for religious lib erty to be of utmost \\nimport. Since its founding, America has been gripped \\n 3 \\nin debate over religious liberty. Even before the \\ncolonies declared their independence, there were \\nenergetic discussions over the bounds of religious \\ntoleration versus a full freedom to exercise religion \\n(with only limited exceptions). Ultimately, the \\nConstitution's drafters settled on James Madison's \\nview of an unalienable right to practice one's \\nreligious faith. Owed to an understanding that the Governor of the Universe supersedes any earthly \\nauthority, religious convictions were understood to \\ncommand greater deference than mere personal \\nopinions. Where opinion was required to yield to the \\nlaw, tensions between law and religious belief often \\nresulted in exemption for the believer. \\nThe Founding Generation also viewed religious \\nliberty as encompassing more  than mere matters of \\nconscience or decisions on the rightness or wrongness \\nof acts. Instead, the full ex ercise of religion offered a \\nright to act in accordance with one's faith and, \\nnecessarily, included protection from government \\ncompelled speech that violated a believer's firmly \\nheld religious convictions. This distinction was \\nperhaps most clearly expressed in the early colonies' \\nanti-Catholic prejudices. In colonial Georgia, for example, while all worshipers were vested by its \\nCharter with a liberty of conscience, Catholics were \\nexpressly excluded from protections for the more \\nrobust free exercise of religion. McConnell, The \\nOrigins and Historical Understanding of Free \\nExercise of Religion, 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1409, 1489-90 \\n(1989) (hereinafter McConnell, Origins). \\nInformed by the debates and experiences of their \\ntime, the Founders opted to include among the Constitution's protections the more extensive free \\n 4 \\nexercise of religion. In so doing, they extended the \\nmaximum protections available to all who professed \\nbelief in a Universal Sovereign. These protections, it \\nwas understood, included a right to act out belief and \\nto speak, or refrain from speaking, freely, in \\naccordance with faith. \\nWith this understanding as background, it is \\nclear the First Amendment provides dual protections for religious expression (or non-expression) in its \\nguarantees of free speech and free religious exercise. \\nThis reality compels the conclusion that religious \\nspeech enjoys the highest constitutional protection. \\nCertainly, this is consistent with the Founders' \\nunderstanding of robust religious liberty protections, \\nas revealed in the text, history, and tradition of the First Amendment. \\nThis Court's recent religious liberty jurisprudence \\nconcurs with the Founders' view of full-throated \\nreligious liberty protection. Religious observers have \\nwelcomed the relief from government oppression. No \\nlonger can religious believers be excluded solely \\nbecause of their religious identity. Free are the religious to express their religious views without fear \\nof government reprisal. This Court's precedents have \\nbeen unequivocal: if government can achieve its \\nmeans without burdening religion, the Constitution \\nalmost always requires that it must. \\nAnother truism is derived from this Court's \\nprecedents. When religious liberty concerns are coupled with free expression, the Constitution \\ndemands the most exacting scrutiny. That is because \\nthe First Amendment, as understood from the \\nFounding, provides special protection for the \\n 5 \\nreligious, their right to speak freely, and their right \\nto refrain from speaking. Distinct from pure \\ncommercial speech, religious speech demands a \\nhigher constitutional protection. That is why, to \\nAmicus Curiae's knowledge, government compelled \\nreligious speech has never been held to survive strict \\nscrutiny. \\nAgainst this backdrop, the Tenth Circuit's opinion \\ncannot stand. Although purporting to apply strict scrutiny, the Tenth Circuit's analysis is rife with \\nflaws, each one fatal to the court's conclusion. From \\nthe outset, the Tenth Circuit failed to recognize the \\npreferred status of Ms. Smith's free speech rights, \\ngrounded as they are in her religious beliefs. This \\nfailure is only compounded by the Tenth Circuit's lethargic narrow-tailoring analysis. Far from the \\nexacting analysis this Court requires, the Tenth \\nCircuit settles into a now familiar pattern to those of \\nfaith\\u2014ostracizing Ms. Smith from society because of \\nher religious identity. \\nOnce again, this Court must reverse yet another \\nassault on religious freedom by declaring that where, as here, free speech and religion intersect, \\nconstitutional protections are at their greatest. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 6 \\nARGUMENT \\nI. AS ORIGINALLY UNDERSTOOD , THE FIRST \\nAMENDMENT PROTECTED THE RIGHT OF THE \\nRELIGIOUS TO SPEAK AND TO REMAIN SILENT . \\nThe First Amendment is \\\"unique in form among \\namendments to the Constitution.\\\"2 It is drafted, not \\nas a grant of privileges or rights to the people, but as \\na disability on Congress' ability to act. Report to the Attorney General, supra  note 2, at 15\\u201316. In its \\nentirety, the First Amendment reads: \\nCongress shall make no law respecting \\nan establishment of religion, or \\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; or \\nabridging the freedom of speech, or of \\nthe press; or the right of the people \\npeaceably to assemble, and to petition \\nthe Government for a redress of grievances.  \\nU.S.\\n Const., Amdt. 1. \\nIn barring certain kinds of laws, the First \\nAmendment recognizes a pre-existing \\\"immun[ity] from such legislative action.\\\" Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral, supra note 2, at 16. This reflects an \\nunderstanding by the Founding Generation that these \\\"are pre-existent rights\\u2014inalienable rights\\u2014\\n                                           \\n2 O f f i c e  o f  L e g a l  P o l i c y ,  D e p t  o f  J u s t i c e ,  R e p o r t  t o  t h e  \\nAttorney General: Religious Li berty Under the Free Exercise \\nClause at 15 (1986) (hereinafter Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral). \\n 7 \\nand not mere civil privileges conferred by a \\nbenevolent sovereign.\\\" Id. \\nTaken together, the text, history, and philosophy \\nof the First Amendment establish the principle that \\n\\\"the government has no right to interfere with the \\nfree exercise of religion\\\" unless the \\\"government \\naction is necessary to prevent manifest danger to the \\nexistence of the state; to protect public peace, safety, \\nand order; or to secure the religious liberty of \\nothers.\\\" Id., at v. And, even then, only if the \\ngovernment deploys \\\"the least restrictive means \\nnecessary to protect these interests.\\\" Id. This is true \\nas a matter of the First Amendment's Religious Liberty Clauses. And because freedom of religion \\ncannot be divorced from freedom of expression, it is \\neven more true when the government tries to force a \\nbeliever to speak in a way that cannot be reconciled \\nwith her religious convictions. \\nA. Religious liberty was profoundly \\nimportant to the Founding Generation; \\nreligious convictions were understood \\nto receive greater deference than mere \\npersonal opinion. \\n1. The Founding Generation was uniquely \\nattuned to issues regarding the proper relationship \\nbetween religion and government. Indeed, at the time of America's founding there was \\\"an intense and \\ncontroversial theoretical debate\\\" of these issues \\ninvolving \\\"[m]ost of the great political thinkers of the \\nperiod.\\\" McConnell, Origins, at 1430. These thinkers \\ninformed the Founders' own debates on the issue and \\nundoubtedly \\\"influenced the American solution to \\nthe problem.\\\" Id.  \\n 8 \\nJohn Locke, perhaps more than any other \\nphilosopher who contributed to the ideas \\nunderpinning America's founding, provided the \\n\\\"most extensive\\\" discussion of religion and most \\ndirectly influenced the Framers' drafting of the First \\nAmendment. Id. Locke was an early and influential \\ntheoretical thinker and advocate for religious freedom. Id., at 1431. In his view \\\"religious rivalry \\nand intolerance\\\" were \\\"among the most important of political problems,\\\" and \\\"[r]eligious intolerance was inconsistent both with public peace and with good \\ngovernment.\\\" Id. \\nLocke's solution, however, was an \\\"understanding \\nof religious toleration,\\\" that \\\"expressly precludes free \\nexercise exemptions.\\\" Id., at 1435. To Locke, when \\n\\\"individual conscience conflicts with the governmental policy, the government will always \\nprevail and the individual will always be forced to \\nsubmit or suffer the punishment.\\\" Id. Locke's \\ninfluence on the drafters of the First Amendment makes it all the more remarkable that his view did \\nnot triumph with America's founding. \\nThe American Revolution upended the \\npreexisting relationship between religion and government, especially in states where the Anglican \\nChurch had the most influence. Id., at 1436. \\n\\\"America was in the wake of a great religious \\nrevival,\\\" that brought with it a \\\"drive for religious \\nfreedom.\\\" Id., at 1437\\u201338. Along with this drive came \\na push from \\\"religious supporters of disestablishment and free exercise\\\" to enshrine \\n\\\"constitutional protections\\\" for religious freedoms \\\"at the federal level.\\\" Id., at 1440. \\n 9 \\nThis movement was encapsulated in debate \\nsurrounding the religious liberty clause in Virginia's \\n1776 Bill of Rights. When George Mason proposed \\nusing the Lockean phrase \\\"toleration of religion,\\\" \\nJames Madison objected, complaining that the \\nphrase implied an act of legislative grace (which, to \\nLocke, it did). Id. , at 1443. Madison was not alone \\namong the Founding Generation in rejecting this concept. George Washin gton and Thomas Paine \\nsimilarly eschewed \\\"toleration,\\\" decrying its \\nimplication of government \\\"indulgence\\\" rather than a \\nfundamental, preexisting right. Id., at 1443\\u201344. \\nMoreover, Madison objected to Mason's proposal \\nbecause it excepted from even the \\\"toleration\\\" of \\nreligious freedom any instance where \\\"under color of \\nreligion any man disturb the peace, the happiness, or \\nsafety of society.\\\" See G. Hunt, James Madison and \\nReligious Liberty, 1 Ann. Rep. Am. Hist. A. 163, 166 \\n(1901). It was Madison's belief that such phrasing \\n\\\"might easily be so twisted as to oppress religious \\nsects under the excuse that they disturbed 'the \\npeace, the happiness, or safety of society.'\\\" Id. \\nMadison's objections were heard by Virginia's \\nassembly. As adopted, Virginia's Bill of Rights \\npromised that all \\\"are equally entitled to the free \\nexercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience,\\\" and reminded only \\\"that\\n it is the mutual \\nduty of all to practice Christian forbearance, love, and charity towards each other.\\\" Report to the \\nAttorney General, supra  note 2, at 102\\u201303. \\n2. This early debate between Madison and Mason \\nbears witness to what this Court has long noted\\u2014\\nthat Madison was \\\"the leading architect of the \\n 10\\nreligion clauses of the First Amendment.\\\" Hosanna-\\nTabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v. \\nEEOC , 565 U.S. 171, 184 (2012) (internal quotation \\nmarks omitted). Madison's rejection of religious \\ntolerance in favor of full and free religious expression permeates his Memorial and Remonstrance . \\nExplaining that \\\"[t]he Religion then of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every \\nman,\\\" Madison understood that it is not just \\\"the \\nright of every man to exercise it as these may \\ndictate,\\\" but further \\\"the duty of every man to render \\nto the Creator such homage, and such only, as he \\nbelieves to be acceptable to him.\\\" J. Madison, \\nMemorial and Remonstrance \\u00a7 1 (1785), reprinted in \\nEverson v. Bd. of Educ. , 330 U.S. 1, 64 (1947). This \\nright, Madison admonished, \\\"is in its nature an unalienable right.\\\" Id. \\nMadison expounded his view that \\\"[t]his duty is \\nprecedent both in order of time and degree of \\nobligation, to the claims of Civil Society.\\\" Id. Before \\nanyone is \\\"a member of Civil Society,\\\" they are \\\"considered as a subject of the Governor of the \\nUniverse.\\\" Id. For this reason, \\\"in matters of \\nReligion, no man's right is abridged by the institution of Civil Society.\\\" Id. But Madison went \\nfurther. \\\"[I]f religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that \\nof the Legislative Body.\\\" Id., at \\u00a7 2, reprinted in \\nEverson , 330 U.S., at 65. Legislators who \\n\\\"encroach[]\\\" on the rights of the people, Madison \\nsaid, \\\"exceed the commission from which they derive their authority, and are Tyrants.\\\" Id. \\nRecognizing that Madison's Memorial and \\nRemonstrance is not law, see City of Boerne v. Flores , \\n 11\\n521 U.S. 507, 541 (1997) (Scalia, J., concurring), it \\nnonetheless offers a clear understanding of why the \\nFounding Generation thought it so crucial to \\nmemorialize the inalienable freedom of religion in \\nthe First Amendment. And Madison's defense of the \\nAmerican conception of religious liberty merely \\nechoed the prevalent thought at the founding \\\"of the \\ndifference between religious faith and other forms of human judgment.\\\" McConnell, Origins, at 1496. \\nAt the Founding, the prevailing view was that the \\n\\\"opinions of individuals\\\" can not take \\\"precedence \\nover the decisions of civil society.\\\" Id. The same was \\nnot true for religious convictions. \\\"Conflicts arising from religious convictions were conceived not as a \\nclash between the judgment of the individual and of \\nthe state, but as a conflict between earthly and \\nspiritual sovereigns.\\\" Id. In those instances, the \\nperson holding the religious conviction \\\"was not seen as the instigator of the conflict; the believer was simply caught between the inconsistent demands of \\ntwo rightful authorities, through no fault of his own.\\\" \\nId. This view is essential to understanding the \\nFounders' belief that \\\"freedom of religion is unalienable because it is a duty to God and not a \\nprivilege of the individual.\\\" Id., at 1497. \\n3. Bolstering this understanding, the historical \\nrecord surrounding adoption of the Bill of Rights \\nsuggests that the First Amendment's use of the term \\\"religion\\\" was a deliberate choice. See McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1488. Although \\\"[t]he recorded debates \\nin\\\" both chambers of Congress \\\"cast little light on the \\nmeaning of the free exercise clause,\\\" looking at \\nsuccessive drafts of the clause from its consideration \\nand debate in the First Congress are especially \\n 12\\nenlightening. Id., at 1481, 1483. While earlier drafts \\nof the First Amendment used the phrase \\\"rights of \\nconscience,\\\" the final version that emerged enshrined in the First Amendment a protection for the \\\"free \\nexercise of religion.\\\" Id., at 1488. This phrasing lends \\nfurther support to the Founders' understanding of religious freedoms. \\nTo the Founders, \\\"[b]elief in a Supreme Being \\nwas\\\" essential to \\\"religion.\\\" Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral, supra  note 2, at 9. Indeed, \\\"[t]he historical \\nmaterials uniformly equate 'religion' with belief in God or in gods.\\\" McConnell, Origins, at 1493. These references \\\"can be extended without distortion to \\ntranscendent extrapersonal authorities not \\nenvisioned in traditionally theistic terms\\\"\\u2014for \\nexample, Madison's use of \\\"Creator,\\\" \\\"Governor of \\nthe Universe,\\\" and \\\"Universal Sovereign,\\\" imply \\\"an attempt at a definition more compendious than the \\nfamiliar Judeo-Christian God, but it retains the distinction between transcendent authority and \\npersonal judgment.\\\" Id.  \\nReligion, as understood by the Founders and \\nexpressed in the First Amendment, then, is best \\ndefined to encompass \\\"a system of beliefs, whether \\npersonally or institutionally held, prompted by the \\nacceptance of transcendent realities or \\nacknowledging extratemporal actions.\\\" Report to the \\nAttorney General, supra note 2, at 26\\u201327. This \\ninterpretation of religion is both accurate to the Founders' understanding and consistent with their view that religion encompasses \\\"duties that were \\nbeyond the jurisdiction of the state either to \\nprescribe or to proscribe.\\\" Id., at 9. To the Founders, \\nreligion encompassed a subservience to a \\n 13\\n\\\"transcendent reality,\\\" which if abandoned could \\nunleash \\\"extratemporal consequences.\\\" Id., at 29. \\nThis explains their motivation to preserve a robust freedom from government \\\"interfere[nce] with such \\nbeliefs or duties.\\\" Id. \\nB. The Founding Generation's understanding of religious liberty \\nencompassed protection for believers \\nfrom compelled speech that violates \\nfirmly held religious beliefs. \\n1. The least controversial point about the phrase \\n\\\"free exercise\\\" is that \\\"by definition, the words denote action or activity.\\\" Id., at 19. To the Founders, \\nreligious liberty undoubtedly included \\\"religiously motivated conduct  as well as belief.\\\" McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1488 (emphasis added). This point bears emphasis because of this Court's history rejecting \\nsuch a reading. See  Reynolds v. United States , 98 \\nU.S. 145, 164 (1878); but see Fulton v. City of Phila. , \\n141 S. Ct. 1868, 1913 (2021) (Alito, J., concurring) \\n(noting \\\"[t]he Court ha[s] repudiated that distinction\\\" in Reynolds  \\\"that the Free Exercise \\nClause protects beliefs, not conduct\\\"). \\nIn substituting the \\\"rights of conscience\\\" in favor \\nof a protection for the \\\"free exercise of religion,\\\" the \\nFramer's chose a phrase that \\\"strongly connoted \\naction,\\\" in place of one that suggested mere opinion \\nor belief. McConnell, Origins, at 1489. Leading \\ndictionaries of that era defined \\\"exercise\\\" to include \\n\\\"[l]abour of the body,\\\" \\\"[t]ask; that which one is \\nappointed to perform,\\\" \\\"[a]ct of divine worship, \\nwhether public or private,\\\" or \\\"[t]o use or practice.\\\" See id.  (collecting dictionary definitions). Conscience, \\n 14\\non the other hand, was more likely to imply a \\n\\\"natural knowledge, or the faculty that decides on \\nthe right or wrong of actions.\\\" Id. (quoting N. \\nWebster, A Dictionary of The English Language 301 (New Haven 1807)). \\nParticularly instructive on this distinction is the \\nGeorgia Charter of 1732. The Charter included \\\"a \\nliberty of conscience allowe d in the worship of God, \\nto all persons,\\\" but reserved the more exclusive right to \\\"a free exercise of religion,\\\" only to \\\"all such persons, except papists.\\\" Id., at 1489\\u201390. By granting \\nCatholics only a liberty of conscience, but not the free exercise of religion, the Georgia Charter necessarily \\nreserved a fuller right to non-Catholic worshipers. \\nOne scholar has observed that \\\"[t]he most plausible \\nreading of the provision is that it permitted Catholics \\nto believe what they wished . . . but did not permit \\nthem to put their faith into action.\\\" Id., at 1490. \\nBy including a full and robust \\\"free exercise of \\nreligion\\\" within the First Amendment, the Founders understood that they were protecting not only the \\nright for the religious to believe what their faith \\ntaught, but to put those beliefs into action. To \\nconclude otherwise would be to \\\"trivialize the idea of \\nreligion by separating thought from life, faith from \\nworks.\\\" Report to the Attorney General, supra note \\n2, at 31. Possessing \\\"a right to believe something in one's mind without the freedom to utter it, advocate it, or even translate it into life,\\\" is hardly a \\nsubstantive freedom at all. Id., at 31\\u201332. \\n2. Consistent with the Founders' understanding \\nof a robust religious liberty protection that included \\nthe right to act out your faith was the axiom that \\n 15\\naction naturally includes expression or the freedom \\nto refrain from expression that conflicts with belief. \\nAlthough early religious liberty controversies were \\nrelatively limited, the historical record includes \\nexamples of protections for religious exercise \\nintertwined with such expressive activity. \\nAn early source of common conflict, for example, \\narose around the issue of oath requirements. Oaths \\nserved as \\\"the principal means of ensuring honest \\ntestimony and solemnizing obligations.\\\" McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1467. But many early religious sects \\nrefused to take an oath, believing it was in conflict \\nwith the teachings of the New Testament.3 Id. \\nBecause oaths were required before court testimony, this refusal often left these sincere religious objectors \\nwithout access to the court system. Id. \\nIn response, many of the early colonies adopted \\nalternatives, allowing relig ious dissenters to take a \\npledge or make an affirmation rather than to swear \\nan oath. Id., at 1467\\u201368 (\\\"By 1789, virtually all of the \\nstates had enacted oath exemptions.\\\"). This simple solution permitted religious sects access to the court \\nsystem, without requiring them to act out of step \\n                                           \\n3 See Matthew 5:33-37 (\\\"Again, ye have heard that it hath \\nbeen said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, \\nbut shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: But I say unto you, \\nSwear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: Nor \\nby the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is \\nthe city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy \\nhead, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever \\nis more than these cometh of evil.\\\"). \\n 16\\nwith their religious beliefs or to make an expression \\nthey found incompatible with their faith. \\nA still more extreme example of laws yielding to \\nexpressive activities of religious sects in the \\nFounding Generation can be found in colonial \\nGeorgia. There, the Trus tees of Georgia granted \\ncertain groups of religious refugees a general exemption from the laws that allowed them \\\"to organize themselves in accordance with their own \\nfaith.\\\" Id., at 1471. One historia n described one such \\ngroup from Salzburg\\u2014which formed the town of Ebenezer\\u2014as \\\"a state within a state, a sort of \\ntheocracy under the direction of their minsters with \\ndaily conferences of the entire congregation in which \\nGod's guidance was invoked at the beginning and the \\nend.\\\" Id. Although these groups where required to \\nobey certain colonial laws pertaining to military service, property, and good governance, they were \\n\\\"otherwise free to govern themselves.\\\" Id. at 1471 \\nn.312 \\nAnother founding era example of religious \\nexemptions for expressive action appeared in North \\nCarolina and Maryland. There, laws exempted \\nmembers of certain religious sects from a \\nrequirement to remove their hat in court. Id. The \\nreligious objectors viewed such an action as \\\"a form of obeisance to secular authority forbidden by their \\nreligion.\\\" Id., at 1472. Rather than forcing members \\nof these sects to choose be tween access to the courts \\nor expressing themselves in violation of their religious beliefs, states offered an exemption. \\nWhile this example may seem trivial by today's \\nstandards, it was very mu ch on the minds of the \\n 17\\nFounding Generation. At the time, \\\"[o]ne of the most \\nnotorious courtroom cases of religious intolerance in \\nEngland involved William Penn's refusal to remove \\nhis hat when he appeared in court\\\" to face \\nindictment for speaking to  an unlawful assembly. Id. \\nWhen Penn refused to remove a court-furnished hat from his head in respect to the court, he was held in \\ncontempt and imprisoned. Id. This case attracted \\nsignificant attention in America, and undoubtedly influenced the exemptions passed in North Carolina and Maryland. Id. \\nIndeed, the importance of this exemption was \\ndemonstrated in debates over the Bill of Rights in \\nthe First Congress. Id., at 1472, n.320. In ridiculing \\nthe list of freedoms proposed to be protected, Theodore Sedgwick of Mass achusetts remarked \\\"they \\nmight have declared that a man should have a right to wear his hat if he pleased . . . but he would ask the \\ngentleman whether he thought it necessary to enter \\nthese trifles in a declaration of rights.\\\" Id. (citation \\nomitted). With unmistakable reference to the Penn case, John Page of Virginia replied: \\nThe gentleman from \\nMassachusetts . . . objects to the clause, \\nbecause the right is of so trivial a \\nnature. He supposes it no more \\nessential than whether a man has a \\nright to wear his hat or not; but let me \\nobserve to him that such rights have \\nbeen opposed, and a man has been obliged to pull off his hat when he \\nappeared before the face of authority; \\npeople have also been prevented from \\n 18\\nassembling together on their lawful \\noccasions.  \\nId. (citation omitted). Certainly, the Founders were \\nacutely aware of the potential for abuse by \\nauthorities absent a robust religious liberty \\nprotection that clearly extended to actions, including \\nreligiously motivated expression or non-expression. \\n3. Taken together, the Free Exercise Clause and \\nthe Free Speech Clause elevate the freedom not to \\nspeak out of accordance with firmly held religious beliefs to the highest echelon of First Amendment \\nprotection. This conclusion is buttressed by the First \\nAmendment's other guarantees\\u2014e.g., freedom of \\nassembly and freedom to petition the government. If \\nthe Free Exercise Clause conferred nothing more \\nthan a \\\"right to express religious beliefs,\\\" it would \\n\\\"add nothing to the First Amendment, since that right is fully protected by the right to assemble, \\nspeak, and publish.\\\" Report to the Attorney General, \\nsupra note 2, at 19. Indeed, \\\"because religious \\nexpression is doubly protected by the constitutional \\ntext\\\" it would make little sense if it were \\\"less \\nprotected in practice.\\\" Id. , at 19, n.30. \\nThe examples cited above represent a clear \\nunderstanding by the Founding Generation that civil \\nlaws, even of general applicability, must yield when they conflict with religious expression or the freedom \\nto refrain from expression on the basis of a sincerely \\nheld religious belief. As it seems early legislative \\nbodies believed exemptions in such cases were \\nrequired by the principle of free exercise, it stands to \\nreason that the Framers understood \\\"similar \\napplications of the principle\\\" would guide the courts \\n 19\\nin these cases, once \\\"entrusted with the \\nresponsibility of enforcing\\\" First Amendment \\nguarantees. McConnell, Origins, at 1473. \\nAlthough there was a dearth of litigation over \\nreligious liberty protections in the early years of the \\nRepublic, what scarce examples exist support this \\nview. Consider, for example, the earliest state court \\nopinion addressing the issue of a religious liberty exemption, People v. Phillips . In that case, the court \\nheld that the New York Constitution protected a Catholic priest from compulsory testimony to \\nmatters learned while administering the Sacrament \\nof Confession. See  id., at 1504. \\nImportant to the Phillips court was the notion \\nthat requiring testimony from the priest to \\\"what he \\nreceives in confession, is to declare that there shall \\nbe no penance; and this important branch of the Roman Catholic religion would be thus annihilated.\\\" \\nId. (citation omitted). The court did not believe it was \\ncompatible with religious liberty to compel expression that would so eviscerate a core belief of Catholic faith. Rather than establishing a special \\nprivilege for adherents to the Catholic faith, though, \\nthe court viewed its actions as necessary to ensure \\nCatholics received the same  treatment as Protestants \\n(the dominant faith at the time) in the administration of their sacraments. Id., at 1504-05. \\nThe through line to the Founding Generation's \\nunderstanding of religious liberty was a belief that \\nsuch freedom was without substantive meaning if it did not encompass expression, and non-expression, \\nrooted in religious belief. Noted Nineteenth Century \\n 20\\nConstitutional commentator, Michigan Supreme \\nCourt Justice Thomas Cooley, explained: \\nAn earnest believer usually regards it as his duty to propagate his opinions, \\nand to bring others to his views. To \\ndeprive him of this right is to take from \\nhim the power to perform what he \\nconsiders a most sacred obligation.  \\nT. Cooley, A Treatise on the Constitutional \\nLimitations 665 (7th ed. 1903). Put another way: \\nreligious freedom, as understood by the Founders, \\nnecessarily encompasses the freedom to put belief \\ninto action, to engage in expression consistent with \\nthe dogmas of your faith, and to refrain from \\nexpression that may engender extratemporal consequences. \\nII. T\\nHIS COURT 'S PRECEDENTS \\u2014ESPECIALLY ITS \\nDEMANDING APPLICATION OF THE LEAST -\\nRESTRICTIVE MEANS TEST \\u2014DEMONSTRATE \\nAGREEMENT WITH THE FOUNDING GENERATION 'S \\nROBUST RELIGIOUS LIBERTY PROTECTIONS . \\nThis Court has a commendable history of \\nrecognizing the principles discussed above. In \\nparticular, the Court's recent religious liberty \\njurisprudence has been a welcome reprieve for \\nmembers of all faith communities who have been disheartened by the antagonism of some government \\nactors. See,  e.g., Espinoza v. Mont. Dept of Revenue , \\n140 S. Ct. 2246 (2020); Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. \\nColo. Civil Rights Comm'n , 138 S. Ct. 1719 (2018); \\nHosanna-Tabor , 565 U.S. 171. \\n 21\\nOf particular note is the Court's insistence on a \\nforceful application of the strict scrutiny test to any \\nrestriction that burdens religious liberty. Indeed, \\\"in \\nthis highly sensitive constitutional area, 'only the \\ngravest abuses, endangering paramount interests, \\ngive occasion for permissible limitation.'\\\" Sherbert v. \\nVerner , 374 U.S. 398, 406 (1963) (quoting Thomas v. \\nCollins, 323 U.S. 516, 530 (1945)). \\n1. A few examples illustrate the point. Consider \\nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. , where this \\nCourt considered a government-imposed contraceptive mandate on private employers who \\nbelieved such a requirement to be against their \\nreligious beliefs. 573 U.S. 682, 726 (2014).\\n4 While \\nassuming, without deciding, that the government's \\ninterest was compelling, the Court nonetheless found \\nthat the least-restrictive-means standard was not \\nmet. Id., at 728. Identifying alternative solutions to \\nthe rigid mandate imposed by the government, the Court explained, \\\"[t]he least-restrictive-means \\nstandard is exceptionally demanding.\\\" Id.  As Justice \\nKennedy explained, religious freedom \\\"implicates more than just freedom of belief\\\"; rather \\\"[i]t means, too, the right to express those beliefs and to establish \\none's religious (or nonreligious) self-definition in the \\npolitical, civic, and econ omic life of our larger \\n                                           \\n4 Hobby Lobby  was decided under the Religious Freedom \\nRestoration Act of 1993 (\\\"RFRA\\\"), which requires as an initial \\nmatter finding a substantial government burden on the exercise of religion; if such a burden exists, the Court must determine \\nwhether there is a compelling governmental interest and that \\nthe burden is the least restrictive means of furthering that \\ninterest. Hobby Lobby , 573 U.S., at 694-95. \\n 22\\ncommunity.\\\" Id., at 736\\u201337 (Kennedy, J., \\nconcurring). \\nIn another instance, this Court found Missouri \\nviolated a church's religious  liberty guarantees under \\nthe First Amendment when it categorically denied \\ntheir participation in a grant program for playground \\nsurface materials. Trinity Lutheran Church of \\nColumbia, Inc. v. Comer , 137 S. Ct. 2012, 2017, 2025 \\n(2017). Finding that otherwise eligible grant \\nrecipients were disqualified solely because of their \\nreligious nature, this Court held that such a penalty \\nworked against the free exercise of religion and \\\"triggers the most exacting scrutiny.\\\" Id., at 2021. \\nImportantly, the harm was not the denial of the grant itself but instead was Missouri's refusal to \\neven allow the church to compete with secular \\norganizations for grant funds solely on the basis of \\nits religious identity. Id., at 2022. \\nMore recently still, this Court took up the mantle \\nof religious liberties in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia . \\nDespite the Catholic Church's over two centuries of dedication to serving the needy children of \\nPhiladelphia, the City in 2018 stopped referring foster children to the Catholic Social Services (\\\"CSS\\\") \\nafter learning the organization would not \\\"consider \\nprospective foster parents in same-sex marriages.\\\" \\nFulton , 141 S. Ct., at 1874\\u201375. Finding that \\\"it is \\nplain\\\" the City burdens CSS's \\\"religious exercise by putting it to the choice of  curtailing its mission or \\napproving relationships inconsistent with its beliefs,\\\" this Court sought a review of whether such burden \\nwas \\\"constitutionally permissible.\\\" Id., at 1876. In \\ndetermining that Philadelphia imposed an unconstitutional burden on CSS's religious exercise, \\n 23\\nFulton  admonishes that \\\"so lo ng as the government \\ncan achieve its interests in a manner that does not \\nburden religion, it must do so.\\\" Id., at 1881. \\nTaken together, the precedents of this Court \\nestablish that an exacting analysis is required in \\nreligious liberty cases to determine whether the \\ngovernment's interest is compelling, and its burden \\nnarrowly tailored to achieve that interest. The \\nexistence of an alternative means for achieving even \\na compelling interest is nearly always fatal to the government's argument.  \\n2. When religious liberty and free expression \\nconcerns intertwine, this Court has been even less \\nhesitant to invalidate an infringing law. This \\nskepticism is warranted, as attempts to compel \\nexpression that conflicts with an individual's \\nreligious beliefs are nothing more than indirect \\nattempts to regulate religion itself. \\nIn 1943, this Court took issue with a West \\nVirginia law mandating a flag salute and pledge, when its application was challenged by a group of \\nJehovah's Witnesses who said such action violated \\ntheir religious beliefs. W. Va. State Bd. Of Educ. V. \\nBarnette , 319 U.S. 624 (1943). Refusing to find that \\n\\\"a Bill of Rights which guards the individual's right \\nto speak his own mind, left it open to public \\nauthorities to compel him to utter what is not on his \\nmind,\\\" the Barnette  Court blocked the law's \\nenforcement. Id. , at 634; see also  id., at 645 (Murphy, \\nJ., concurring) (recognizing \\\"[t]he right of freedom of thought and of religion as guaranteed by the \\nConstitution against State action includes both the \\nright to speak freely and the right to refrain from \\n 24\\nspeaking at all\\\"). Underlying the Court's opinion was \\nthe belief that \\\"[i]f there is any fixed star in our \\nconstitutional constellation, it is that no official, high \\nor petty, can prescribe what  shall be orthodox in \\npolitics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act \\ntheir faith therein.\\\" Id., at 642. \\nExpanding on the holding in Barnette , the Court \\nin Wooley v. Maynard  considered a religious \\nobjection to display of the New Hampshire state motto\\u2014\\\"Live Free or Die\\\"\\u2014on the license plate of a \\ncar owned by Jehovah's Witness. 430 U.S. 705 (1977). In Wooley , the Court expressly rejected the \\nidea that \\\"the State may constitutionally require an individual to participate in the dissemination of an \\nideological message by displaying it on his private \\nproperty.\\\" Id., at 713. \\nFoundational to its decision was the Court's \\nholding that the freedoms contained within the First \\nAmendment \\\"includes both the right to speak freely \\nand the right to refrain from speaking at all.\\\" Id., at \\n714. It matters not whether most agree with the message the State seeks to force a person to convey; the First Amendment unquestionably \\\"protects the \\nright of individuals to hold a point of view different \\nfrom the majority and to refu se to foster . . . an idea \\nthey find morally objectionable.\\\" Id. , at 715. Finding \\nthe existence of a governmental burden, the Court \\nwas left to question whether a substantial \\ngovernmental interest existed and, if so, whether the \\nburden was narrowly tailored to advance that \\ninterest. Even assuming a legitimate and substantial interest, the Court concluded \\\"that purpose cannot \\nbe pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental \\n 25\\npersonal liberties when the end can be more \\nnarrowly achieved.\\\" Id., at 716. New Hampshire \\nfailed that test. \\nIn still another line of cases, this Court found \\nthat it violated Constitutional protections to subject religious observants, who went door to door \\ndistributing religious materials and soliciting for the \\npurchase of religious books, to a government \\nsolicitation registration requirement. Murdock v. \\nPennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105 (1943); see also Follett v. \\nTown of McCormick , 321 U.S. 573 (1944). \\nAcknowledging that the practice was derived from the believer's understanding that he was \\\"obeying a \\ncommandment of God,\\\" the Court found that the First Amendment prohibited the imposition of a \\ngenerally applicable registration requirement to \\nengage in such conduct. Murdock , 319 U.S., at 108, \\n117. Indeed, the Court went out of its way to describe the literature being distributed as \\\"provocative, \\nabusive, and ill-mannered.\\\" Id., at 115\\u201316. \\nNevertheless, \\\"[p]lainly  a community may not \\nsuppress . . . the dissemination of views because they \\nare unpopular, annoying or distasteful.\\\" Id.,  at 116 \\nTo allow otherwise would \\\"be a complete repudiation of the philosophy of the Bill of Rights.\\\" Id. \\nThe Court went further still , establishing that the \\nmere fact the religious materials were being \\\"sold\\\" was not enough to transform \\\"evangelism into a \\ncommercial enterprise.\\\" Id., at 111. As such, the \\nCourt acknowledged heightened constitutional protections for \\\"those spreading their religious \\nbeliefs through the spoken and printed word.\\\" Id. As \\ncompared to purely commercial activity, \\\"[f]reedom of \\n 26\\npress, freedom of speech, fr eedom of religion are in a \\npreferred position.\\\" Id., at 115. \\nEven Employment Division v. Smith , often \\ncriticized as having watered down constitutional \\nreligious liberty protections, recognized the Court's \\nunique hostility toward burdens that implicate both \\nthe free exercise of religion and the freedom of \\nspeech. The \\\"First Amendment bars application of a \\nneutral, generally applicable law to religiously \\nmotivated action\\\" when that action \\\"involve[s] not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but the Free \\nExercise Clause in conjunction with other \\nconstitutional protections, such as freedom of \\nspeech.\\\" Empl. Div. v. Smith , 494 U.S. 872, 881\\u201382 \\n(1990). Even some preceden ts, decided on free speech \\ngrounds alone, were undoubtedly reinforced by \\ntouches of freedom-of-religion concerns. Id. \\n3. This much is clear: the arc of this Court's \\nprecedent bends in one incontrovertible direction. \\nScrutiny of any government burden is at its zenith \\nwhen the burden effects an individual's exercise of their religious beliefs in a manner that implicates \\nfree speech protections. This conclusion, rooted in the \\nhistory and tradition of religious exercise as \\nunderstood by the Founders and enshrined in the \\nFirst Amendment, demands that any such burden be \\nsubjected to the most rigorous application of strict \\nscrutiny analysis. \\nIt is precisely for this reason that, to the best of \\nAmicus Curiae's knowledge, the Court has never \\nissued an opinion finding that governmentally \\ncompelled religious speech satisfies strict scrutiny. \\nSee 303 Creative Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Elenis , 6 F.4th \\n 27\\n1160, 1191 (U.S. 10th Cir. 2021) (Tymkovich, C.J., \\ndissenting) (\\\"[T]he majority takes the remarkable\\u2014\\nand novel\\u2014stance that the government may force \\nMs. Smith to produce messages that violate her \\nconscience. . . . No case has ever gone so far.\\\"). \\nThis case should not be the first. \\nIII. THE TENTH CIRCUIT 'S OPINION CANNOT BE \\nSQUARED EITHER WITH THE FIRST \\nAMENDMENT 'S RICH HISTORY OR THIS COURT 'S \\nPROTECTION OF BELIEVERS ' FREE SPEECH \\nRIGHTS . \\nIn its permissive application of strict scrutiny, the \\nTenth Circuit bastardized this Court's protection of free speech rights, especially as applied to religious \\nexpression. If allowed to stand, its precedent will give license to courts across this Country to \\nhumiliate members of all religious sects by \\ncompelling them to speak in contravention of their \\nsincerely held religious beliefs. By purporting to \\napply strict scrutiny, the Tenth Circuit's opinion \\ncheapened the First Amendment rights of Catholics, \\nProtestants, Muslims, Jews, and all other believers alike. \\nLuckily, this precedent d oes not need to stand. \\nThis Court, once again, has an opportunity to \\nadmonish that the free speech protections of \\nbelievers are no less than non-believers and, in fact, \\nare heightened when faced with government \\nregulation that would compel speech antithetical to the tenants of a believer's faith. The First \\nAmendment commands such a result. \\n 28\\nAlthough the Tenth Circuit rightly concluded that \\nMs. Smith's website designs are \\\"pure speech,\\\" 303 \\nCreative LLC, 6 F.4th, at 1176, the Tenth Circuit \\nwrongly concludes that the commercial nature of Ms. \\nSmith's speech gives Colorado a regulatory hook to \\nlatch onto. Id., at 1179. By failing to acknowledge the \\nreligious nature of her objection to the would-be compelled speech, the Tenth Circuit did not afford \\nher First Amendment rights the \\\"preferred\\\" status \\nthey deserve.\\n5 Cf., Murdock , 319 U.S., at 115. What \\nis remarkable is that the religious nature of Ms. Smith's objection is not disputed. See 303 \\nCreative, 6 F. 4th, at 1172 (Ms. Smith is \\\"willing to create custom graphics and websites for gay, lesbian, \\nor bisexual clients . . . so long as the custom graphics \\nand websites do not violate [her] religious beliefs, as is true for all customers.\\\" (internal quotation marks \\nomitted)); id., at 1192 (Tymkovich, C.J., dissenting) \\n(\\\"In short, Colorado appear s to agree that Ms. Smith \\ndoes not distinguish between customers based on \\nprotected-class status and thus advances the aims of \\nCADA. But when any customer asks Ms. Smith to \\ncreate expressive content that violates her sincerely \\nheld beliefs, she will decline the request.\\\"). \\n                                           \\n5 Remarkably, the Tenth Circuit  suggests that its sweeping \\nholding may not apply to \\\"all artists\\\" if they were not engaged \\nin \\\"commercial activity,\\\" but rather \\\"commissioning a mural for some charitable purpose.\\\" 303 Creative , 6 F.4th, at 1182, n.6. To \\nsuggest that a local artist wh o refuses to paint a Christian \\nmural for a church may enjoy more constitutional protections \\nthan a woman called to live out her sincerely held religious \\nbeliefs by creating custom wedding websites is, thankfully, not supported by the history or tradition of the First Amendment \\nand the muscular protections it affords religious believers. \\n 29\\nThis failure is compounded by the Tenth Circuit's \\nfallacy of a marketplace of one for Ms. Smith's \\nspeech. Id. at 1180. Such convenient analysis \\nallowed the court to conclude \\\"there are no less intrusive means of providing equal access to those  \\ntypes of services.\\\" Id. (emphasis added). But this \\nclever reasoning flips this Court's precedent on its \\nhead. Rather than prioritize the religious speaker's \\nobjection in search of a less restrictive means, the \\ncourt below merely concluded that she is the only one and therefore no other means will suffice. But, \\nwhere, as here, the government can achieve its interests without burdening religion, the \\nConstitution requires it to do so. Fulton , 141 S. Ct., \\nat 1881. The analysis is also anomalous in the free speech context because it cannot be that the more \\nunique and distinctive the speech, the less  First \\nAmendment protection it deserves. But that is the staggering breadth of the Tenth Circuit majority's \\nconclusion. See 303 Creative , 6 F.4th, at 1204-05 \\n(Tymkovich, C.J., dissenting).  \\nMoreover, by categorizing Ms. Smith as nothing \\nmore than a \\\"public accommodation,\\\" the Tenth \\nCircuit minimized her right to participate in the \\nmarketplace, even as a woman of faith. See 303 \\nCreative, 6 F.4th, at 1181 (\\\"[W]hether an exception limits market access depends upon the uniqueness of \\nthe public accommodation's goods and services\\u2014not \\nthe sincerity of the public accommodation's beliefs.\\\"). \\nTo deny a benefit to those \\\"who engage in certain \\nforms of speech is in effect to penalize them for such \\nspeech,\\\" and constitutionally, no different than \\nconditioning a benefit on a person's \\\"willingness to \\nviolate a cardinal principle of her religious faith;\\\" the \\n 30\\nresult is the same: to \\\"deter[] or discourage[] the \\nexercise of First Amendment rights of expression.\\\" \\nSherbert , 374 U.S., at 405-06 (citing Speiser v. \\nRandall, 357 U.S. 513, 518 (1958)). Here too, Colorado seeks to impose the same constitutional \\nharm: speak in violation of your core religious faith \\nor lose the benefit of marketplace participation. Put \\nsimply, Colorado seeks to punish Ms. Smith for her \\nsincerely held religious beliefs. See also Trinity \\nLutheran Church , 137 S. Ct., at 2021\\u201322 (finding a \\nconstitutional violation where a burden puts \\nreligious believers \\\"to a choice: [] participate in an \\notherwise available benefit\\\" or maintain your \\nreligious identity). \\nThe same fundamental principle must apply to \\nfree speech and religious practices when they act in concert: \\\"In an open, pluralistic, self-governing \\nsociety, the expression of an idea cannot be \\nsuppressed simply because some find it offensive, \\ninsulting, or even wounding.\\\" Fulton , 141 S. Ct., at \\n1924-25 (Alito, J., concurring). To lose this principle is to lose the \\\"preservation of religious freedom.\\\" Id., \\nat 1925. That is because \\\"[s]uppressing speech\\u2014or \\nreligious practice\\u2014simply because it expresses an idea that some find hurtful is a zero-sum game.\\\" Id. \\nThis Court's jurisprudence confirms this link \\nbetween religious exercise and free speech because \\nthis Court's opinions \\\"make it perfectly clear that \\ndiscrimination against religious, as opposed to \\nsecular, expression is viewpoint discrimination.\\\" \\nNurre v. Whitehead , 559 U.S. 1025, 1028 (2010) \\n(Alito, J., dissenting). And because viewpoint discrimination is \\\"an egregious form of content \\ndiscrimination,\\\" Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of \\n 31\\nthe Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995), it brings \\nwith it heightened constitutional skepticism. \\nAlthough some may find Ms. Smith's religious \\nbeliefs objectionable, \\\"religions, and those who \\nadhere to religious doctrines, may continue to \\nadvocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by \\ndivine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be \\ncondoned.\\\" Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U.S. 644, 679 \\n(2015). \\\"An open society can keep that promise while still respecting the 'dignity,' 'worth,' and fundamental equality of all members of the \\ncommunity.\\\" Fulton , 141 S. Ct., at 1925 (Alito, J., \\nconcurring) (quoting Masterpiece Cakeshop , 138 S. \\nCt., at 1727). Ms. Smith should be free to practice all \\naspects of her faith, without fear of government-\\ncompelled expression against her sincerely held \\nreligious beliefs. The Constitution demands no less. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_content_alt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3958,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"........................................................ 31 \\n \\n       \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\niii \\n \\nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES  \\n \\nCASES  \\n  \\n303 Creative Ltd.

As a non-profit organization, the \\nCatholic League is dedicated to safeguarding the \\nreligious freedom and free speech rights of Catholics \\nwhenever and wherever they are threatened. Both \\nthe letter and spirit of the First Amendment \\nmotivate every aspect of the Catholic League's work defending the right of all Catholics\\u2014lay and clergy \\nalike\\u2014to participate in American public life without \\ndefamation or discrimination. \\nTo advance these efforts, the Catholic League \\nsubmits this brief in support of the Petitioners. \\n  \\n                                           \\n1 Pursuant to Rule 37.3(a), both the Petitioners and the \\nRespondents have provided blanket consents to the filing of \\namicus briefs.

While debating the extent to \\nwhich the Constitution should enshrine protections for religious freedom during the First Congress, \\nRepresentative Daniel Carroll of Maryland\\u2014one of \\nthe few Catholics among the Constitution's \\nFramers\\u2014remarked \\\"the rights of conscience are, in \\ntheir nature, of peculiar delicacy, and will little bear \\nthe gentlest touch of governmental hand.\\\" 1 Annals \\nof Cong. 757-58 (Joseph Gales ed., 1834) (Aug. 15, 1789). \\nNowhere are the rights of the religious more \\ndelicate than when they intersect with the freedom \\nto put faith into action, belief into words. If the \\nrobust religious freedom protections guaranteed by \\nour Constitution are to have any meaning, they must \\nbe capable of shielding a sincere religious believer from being coerced into speaking against the core \\ntenants of her faith. To hold otherwise would be to \\npermit the heavy hand of government to extinguish \\nreligious practice. This the Constitution will not \\nallow. \\nThe Founders understood that the First \\nAmendment, as drafted, protected all religious sects in their right to speak freely in accordance with their \\nfaith. Indeed, the Founding Generation believed \\nprotections for religious lib erty to be of utmost \\nimport. Since its founding, America has been gripped \\n 3 \\nin debate over religious liberty. Even before the \\ncolonies declared their independence, there were \\nenergetic discussions over the bounds of religious \\ntoleration versus a full freedom to exercise religion \\n(with only limited exceptions). Ultimately, the \\nConstitution's drafters settled on James Madison's \\nview of an unalienable right to practice one's \\nreligious faith. Owed to an understanding that the Governor of the Universe supersedes any earthly \\nauthority, religious convictions were understood to \\ncommand greater deference than mere personal \\nopinions. Where opinion was required to yield to the \\nlaw, tensions between law and religious belief often \\nresulted in exemption for the believer. \\nThe Founding Generation also viewed religious \\nliberty as encompassing more  than mere matters of \\nconscience or decisions on the rightness or wrongness \\nof acts. Instead, the full ex ercise of religion offered a \\nright to act in accordance with one's faith and, \\nnecessarily, included protection from government \\ncompelled speech that violated a believer's firmly \\nheld religious convictions. This distinction was \\nperhaps most clearly expressed in the early colonies' \\nanti-Catholic prejudices. In colonial Georgia, for example, while all worshipers were vested by its \\nCharter with a liberty of conscience, Catholics were \\nexpressly excluded from protections for the more \\nrobust free exercise of religion. McConnell, The \\nOrigins and Historical Understanding of Free \\nExercise of Religion, 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1409, 1489-90 \\n(1989) (hereinafter McConnell, Origins). \\nInformed by the debates and experiences of their \\ntime, the Founders opted to include among the Constitution's protections the more extensive free \\n 4 \\nexercise of religion. In so doing, they extended the \\nmaximum protections available to all who professed \\nbelief in a Universal Sovereign. These protections, it \\nwas understood, included a right to act out belief and \\nto speak, or refrain from speaking, freely, in \\naccordance with faith. \\nWith this understanding as background, it is \\nclear the First Amendment provides dual protections for religious expression (or non-expression) in its \\nguarantees of free speech and free religious exercise. \\nThis reality compels the conclusion that religious \\nspeech enjoys the highest constitutional protection. \\nCertainly, this is consistent with the Founders' \\nunderstanding of robust religious liberty protections, \\nas revealed in the text, history, and tradition of the First Amendment. \\nThis Court's recent religious liberty jurisprudence \\nconcurs with the Founders' view of full-throated \\nreligious liberty protection. Religious observers have \\nwelcomed the relief from government oppression. No \\nlonger can religious believers be excluded solely \\nbecause of their religious identity. Free are the religious to express their religious views without fear \\nof government reprisal. This Court's precedents have \\nbeen unequivocal: if government can achieve its \\nmeans without burdening religion, the Constitution \\nalmost always requires that it must. \\nAnother truism is derived from this Court's \\nprecedents. When religious liberty concerns are coupled with free expression, the Constitution \\ndemands the most exacting scrutiny. That is because \\nthe First Amendment, as understood from the \\nFounding, provides special protection for the \\n 5 \\nreligious, their right to speak freely, and their right \\nto refrain from speaking. Distinct from pure \\ncommercial speech, religious speech demands a \\nhigher constitutional protection. That is why, to \\nAmicus Curiae's knowledge, government compelled \\nreligious speech has never been held to survive strict \\nscrutiny. \\nAgainst this backdrop, the Tenth Circuit's opinion \\ncannot stand. Although purporting to apply strict scrutiny, the Tenth Circuit's analysis is rife with \\nflaws, each one fatal to the court's conclusion. From \\nthe outset, the Tenth Circuit failed to recognize the \\npreferred status of Ms. Smith's free speech rights, \\ngrounded as they are in her religious beliefs. This \\nfailure is only compounded by the Tenth Circuit's lethargic narrow-tailoring analysis. Far from the \\nexacting analysis this Court requires, the Tenth \\nCircuit settles into a now familiar pattern to those of \\nfaith\\u2014ostracizing Ms. Smith from society because of \\nher religious identity. \\nOnce again, this Court must reverse yet another \\nassault on religious freedom by declaring that where, as here, free speech and religion intersect, \\nconstitutional protections are at their greatest. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 6 \\nARGUMENT \\nI. AS ORIGINALLY UNDERSTOOD , THE FIRST \\nAMENDMENT PROTECTED THE RIGHT OF THE \\nRELIGIOUS TO SPEAK AND TO REMAIN SILENT . \\nThe First Amendment is \\\"unique in form among \\namendments to the Constitution.\\\"2 It is drafted, not \\nas a grant of privileges or rights to the people, but as \\na disability on Congress' ability to act. Report to the Attorney General, supra  note 2, at 15\\u201316. In its \\nentirety, the First Amendment reads: \\nCongress shall make no law respecting \\nan establishment of religion, or \\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; or \\nabridging the freedom of speech, or of \\nthe press; or the right of the people \\npeaceably to assemble, and to petition \\nthe Government for a redress of grievances.  \\nU.S.\\n Const., Amdt. 1. \\nIn barring certain kinds of laws, the First \\nAmendment recognizes a pre-existing \\\"immun[ity] from such legislative action.\\\" Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral, supra note 2, at 16. This reflects an \\nunderstanding by the Founding Generation that these \\\"are pre-existent rights\\u2014inalienable rights\\u2014\\n                                           \\n2 O f f i c e  o f  L e g a l  P o l i c y ,  D e p t  o f  J u s t i c e ,  R e p o r t  t o  t h e  \\nAttorney General: Religious Li berty Under the Free Exercise \\nClause at 15 (1986) (hereinafter Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral). \\n 7 \\nand not mere civil privileges conferred by a \\nbenevolent sovereign.\\\" Id. \\nTaken together, the text, history, and philosophy \\nof the First Amendment establish the principle that \\n\\\"the government has no right to interfere with the \\nfree exercise of religion\\\" unless the \\\"government \\naction is necessary to prevent manifest danger to the \\nexistence of the state; to protect public peace, safety, \\nand order; or to secure the religious liberty of \\nothers.\\\" Id., at v. And, even then, only if the \\ngovernment deploys \\\"the least restrictive means \\nnecessary to protect these interests.\\\" Id. This is true \\nas a matter of the First Amendment's Religious Liberty Clauses. And because freedom of religion \\ncannot be divorced from freedom of expression, it is \\neven more true when the government tries to force a \\nbeliever to speak in a way that cannot be reconciled \\nwith her religious convictions. \\nA. Religious liberty was profoundly \\nimportant to the Founding Generation; \\nreligious convictions were understood \\nto receive greater deference than mere \\npersonal opinion. \\n1. The Founding Generation was uniquely \\nattuned to issues regarding the proper relationship \\nbetween religion and government. Indeed, at the time of America's founding there was \\\"an intense and \\ncontroversial theoretical debate\\\" of these issues \\ninvolving \\\"[m]ost of the great political thinkers of the \\nperiod.\\\" McConnell, Origins, at 1430. These thinkers \\ninformed the Founders' own debates on the issue and \\nundoubtedly \\\"influenced the American solution to \\nthe problem.\\\" Id.  \\n 8 \\nJohn Locke, perhaps more than any other \\nphilosopher who contributed to the ideas \\nunderpinning America's founding, provided the \\n\\\"most extensive\\\" discussion of religion and most \\ndirectly influenced the Framers' drafting of the First \\nAmendment. Id. Locke was an early and influential \\ntheoretical thinker and advocate for religious freedom. Id., at 1431. In his view \\\"religious rivalry \\nand intolerance\\\" were \\\"among the most important of political problems,\\\" and \\\"[r]eligious intolerance was inconsistent both with public peace and with good \\ngovernment.\\\" Id. \\nLocke's solution, however, was an \\\"understanding \\nof religious toleration,\\\" that \\\"expressly precludes free \\nexercise exemptions.\\\" Id., at 1435. To Locke, when \\n\\\"individual conscience conflicts with the governmental policy, the government will always \\nprevail and the individual will always be forced to \\nsubmit or suffer the punishment.\\\" Id. Locke's \\ninfluence on the drafters of the First Amendment makes it all the more remarkable that his view did \\nnot triumph with America's founding. \\nThe American Revolution upended the \\npreexisting relationship between religion and government, especially in states where the Anglican \\nChurch had the most influence. Id., at 1436. \\n\\\"America was in the wake of a great religious \\nrevival,\\\" that brought with it a \\\"drive for religious \\nfreedom.\\\" Id., at 1437\\u201338. Along with this drive came \\na push from \\\"religious supporters of disestablishment and free exercise\\\" to enshrine \\n\\\"constitutional protections\\\" for religious freedoms \\\"at the federal level.\\\" Id., at 1440. \\n 9 \\nThis movement was encapsulated in debate \\nsurrounding the religious liberty clause in Virginia's \\n1776 Bill of Rights. When George Mason proposed \\nusing the Lockean phrase \\\"toleration of religion,\\\" \\nJames Madison objected, complaining that the \\nphrase implied an act of legislative grace (which, to \\nLocke, it did). Id. , at 1443. Madison was not alone \\namong the Founding Generation in rejecting this concept. George Washin gton and Thomas Paine \\nsimilarly eschewed \\\"toleration,\\\" decrying its \\nimplication of government \\\"indulgence\\\" rather than a \\nfundamental, preexisting right. Id., at 1443\\u201344. \\nMoreover, Madison objected to Mason's proposal \\nbecause it excepted from even the \\\"toleration\\\" of \\nreligious freedom any instance where \\\"under color of \\nreligion any man disturb the peace, the happiness, or \\nsafety of society.\\\" See G. Hunt, James Madison and \\nReligious Liberty, 1 Ann. Rep. Am. Hist. A. 163, 166 \\n(1901). It was Madison's belief that such phrasing \\n\\\"might easily be so twisted as to oppress religious \\nsects under the excuse that they disturbed 'the \\npeace, the happiness, or safety of society.'\\\" Id. \\nMadison's objections were heard by Virginia's \\nassembly. As adopted, Virginia's Bill of Rights \\npromised that all \\\"are equally entitled to the free \\nexercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience,\\\" and reminded only \\\"that\\n it is the mutual \\nduty of all to practice Christian forbearance, love, and charity towards each other.\\\" Report to the \\nAttorney General, supra  note 2, at 102\\u201303. \\n2. This early debate between Madison and Mason \\nbears witness to what this Court has long noted\\u2014\\nthat Madison was \\\"the leading architect of the \\n 10\\nreligion clauses of the First Amendment.\\\" Hosanna-\\nTabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v. \\nEEOC , 565 U.S. 171, 184 (2012) (internal quotation \\nmarks omitted). Madison's rejection of religious \\ntolerance in favor of full and free religious expression permeates his Memorial and Remonstrance . \\nExplaining that \\\"[t]he Religion then of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every \\nman,\\\" Madison understood that it is not just \\\"the \\nright of every man to exercise it as these may \\ndictate,\\\" but further \\\"the duty of every man to render \\nto the Creator such homage, and such only, as he \\nbelieves to be acceptable to him.\\\" J. Madison, \\nMemorial and Remonstrance \\u00a7 1 (1785), reprinted in \\nEverson v. Bd. of Educ. , 330 U.S. 1, 64 (1947). This \\nright, Madison admonished, \\\"is in its nature an unalienable right.\\\" Id. \\nMadison expounded his view that \\\"[t]his duty is \\nprecedent both in order of time and degree of \\nobligation, to the claims of Civil Society.\\\" Id. Before \\nanyone is \\\"a member of Civil Society,\\\" they are \\\"considered as a subject of the Governor of the \\nUniverse.\\\" Id. For this reason, \\\"in matters of \\nReligion, no man's right is abridged by the institution of Civil Society.\\\" Id. But Madison went \\nfurther. \\\"[I]f religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that \\nof the Legislative Body.\\\" Id., at \\u00a7 2, reprinted in \\nEverson , 330 U.S., at 65. Legislators who \\n\\\"encroach[]\\\" on the rights of the people, Madison \\nsaid, \\\"exceed the commission from which they derive their authority, and are Tyrants.\\\" Id. \\nRecognizing that Madison's Memorial and \\nRemonstrance is not law, see City of Boerne v. Flores , \\n 11\\n521 U.S. 507, 541 (1997) (Scalia, J., concurring), it \\nnonetheless offers a clear understanding of why the \\nFounding Generation thought it so crucial to \\nmemorialize the inalienable freedom of religion in \\nthe First Amendment. And Madison's defense of the \\nAmerican conception of religious liberty merely \\nechoed the prevalent thought at the founding \\\"of the \\ndifference between religious faith and other forms of human judgment.\\\" McConnell, Origins, at 1496. \\nAt the Founding, the prevailing view was that the \\n\\\"opinions of individuals\\\" can not take \\\"precedence \\nover the decisions of civil society.\\\" Id. The same was \\nnot true for religious convictions. \\\"Conflicts arising from religious convictions were conceived not as a \\nclash between the judgment of the individual and of \\nthe state, but as a conflict between earthly and \\nspiritual sovereigns.\\\" Id. In those instances, the \\nperson holding the religious conviction \\\"was not seen as the instigator of the conflict; the believer was simply caught between the inconsistent demands of \\ntwo rightful authorities, through no fault of his own.\\\" \\nId. This view is essential to understanding the \\nFounders' belief that \\\"freedom of religion is unalienable because it is a duty to God and not a \\nprivilege of the individual.\\\" Id., at 1497. \\n3. Bolstering this understanding, the historical \\nrecord surrounding adoption of the Bill of Rights \\nsuggests that the First Amendment's use of the term \\\"religion\\\" was a deliberate choice. See McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1488. Although \\\"[t]he recorded debates \\nin\\\" both chambers of Congress \\\"cast little light on the \\nmeaning of the free exercise clause,\\\" looking at \\nsuccessive drafts of the clause from its consideration \\nand debate in the First Congress are especially \\n 12\\nenlightening. Id., at 1481, 1483. While earlier drafts \\nof the First Amendment used the phrase \\\"rights of \\nconscience,\\\" the final version that emerged enshrined in the First Amendment a protection for the \\\"free \\nexercise of religion.\\\" Id., at 1488. This phrasing lends \\nfurther support to the Founders' understanding of religious freedoms. \\nTo the Founders, \\\"[b]elief in a Supreme Being \\nwas\\\" essential to \\\"religion.\\\" Report to the Attorney \\nGeneral, supra  note 2, at 9. Indeed, \\\"[t]he historical \\nmaterials uniformly equate 'religion' with belief in God or in gods.\\\" McConnell, Origins, at 1493. These references \\\"can be extended without distortion to \\ntranscendent extrapersonal authorities not \\nenvisioned in traditionally theistic terms\\\"\\u2014for \\nexample, Madison's use of \\\"Creator,\\\" \\\"Governor of \\nthe Universe,\\\" and \\\"Universal Sovereign,\\\" imply \\\"an attempt at a definition more compendious than the \\nfamiliar Judeo-Christian God, but it retains the distinction between transcendent authority and \\npersonal judgment.\\\" Id.  \\nReligion, as understood by the Founders and \\nexpressed in the First Amendment, then, is best \\ndefined to encompass \\\"a system of beliefs, whether \\npersonally or institutionally held, prompted by the \\nacceptance of transcendent realities or \\nacknowledging extratemporal actions.\\\" Report to the \\nAttorney General, supra note 2, at 26\\u201327. This \\ninterpretation of religion is both accurate to the Founders' understanding and consistent with their view that religion encompasses \\\"duties that were \\nbeyond the jurisdiction of the state either to \\nprescribe or to proscribe.\\\" Id., at 9. To the Founders, \\nreligion encompassed a subservience to a \\n 13\\n\\\"transcendent reality,\\\" which if abandoned could \\nunleash \\\"extratemporal consequences.\\\" Id., at 29. \\nThis explains their motivation to preserve a robust freedom from government \\\"interfere[nce] with such \\nbeliefs or duties.\\\" Id. \\nB. The Founding Generation's understanding of religious liberty \\nencompassed protection for believers \\nfrom compelled speech that violates \\nfirmly held religious beliefs. \\n1. The least controversial point about the phrase \\n\\\"free exercise\\\" is that \\\"by definition, the words denote action or activity.\\\" Id., at 19. To the Founders, \\nreligious liberty undoubtedly included \\\"religiously motivated conduct  as well as belief.\\\" McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1488 (emphasis added). This point bears emphasis because of this Court's history rejecting \\nsuch a reading. See  Reynolds v. United States , 98 \\nU.S. 145, 164 (1878); but see Fulton v. City of Phila. , \\n141 S. Ct. 1868, 1913 (2021) (Alito, J., concurring) \\n(noting \\\"[t]he Court ha[s] repudiated that distinction\\\" in Reynolds  \\\"that the Free Exercise \\nClause protects beliefs, not conduct\\\"). \\nIn substituting the \\\"rights of conscience\\\" in favor \\nof a protection for the \\\"free exercise of religion,\\\" the \\nFramer's chose a phrase that \\\"strongly connoted \\naction,\\\" in place of one that suggested mere opinion \\nor belief. McConnell, Origins, at 1489. Leading \\ndictionaries of that era defined \\\"exercise\\\" to include \\n\\\"[l]abour of the body,\\\" \\\"[t]ask; that which one is \\nappointed to perform,\\\" \\\"[a]ct of divine worship, \\nwhether public or private,\\\" or \\\"[t]o use or practice.\\\" See id.  (collecting dictionary definitions). Conscience, \\n 14\\non the other hand, was more likely to imply a \\n\\\"natural knowledge, or the faculty that decides on \\nthe right or wrong of actions.\\\" Id. (quoting N. \\nWebster, A Dictionary of The English Language 301 (New Haven 1807)). \\nParticularly instructive on this distinction is the \\nGeorgia Charter of 1732. The Charter included \\\"a \\nliberty of conscience allowe d in the worship of God, \\nto all persons,\\\" but reserved the more exclusive right to \\\"a free exercise of religion,\\\" only to \\\"all such persons, except papists.\\\" Id., at 1489\\u201390. By granting \\nCatholics only a liberty of conscience, but not the free exercise of religion, the Georgia Charter necessarily \\nreserved a fuller right to non-Catholic worshipers. \\nOne scholar has observed that \\\"[t]he most plausible \\nreading of the provision is that it permitted Catholics \\nto believe what they wished . . . but did not permit \\nthem to put their faith into action.\\\" Id., at 1490. \\nBy including a full and robust \\\"free exercise of \\nreligion\\\" within the First Amendment, the Founders understood that they were protecting not only the \\nright for the religious to believe what their faith \\ntaught, but to put those beliefs into action. To \\nconclude otherwise would be to \\\"trivialize the idea of \\nreligion by separating thought from life, faith from \\nworks.\\\" Report to the Attorney General, supra note \\n2, at 31. Possessing \\\"a right to believe something in one's mind without the freedom to utter it, advocate it, or even translate it into life,\\\" is hardly a \\nsubstantive freedom at all. Id., at 31\\u201332. \\n2. Consistent with the Founders' understanding \\nof a robust religious liberty protection that included \\nthe right to act out your faith was the axiom that \\n 15\\naction naturally includes expression or the freedom \\nto refrain from expression that conflicts with belief. \\nAlthough early religious liberty controversies were \\nrelatively limited, the historical record includes \\nexamples of protections for religious exercise \\nintertwined with such expressive activity. \\nAn early source of common conflict, for example, \\narose around the issue of oath requirements. Oaths \\nserved as \\\"the principal means of ensuring honest \\ntestimony and solemnizing obligations.\\\" McConnell, \\nOrigins, at 1467. But many early religious sects \\nrefused to take an oath, believing it was in conflict \\nwith the teachings of the New Testament.3 Id. \\nBecause oaths were required before court testimony, this refusal often left these sincere religious objectors \\nwithout access to the court system. Id. \\nIn response, many of the early colonies adopted \\nalternatives, allowing relig ious dissenters to take a \\npledge or make an affirmation rather than to swear \\nan oath. Id., at 1467\\u201368 (\\\"By 1789, virtually all of the \\nstates had enacted oath exemptions.\\\"). This simple solution permitted religious sects access to the court \\nsystem, without requiring them to act out of step \\n                                           \\n3 See Matthew 5:33-37 (\\\"Again, ye have heard that it hath \\nbeen said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, \\nbut shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: But I say unto you, \\nSwear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: Nor \\nby the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is \\nthe city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy \\nhead, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever \\nis more than these cometh of evil.\\\"). \\n 16\\nwith their religious beliefs or to make an expression \\nthey found incompatible with their faith. \\nA still more extreme example of laws yielding to \\nexpressive activities of religious sects in the \\nFounding Generation can be found in colonial \\nGeorgia. There, the Trus tees of Georgia granted \\ncertain groups of religious refugees a general exemption from the laws that allowed them \\\"to organize themselves in accordance with their own \\nfaith.\\\" Id., at 1471. One historia n described one such \\ngroup from Salzburg\\u2014which formed the town of Ebenezer\\u2014as \\\"a state within a state, a sort of \\ntheocracy under the direction of their minsters with \\ndaily conferences of the entire congregation in which \\nGod's guidance was invoked at the beginning and the \\nend.\\\" Id. Although these groups where required to \\nobey certain colonial laws pertaining to military service, property, and good governance, they were \\n\\\"otherwise free to govern themselves.\\\" Id. at 1471 \\nn.312 \\nAnother founding era example of religious \\nexemptions for expressive action appeared in North \\nCarolina and Maryland. There, laws exempted \\nmembers of certain religious sects from a \\nrequirement to remove their hat in court. Id. The \\nreligious objectors viewed such an action as \\\"a form of obeisance to secular authority forbidden by their \\nreligion.\\\" Id., at 1472. Rather than forcing members \\nof these sects to choose be tween access to the courts \\nor expressing themselves in violation of their religious beliefs, states offered an exemption. \\nWhile this example may seem trivial by today's \\nstandards, it was very mu ch on the minds of the \\n 17\\nFounding Generation. At the time, \\\"[o]ne of the most \\nnotorious courtroom cases of religious intolerance in \\nEngland involved William Penn's refusal to remove \\nhis hat when he appeared in court\\\" to face \\nindictment for speaking to  an unlawful assembly. Id. \\nWhen Penn refused to remove a court-furnished hat from his head in respect to the court, he was held in \\ncontempt and imprisoned. Id. This case attracted \\nsignificant attention in America, and undoubtedly influenced the exemptions passed in North Carolina and Maryland. Id. \\nIndeed, the importance of this exemption was \\ndemonstrated in debates over the Bill of Rights in \\nthe First Congress. Id., at 1472, n.320. In ridiculing \\nthe list of freedoms proposed to be protected, Theodore Sedgwick of Mass achusetts remarked \\\"they \\nmight have declared that a man should have a right to wear his hat if he pleased . . . but he would ask the \\ngentleman whether he thought it necessary to enter \\nthese trifles in a declaration of rights.\\\" Id. (citation \\nomitted). With unmistakable reference to the Penn case, John Page of Virginia replied: \\nThe gentleman from \\nMassachusetts . . . objects to the clause, \\nbecause the right is of so trivial a \\nnature. He supposes it no more \\nessential than whether a man has a \\nright to wear his hat or not; but let me \\nobserve to him that such rights have \\nbeen opposed, and a man has been obliged to pull off his hat when he \\nappeared before the face of authority; \\npeople have also been prevented from \\n 18\\nassembling together on their lawful \\noccasions.  \\nId. (citation omitted). Certainly, the Founders were \\nacutely aware of the potential for abuse by \\nauthorities absent a robust religious liberty \\nprotection that clearly extended to actions, including \\nreligiously motivated expression or non-expression. \\n3. Taken together, the Free Exercise Clause and \\nthe Free Speech Clause elevate the freedom not to \\nspeak out of accordance with firmly held religious beliefs to the highest echelon of First Amendment \\nprotection. This conclusion is buttressed by the First \\nAmendment's other guarantees\\u2014e.g., freedom of \\nassembly and freedom to petition the government. If \\nthe Free Exercise Clause conferred nothing more \\nthan a \\\"right to express religious beliefs,\\\" it would \\n\\\"add nothing to the First Amendment, since that right is fully protected by the right to assemble, \\nspeak, and publish.\\\" Report to the Attorney General, \\nsupra note 2, at 19. Indeed, \\\"because religious \\nexpression is doubly protected by the constitutional \\ntext\\\" it would make little sense if it were \\\"less \\nprotected in practice.\\\" Id. , at 19, n.30. \\nThe examples cited above represent a clear \\nunderstanding by the Founding Generation that civil \\nlaws, even of general applicability, must yield when they conflict with religious expression or the freedom \\nto refrain from expression on the basis of a sincerely \\nheld religious belief. As it seems early legislative \\nbodies believed exemptions in such cases were \\nrequired by the principle of free exercise, it stands to \\nreason that the Framers understood \\\"similar \\napplications of the principle\\\" would guide the courts \\n 19\\nin these cases, once \\\"entrusted with the \\nresponsibility of enforcing\\\" First Amendment \\nguarantees. McConnell, Origins, at 1473. \\nAlthough there was a dearth of litigation over \\nreligious liberty protections in the early years of the \\nRepublic, what scarce examples exist support this \\nview. Consider, for example, the earliest state court \\nopinion addressing the issue of a religious liberty exemption, People v. Phillips . In that case, the court \\nheld that the New York Constitution protected a Catholic priest from compulsory testimony to \\nmatters learned while administering the Sacrament \\nof Confession. See  id., at 1504. \\nImportant to the Phillips court was the notion \\nthat requiring testimony from the priest to \\\"what he \\nreceives in confession, is to declare that there shall \\nbe no penance; and this important branch of the Roman Catholic religion would be thus annihilated.\\\" \\nId. (citation omitted). The court did not believe it was \\ncompatible with religious liberty to compel expression that would so eviscerate a core belief of Catholic faith. Rather than establishing a special \\nprivilege for adherents to the Catholic faith, though, \\nthe court viewed its actions as necessary to ensure \\nCatholics received the same  treatment as Protestants \\n(the dominant faith at the time) in the administration of their sacraments. Id., at 1504-05. \\nThe through line to the Founding Generation's \\nunderstanding of religious liberty was a belief that \\nsuch freedom was without substantive meaning if it did not encompass expression, and non-expression, \\nrooted in religious belief. Noted Nineteenth Century \\n 20\\nConstitutional commentator, Michigan Supreme \\nCourt Justice Thomas Cooley, explained: \\nAn earnest believer usually regards it as his duty to propagate his opinions, \\nand to bring others to his views. To \\ndeprive him of this right is to take from \\nhim the power to perform what he \\nconsiders a most sacred obligation.  \\nT. Cooley, A Treatise on the Constitutional \\nLimitations 665 (7th ed. 1903). Put another way: \\nreligious freedom, as understood by the Founders, \\nnecessarily encompasses the freedom to put belief \\ninto action, to engage in expression consistent with \\nthe dogmas of your faith, and to refrain from \\nexpression that may engender extratemporal consequences. \\nII. T\\nHIS COURT 'S PRECEDENTS \\u2014ESPECIALLY ITS \\nDEMANDING APPLICATION OF THE LEAST -\\nRESTRICTIVE MEANS TEST \\u2014DEMONSTRATE \\nAGREEMENT WITH THE FOUNDING GENERATION 'S \\nROBUST RELIGIOUS LIBERTY PROTECTIONS . \\nThis Court has a commendable history of \\nrecognizing the principles discussed above. In \\nparticular, the Court's recent religious liberty \\njurisprudence has been a welcome reprieve for \\nmembers of all faith communities who have been disheartened by the antagonism of some government \\nactors. See,  e.g., Espinoza v. Mont. Dept of Revenue , \\n140 S. Ct. 2246 (2020); Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. \\nColo. Civil Rights Comm'n , 138 S. Ct. 1719 (2018); \\nHosanna-Tabor , 565 U.S. 171. \\n 21\\nOf particular note is the Court's insistence on a \\nforceful application of the strict scrutiny test to any \\nrestriction that burdens religious liberty. Indeed, \\\"in \\nthis highly sensitive constitutional area, 'only the \\ngravest abuses, endangering paramount interests, \\ngive occasion for permissible limitation.'\\\" Sherbert v. \\nVerner , 374 U.S. 398, 406 (1963) (quoting Thomas v. \\nCollins, 323 U.S. 516, 530 (1945)). \\n1. A few examples illustrate the point. Consider \\nBurwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. , where this \\nCourt considered a government-imposed contraceptive mandate on private employers who \\nbelieved such a requirement to be against their \\nreligious beliefs. 573 U.S. 682, 726 (2014).\\n4 While \\nassuming, without deciding, that the government's \\ninterest was compelling, the Court nonetheless found \\nthat the least-restrictive-means standard was not \\nmet. Id., at 728. Identifying alternative solutions to \\nthe rigid mandate imposed by the government, the Court explained, \\\"[t]he least-restrictive-means \\nstandard is exceptionally demanding.\\\" Id.  As Justice \\nKennedy explained, religious freedom \\\"implicates more than just freedom of belief\\\"; rather \\\"[i]t means, too, the right to express those beliefs and to establish \\none's religious (or nonreligious) self-definition in the \\npolitical, civic, and econ omic life of our larger \\n                                           \\n4 Hobby Lobby  was decided under the Religious Freedom \\nRestoration Act of 1993 (\\\"RFRA\\\"), which requires as an initial \\nmatter finding a substantial government burden on the exercise of religion; if such a burden exists, the Court must determine \\nwhether there is a compelling governmental interest and that \\nthe burden is the least restrictive means of furthering that \\ninterest. Hobby Lobby , 573 U.S., at 694-95. \\n 22\\ncommunity.\\\" Id., at 736\\u201337 (Kennedy, J., \\nconcurring). \\nIn another instance, this Court found Missouri \\nviolated a church's religious  liberty guarantees under \\nthe First Amendment when it categorically denied \\ntheir participation in a grant program for playground \\nsurface materials. Trinity Lutheran Church of \\nColumbia, Inc. v. Comer , 137 S. Ct. 2012, 2017, 2025 \\n(2017). Finding that otherwise eligible grant \\nrecipients were disqualified solely because of their \\nreligious nature, this Court held that such a penalty \\nworked against the free exercise of religion and \\\"triggers the most exacting scrutiny.\\\" Id., at 2021. \\nImportantly, the harm was not the denial of the grant itself but instead was Missouri's refusal to \\neven allow the church to compete with secular \\norganizations for grant funds solely on the basis of \\nits religious identity. Id., at 2022. \\nMore recently still, this Court took up the mantle \\nof religious liberties in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia . \\nDespite the Catholic Church's over two centuries of dedication to serving the needy children of \\nPhiladelphia, the City in 2018 stopped referring foster children to the Catholic Social Services (\\\"CSS\\\") \\nafter learning the organization would not \\\"consider \\nprospective foster parents in same-sex marriages.\\\" \\nFulton , 141 S. Ct., at 1874\\u201375. Finding that \\\"it is \\nplain\\\" the City burdens CSS's \\\"religious exercise by putting it to the choice of  curtailing its mission or \\napproving relationships inconsistent with its beliefs,\\\" this Court sought a review of whether such burden \\nwas \\\"constitutionally permissible.\\\" Id., at 1876. In \\ndetermining that Philadelphia imposed an unconstitutional burden on CSS's religious exercise, \\n 23\\nFulton  admonishes that \\\"so lo ng as the government \\ncan achieve its interests in a manner that does not \\nburden religion, it must do so.\\\" Id., at 1881. \\nTaken together, the precedents of this Court \\nestablish that an exacting analysis is required in \\nreligious liberty cases to determine whether the \\ngovernment's interest is compelling, and its burden \\nnarrowly tailored to achieve that interest. The \\nexistence of an alternative means for achieving even \\na compelling interest is nearly always fatal to the government's argument.  \\n2. When religious liberty and free expression \\nconcerns intertwine, this Court has been even less \\nhesitant to invalidate an infringing law. This \\nskepticism is warranted, as attempts to compel \\nexpression that conflicts with an individual's \\nreligious beliefs are nothing more than indirect \\nattempts to regulate religion itself. \\nIn 1943, this Court took issue with a West \\nVirginia law mandating a flag salute and pledge, when its application was challenged by a group of \\nJehovah's Witnesses who said such action violated \\ntheir religious beliefs. W. Va. State Bd. Of Educ. V. \\nBarnette , 319 U.S. 624 (1943). Refusing to find that \\n\\\"a Bill of Rights which guards the individual's right \\nto speak his own mind, left it open to public \\nauthorities to compel him to utter what is not on his \\nmind,\\\" the Barnette  Court blocked the law's \\nenforcement. Id. , at 634; see also  id., at 645 (Murphy, \\nJ., concurring) (recognizing \\\"[t]he right of freedom of thought and of religion as guaranteed by the \\nConstitution against State action includes both the \\nright to speak freely and the right to refrain from \\n 24\\nspeaking at all\\\"). Underlying the Court's opinion was \\nthe belief that \\\"[i]f there is any fixed star in our \\nconstitutional constellation, it is that no official, high \\nor petty, can prescribe what  shall be orthodox in \\npolitics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act \\ntheir faith therein.\\\" Id., at 642. \\nExpanding on the holding in Barnette , the Court \\nin Wooley v. Maynard  considered a religious \\nobjection to display of the New Hampshire state motto\\u2014\\\"Live Free or Die\\\"\\u2014on the license plate of a \\ncar owned by Jehovah's Witness. 430 U.S. 705 (1977). In Wooley , the Court expressly rejected the \\nidea that \\\"the State may constitutionally require an individual to participate in the dissemination of an \\nideological message by displaying it on his private \\nproperty.\\\" Id., at 713. \\nFoundational to its decision was the Court's \\nholding that the freedoms contained within the First \\nAmendment \\\"includes both the right to speak freely \\nand the right to refrain from speaking at all.\\\" Id., at \\n714. It matters not whether most agree with the message the State seeks to force a person to convey; the First Amendment unquestionably \\\"protects the \\nright of individuals to hold a point of view different \\nfrom the majority and to refu se to foster . . . an idea \\nthey find morally objectionable.\\\" Id. , at 715. Finding \\nthe existence of a governmental burden, the Court \\nwas left to question whether a substantial \\ngovernmental interest existed and, if so, whether the \\nburden was narrowly tailored to advance that \\ninterest. Even assuming a legitimate and substantial interest, the Court concluded \\\"that purpose cannot \\nbe pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental \\n 25\\npersonal liberties when the end can be more \\nnarrowly achieved.\\\" Id., at 716. New Hampshire \\nfailed that test. \\nIn still another line of cases, this Court found \\nthat it violated Constitutional protections to subject religious observants, who went door to door \\ndistributing religious materials and soliciting for the \\npurchase of religious books, to a government \\nsolicitation registration requirement. Murdock v. \\nPennsylvania, 319 U.S. 105 (1943); see also Follett v. \\nTown of McCormick , 321 U.S. 573 (1944). \\nAcknowledging that the practice was derived from the believer's understanding that he was \\\"obeying a \\ncommandment of God,\\\" the Court found that the First Amendment prohibited the imposition of a \\ngenerally applicable registration requirement to \\nengage in such conduct. Murdock , 319 U.S., at 108, \\n117. Indeed, the Court went out of its way to describe the literature being distributed as \\\"provocative, \\nabusive, and ill-mannered.\\\" Id., at 115\\u201316. \\nNevertheless, \\\"[p]lainly  a community may not \\nsuppress . . . the dissemination of views because they \\nare unpopular, annoying or distasteful.\\\" Id.,  at 116 \\nTo allow otherwise would \\\"be a complete repudiation of the philosophy of the Bill of Rights.\\\" Id. \\nThe Court went further still , establishing that the \\nmere fact the religious materials were being \\\"sold\\\" was not enough to transform \\\"evangelism into a \\ncommercial enterprise.\\\" Id., at 111. As such, the \\nCourt acknowledged heightened constitutional protections for \\\"those spreading their religious \\nbeliefs through the spoken and printed word.\\\" Id. As \\ncompared to purely commercial activity, \\\"[f]reedom of \\n 26\\npress, freedom of speech, fr eedom of religion are in a \\npreferred position.\\\" Id., at 115. \\nEven Employment Division v. Smith , often \\ncriticized as having watered down constitutional \\nreligious liberty protections, recognized the Court's \\nunique hostility toward burdens that implicate both \\nthe free exercise of religion and the freedom of \\nspeech. The \\\"First Amendment bars application of a \\nneutral, generally applicable law to religiously \\nmotivated action\\\" when that action \\\"involve[s] not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but the Free \\nExercise Clause in conjunction with other \\nconstitutional protections, such as freedom of \\nspeech.\\\" Empl. Div. v. Smith , 494 U.S. 872, 881\\u201382 \\n(1990). Even some preceden ts, decided on free speech \\ngrounds alone, were undoubtedly reinforced by \\ntouches of freedom-of-religion concerns. Id. \\n3. This much is clear: the arc of this Court's \\nprecedent bends in one incontrovertible direction. \\nScrutiny of any government burden is at its zenith \\nwhen the burden effects an individual's exercise of their religious beliefs in a manner that implicates \\nfree speech protections. This conclusion, rooted in the \\nhistory and tradition of religious exercise as \\nunderstood by the Founders and enshrined in the \\nFirst Amendment, demands that any such burden be \\nsubjected to the most rigorous application of strict \\nscrutiny analysis. \\nIt is precisely for this reason that, to the best of \\nAmicus Curiae's knowledge, the Court has never \\nissued an opinion finding that governmentally \\ncompelled religious speech satisfies strict scrutiny. \\nSee 303 Creative Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Elenis , 6 F.4th \\n 27\\n1160, 1191 (U.S. 10th Cir. 2021) (Tymkovich, C.J., \\ndissenting) (\\\"[T]he majority takes the remarkable\\u2014\\nand novel\\u2014stance that the government may force \\nMs. Smith to produce messages that violate her \\nconscience. . . . No case has ever gone so far.\\\"). \\nThis case should not be the first. \\nIII. THE TENTH CIRCUIT 'S OPINION CANNOT BE \\nSQUARED EITHER WITH THE FIRST \\nAMENDMENT 'S RICH HISTORY OR THIS COURT 'S \\nPROTECTION OF BELIEVERS ' FREE SPEECH \\nRIGHTS . \\nIn its permissive application of strict scrutiny, the \\nTenth Circuit bastardized this Court's protection of free speech rights, especially as applied to religious \\nexpression. If allowed to stand, its precedent will give license to courts across this Country to \\nhumiliate members of all religious sects by \\ncompelling them to speak in contravention of their \\nsincerely held religious beliefs. By purporting to \\napply strict scrutiny, the Tenth Circuit's opinion \\ncheapened the First Amendment rights of Catholics, \\nProtestants, Muslims, Jews, and all other believers alike. \\nLuckily, this precedent d oes not need to stand. \\nThis Court, once again, has an opportunity to \\nadmonish that the free speech protections of \\nbelievers are no less than non-believers and, in fact, \\nare heightened when faced with government \\nregulation that would compel speech antithetical to the tenants of a believer's faith. The First \\nAmendment commands such a result. \\n 28\\nAlthough the Tenth Circuit rightly concluded that \\nMs. Smith's website designs are \\\"pure speech,\\\" 303 \\nCreative LLC, 6 F.4th, at 1176, the Tenth Circuit \\nwrongly concludes that the commercial nature of Ms. \\nSmith's speech gives Colorado a regulatory hook to \\nlatch onto. Id., at 1179. By failing to acknowledge the \\nreligious nature of her objection to the would-be compelled speech, the Tenth Circuit did not afford \\nher First Amendment rights the \\\"preferred\\\" status \\nthey deserve.\\n5 Cf., Murdock , 319 U.S., at 115. What \\nis remarkable is that the religious nature of Ms. Smith's objection is not disputed. See 303 \\nCreative, 6 F. 4th, at 1172 (Ms. Smith is \\\"willing to create custom graphics and websites for gay, lesbian, \\nor bisexual clients . . . so long as the custom graphics \\nand websites do not violate [her] religious beliefs, as is true for all customers.\\\" (internal quotation marks \\nomitted)); id., at 1192 (Tymkovich, C.J., dissenting) \\n(\\\"In short, Colorado appear s to agree that Ms. Smith \\ndoes not distinguish between customers based on \\nprotected-class status and thus advances the aims of \\nCADA. But when any customer asks Ms. Smith to \\ncreate expressive content that violates her sincerely \\nheld beliefs, she will decline the request.\\\"). \\n                                           \\n5 Remarkably, the Tenth Circuit  suggests that its sweeping \\nholding may not apply to \\\"all artists\\\" if they were not engaged \\nin \\\"commercial activity,\\\" but rather \\\"commissioning a mural for some charitable purpose.\\\" 303 Creative , 6 F.4th, at 1182, n.6. To \\nsuggest that a local artist wh o refuses to paint a Christian \\nmural for a church may enjoy more constitutional protections \\nthan a woman called to live out her sincerely held religious \\nbeliefs by creating custom wedding websites is, thankfully, not supported by the history or tradition of the First Amendment \\nand the muscular protections it affords religious believers. \\n 29\\nThis failure is compounded by the Tenth Circuit's \\nfallacy of a marketplace of one for Ms. Smith's \\nspeech. Id. at 1180. Such convenient analysis \\nallowed the court to conclude \\\"there are no less intrusive means of providing equal access to those  \\ntypes of services.\\\" Id. (emphasis added). But this \\nclever reasoning flips this Court's precedent on its \\nhead. Rather than prioritize the religious speaker's \\nobjection in search of a less restrictive means, the \\ncourt below merely concluded that she is the only one and therefore no other means will suffice. But, \\nwhere, as here, the government can achieve its interests without burdening religion, the \\nConstitution requires it to do so. Fulton , 141 S. Ct., \\nat 1881. The analysis is also anomalous in the free speech context because it cannot be that the more \\nunique and distinctive the speech, the less  First \\nAmendment protection it deserves. But that is the staggering breadth of the Tenth Circuit majority's \\nconclusion. See 303 Creative , 6 F.4th, at 1204-05 \\n(Tymkovich, C.J., dissenting).  \\nMoreover, by categorizing Ms. Smith as nothing \\nmore than a \\\"public accommodation,\\\" the Tenth \\nCircuit minimized her right to participate in the \\nmarketplace, even as a woman of faith. See 303 \\nCreative, 6 F.4th, at 1181 (\\\"[W]hether an exception limits market access depends upon the uniqueness of \\nthe public accommodation's goods and services\\u2014not \\nthe sincerity of the public accommodation's beliefs.\\\"). \\nTo deny a benefit to those \\\"who engage in certain \\nforms of speech is in effect to penalize them for such \\nspeech,\\\" and constitutionally, no different than \\nconditioning a benefit on a person's \\\"willingness to \\nviolate a cardinal principle of her religious faith;\\\" the \\n 30\\nresult is the same: to \\\"deter[] or discourage[] the \\nexercise of First Amendment rights of expression.\\\" \\nSherbert , 374 U.S., at 405-06 (citing Speiser v. \\nRandall, 357 U.S. 513, 518 (1958)). Here too, Colorado seeks to impose the same constitutional \\nharm: speak in violation of your core religious faith \\nor lose the benefit of marketplace participation. Put \\nsimply, Colorado seeks to punish Ms. Smith for her \\nsincerely held religious beliefs. See also Trinity \\nLutheran Church , 137 S. Ct., at 2021\\u201322 (finding a \\nconstitutional violation where a burden puts \\nreligious believers \\\"to a choice: [] participate in an \\notherwise available benefit\\\" or maintain your \\nreligious identity). \\nThe same fundamental principle must apply to \\nfree speech and religious practices when they act in concert: \\\"In an open, pluralistic, self-governing \\nsociety, the expression of an idea cannot be \\nsuppressed simply because some find it offensive, \\ninsulting, or even wounding.\\\" Fulton , 141 S. Ct., at \\n1924-25 (Alito, J., concurring). To lose this principle is to lose the \\\"preservation of religious freedom.\\\" Id., \\nat 1925. That is because \\\"[s]uppressing speech\\u2014or \\nreligious practice\\u2014simply because it expresses an idea that some find hurtful is a zero-sum game.\\\" Id. \\nThis Court's jurisprudence confirms this link \\nbetween religious exercise and free speech because \\nthis Court's opinions \\\"make it perfectly clear that \\ndiscrimination against religious, as opposed to \\nsecular, expression is viewpoint discrimination.\\\" \\nNurre v. Whitehead , 559 U.S. 1025, 1028 (2010) \\n(Alito, J., dissenting). And because viewpoint discrimination is \\\"an egregious form of content \\ndiscrimination,\\\" Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of \\n 31\\nthe Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995), it brings \\nwith it heightened constitutional skepticism. \\nAlthough some may find Ms. Smith's religious \\nbeliefs objectionable, \\\"religions, and those who \\nadhere to religious doctrines, may continue to \\nadvocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by \\ndivine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be \\ncondoned.\\\" Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U.S. 644, 679 \\n(2015). \\\"An open society can keep that promise while still respecting the 'dignity,' 'worth,' and fundamental equality of all members of the \\ncommunity.\\\" Fulton , 141 S. Ct., at 1925 (Alito, J., \\nconcurring) (quoting Masterpiece Cakeshop , 138 S. \\nCt., at 1727). Ms. Smith should be free to practice all \\naspects of her faith, without fear of government-\\ncompelled expression against her sincerely held \\nreligious beliefs. The Constitution demands no less.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_args\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

      "[{'I. THE RULE OF LENITY SHOULD BE APPLIED RIGOROUSLY TO MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCING STATUTES': '\"[T]he rule of lenity[] teach[es] that ambiguities \\nabout the breadth of a cri minal statute should be \\nresolved in the defendant\\'s favor.\"  United States v. \\nDavis , 139 S. Ct. 2319, 2333 ( 2019).  That rule has \\nfamously been described as \"\\'perhaps not much less old than\\' the task of statut ory \\'construction itself.\\'\"  \\nId. (quoting United States v. Wiltberger , 18 U.S.  \\n(5 Wheat.) 76, 95 (1820) (Marshall, C.J.)).   \\nAt its core the rule of le nity is an understanding \\nthat \"a fair warning should be given to the world in \\nlanguage that the common world will understand,  \\nof what the law intends to  do if a certain line is \\npassed,\" and that, \"[t]o make  the warning fair, so far \\nas possible the line sh ould be clear.\"  McBoyle v. \\nUnited States , 283 U.S. 25, 27 (1931) (Holmes, J.).  In \\naddition, judicial adherence to the rule of lenity also \"places the weight of inertia upon the party\" – that \\nis, the executive branch – \"that can best induce \\nCongress to speak more clearly and keeps courts \\n 7 \\nfrom making criminal law in Congress\\'s stead.\"  \\nUnited States v. Santos , 553 U.S. 507, 514 (2008) \\n(plurality); see Bell v. United States , 349 U.S. 81, 83 \\n(1955) (Frankfurter, J.) (\" When Congress leaves to \\nthe Judiciary the task of imputing to Congress an \\nundeclared will, the ambiguity should be resolved in \\nfavor of lenity.\"). \\nIn several cases involving mandatory minimum \\nsentencing provisions, the Court has recognized and \\napplied the \"presupposition . . . [that] doubts in the enforcement of a penal code\" should be \"resolve[d] . . . \\nagainst the imposition of a harsher punishment.\"  Bell, 349 U.S. at 83.  Examples include Davis , which \\ninvoked lenity to reject a broader saving construction of a different provision of the same mandatory mini-\\nmum statute at issue here, see 139 S. Ct. at 2333; \\nBurrage v. United States , 571 U.S. 204 (2014), which \\ndescribed a 15-year mandat ory minimum statute as \\n\"a criminal statute subject to the rule of lenity,\" and \\nlenity as a reason the Court \"[e]specially\" could not \\ndepart from the \"ordinary,  accepted meaning\" of  \\n\"the [statutory] text,\" id. at 216; and United States  \\nv. Granderson , 511 U.S. 39 (1994), which \"appl[ied] \\nthe rule of lenity\" to \"resolve [an] ambiguity\" in a \"mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment\" \\nafter revocation of probation, id. at 56-57.  Those \\ndecisions cohere with others explaining that the rule of lenity assists \"not only to resolve issues about the \\nsubstantive scope of criminal statutes, but to answer questions about the severity of sentencing.\"  United \\nStates v. R.L.C. , 503 U.S. 291, 306 (1992) (plurality) \\n(citing Bifulco v. United States , 447 U.S. 381, 387 \\n(1980) (collecting cases)). \\nIndeed, especially good reasons warrant applying \\nthe rule of lenity rigorously to statutes that, like the \\nACCA, create aggravated offenses with mandatory \\n 8 \\nminimum sentences.  A broad construction bars \\njudges from tailoring the sentence to the offense and \\nthe offender, leading to particularly harsh conse-\\nquences that only Congress can correct.  A narrower \\nconstruction, by contrast, does not prevent judges \\nfrom imposing longer sentences where necessary.  \\n\"These interpretive asymmetries give the rule of \\nlenity special force in the context of mandatory \\nminimum provisions.\"  Dean v. United States , 556 \\nU.S. 568, 585 (2009) (Breyer, J., dissenting). \\nFurther, experience shows that mandatory mini-\\nmum statutes frequently present difficult problems \\nof statutory construction, creating a heightened risk \\nthat courts will read them to impose sentences that \\nCongress never intended.  Wh ere, as here, an unclear \\nstatute presents a palpable risk of error, courts \\nproperly refuse to \"condemn a man to a minimum of \\n15 years in prison on the basis of . . . speculation,\" \\nBegay v. United States , 553 U.S. 137, 154 (2008) \\n(Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment), about what \\nCongress meant to say.'}, {'A. The Rule of Lenity Helps Avoid the Particularly High Costs of Reading Mandatory Minimums Too Broadly': '1. The costs of erroneously construing mandatory \\nminimum sentencing provisions too broadly are especially high, and the costs of construing them too \\nnarrowly are especially low.  The greatest cost of \\nreading a mandatory minimu m too broadly is that \\nindividual defendants lose  their liberty.  Mandatory \\nminimum provisions are, by design, severe.  They \\noften tie an additional prison sentence of years or \\ndecades (here, a decade and a half) to a single factual \\ndetermination.  Such provisions therefore speak to \\nthe core concern that has motivated courts to apply \\nthe rule of lenity for centuries:  the \"instinctive \\n 9 \\ndistaste[] against men lang uishing in prison unless \\nthe lawmaker has clearly sa id they should.\"  Henry \\nJ. Friendly, \"Mr. Justice Frankfurter and the Reading of Statutes,\" in Benchmarks  196, 209 (1967), \\nquoted in United States v. Bass , 404 U.S. 336, 348 \\n(1971).  Because of that concern, this Court \"will not \\ninterpret a federal criminal statute so as to increase \\nthe penalty that it places on an individual when such \\nan interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what Congress intended.\"  Ladner v. \\nUnited States , 358 U.S. 169, 178 (1958). \\nFurther, mandatory minimum provisions often are \\nsaid to reflect (at least in theory) the moral judgment \\nof the community that particular conduct deserves \\nharsher punishment.  In our system of government, \\nthat judgment is reserved to the legislature.  The \\nrule of lenity ensures that criminal sentences \\nactually reflect legislative judgment, rather than \\nguesswork by the courts abo ut what the legislature \\nmeant.  See Granderson , 511 U.S. at 69 (Kennedy, J., \\nconcurring in the judgment) (\"\\'[B]ecause criminal punishment usually represents the moral condemna-\\ntion of the community, legislatures and not courts \\nshould define criminal activity,\\' and set the punish-\\nments therefor.\") (quoting Bass , 404 U.S. at 348) \\n(citation omitted); R.L.C. , 503 U.S. at 309 (Scalia, J., \\nconcurring in part and co ncurring in the judgment) \\n(describing one of \"the rule of lenity\\'s . . . purpose[s]\" \\nas \"assuring that the society, through its represen-\\ntatives, has genuinely called for the punishment to \\nbe meted out\"); Wiltberger , 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) at 95 \\n(explaining that \"[t]he rule that penal laws are to  be construed strictly\" is  founded not merely on \\n\"tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals\" \\nbut also on the \"plain principle that the power of \\n 10 \\npunishment is vested in the legislative, not in the \\njudicial department\"). \\nAny criminal statute presents these concerns,  \\nbut mandatory minimum provisions make them \\nparticularly weighty.  Unlike other criminal laws, \\nmandatory minimums are exceptions to the principle \\nthat courts should \"impose a sentence sufficient,  \\nbut not greater than necessary,\" to accomplish the goals of criminal punishme nt after considering  \\n\"the nature and circumstances of the offense and  \\nthe history and characteristics of the defendant.\"   \\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1).  A mandatory minimum is a \\ncongressional directive to subordinate justice in \\nindividual cases to a perceived need for greater \\ndeterrence or incapacitation generally.  Congress may choose to make that tradeoff (within constitu-\\ntional bounds), but the courts should ensure that \\nCongress has actually made that choice before \\nimposing needlessly harsh punishments.  Cf. Busic  \\nv. United States , 446 U.S. 398, 408-09 (1980) \\n(interpreting a sentencing enhancement; rejecting the \"assumption that . . . Congress\\' sole objective  \\nwas to increase the penalties . . . to the maximum \\nextent possible\"). \\n2. The adverse consequences of erroneously \\nexpanding mandatory sentencing beyond the limits of congressional intent affect more than just \\nindividual defendants.  Such errors strike at the \\nfoundations of the sentencing system by under-\\nmining \"sentencing proportionality – a key element of sentencing fairness.\"  Harris v. United States , 536 \\nU.S. 545, 570-71 (2002) (Breye r, J., concurring in \\npart and concurring in the judgment), overruled by \\nAlleyne v. United States , 570 U.S. 99 (2013).  As the \\nSentencing Commission – quoted with approval by this Court – has explained:  \"\\'The \"cliffs\" that result \\n 11 \\nfrom mandatory minimums compromise proportion-\\nality, a fundamental prem ise for just punishment, \\nand a primary goal of the Sentencing Reform Act.\\'\"  Neal v. United States , 516 U.S. 284, 291-92 (1996) \\n(quoting United States Sentencing Comm\\'n, Special \\nReport to the Congress:  Mandatory Minimum \\nPenalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System  iii \\n(Aug. 1991)). \\nFurther, the rule of leni ty historically has been \\njustified in part based on the \"principle of legality\":  conduct can be criminalized , and penalties author-\\nized, only by legislative action, so \"that the amount  \\nof discretion entrusted to those who enforce the law \\ndoes not exceed tolerable lim its.\"  Herbert L. Packer, \\nThe Limits of the Criminal Sanction  93 (1968).  As \\nthe Court put it in Marinello v. United States , 138 S. \\nCt. 1101 (2018), \"prosecutorial discretion\" to enforce \\na statute with \"wide-rangin g scope . . . places great \\npower in the hands of the prosecutor,\" creating risks of \"nonuniform execution\" and \"arbitary prosecution.\"  \\nId. at 1108-09.  That concern is one reason for  \\nthe Court\\'s \"\\'traditional[] exercise[]\\'\" of \"\\'restraint in \\nassessing the reach of a federal criminal statute.\\'\"  Id. at 1109 (quoting United States v. Aguilar , 515 \\nU.S. 593, 600 (1995)).  And it is a special problem \\nwith mandatory minimums that effectively transfer \\nsentencing discretion from the trial judge, \"the one \\nactor in the system most ex perienced with exercising \\ndiscretion,\" to \"an assistant prosecutor not trained in \\nthe exercise of discretion.\"   An Address by Anthony \\nM. Kennedy, Associate Justic e, Supreme Court of the \\nUnited States, Speech at the American Bar Associ-\\nation Annual Meeting (Aug. 9, 2003), available at  \\nhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/speeches/sp_08-09-03.html. \\n 12 \\nInconsistently exercised discretion means that, in \\npractice, mandatory minimums fail to yield even \\nuniformity in sentencing – the benefit they are \\nsupposed to obtain at the cost of individual justice \\nand proportionality.  Over decades, the Sentencing \\nCommission has repeatedly reported \"inconsisten[cy]\" \\nand \"wide geographic variations\" in the use of mandatory minimum sentences.  E.g., United States \\nSentencing Comm\\'n, Application and Impact of  \\n21 U.S.C. § 851:  Enhanced  Penalties for Federal \\nDrug Trafficking Offenders  6 (July 2018) (finding \\n\"significant variation in the extent to which . . . enhanced penalties were sought against eligible \\noffenders\"); see also United States v. Angelos , 345  \\nF. Supp. 2d 1227, 1252 (D. Utah 2004) (discussing \\n\"the potential for tremendous sentencing disparity if \\nfederal prosecutors across th e country do not uniformly \\ncharge . . . violations\" of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)), aff\\'d , 433 \\nF.3d 738 (10th Cir. 2006).\\n2   \\n                                                 \\n2 See also  United States Sentencing Comm\\'n, Mandatory \\nMinimum Penalties for Sex Offenses in the Federal Criminal \\nJustice System  56 (Jan. 2019) (finding that, \"[i]n fiscal year \\n2016, the mandatory minimum penalty for receipt [of child por-nography] [wa]s inconsistently applied,\" leading to \"substantial\" \\ndifferences in sentences where \"the conduct involved in the  \\noffenses was not meaningfully distinguishable\"); United States Sentencing Comm\\'n, Report to Congress:  Mandatory Minimum \\nPenalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System  345 (Oct. \\n2011) (\"2011 Report\") (finding \"inconsistencies in application  \\nof certain mandatory minimum penalties, as shown by . . .  \\ndata analyses and confirmed by interviews of prosecutors and \\ndefense attorneys\"); United States Sentencing Comm\\'n, Fifteen \\nYears of Guidelines Sentencing:  An Assessment of How Well  \\nthe Federal Criminal Justice System is Achieving the Goals  of Sentencing Reform  89 (Nov. 2004) (\"Research over the past \\nfifteen years has consistently found that mandatory penalty \\nstatutes are used inconsistently in cases in which they appear \\nto apply.\"). \\n 13 \\nIndeed, over the last two decades, different \\nAttorneys General have instructed federal prose-\\ncutors differently on how to use mandatory minimum \\nstatutes, switching between more- and less-aggressive \\napproaches.3  In adopting such policies, the executive \\nbranch takes into its own hands the tradeoff between \\nsentencing uniformity, on the one hand, and \\nindividual justice and proportionality, on the other.  Whatever the wisdom of the competing approaches, \\nthat practice emphasizes how mandatory minimum \\nstatutes transfer power over  individual liberty from \\nlawmakers and judges to pr osecutors.  In our adver-\\nsarial system, moreover, pr osecutors can and do use \\nthat power strategically in ways that undermine \\nstructural protections for individual liberties, such as by using the threat of a mandatory minimum to \\nobtain a guilty plea.  See United States v. Kupa ,  \\n976 F. Supp. 2d 417, 420 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) \\n(condemning the practice of \"coerc[ing] guilty pleas, \\nand sometimes . . . coerc[ing] cooperation as well,  \\n[by] routinely threaten[ing] ultra-harsh, enhanced mandatory sentences that no one  – not even the \\nprosecutors themselves – thinks are appropriate\") \\n(footnote omitted),  aff \\'d, 616 F. App\\'x 33  (2d Cir. 2015) . \\n                                                 \\n3 See Angelos , 345 F. Supp. 2d at 1253 & n.120 (discussing a \\n2003 memorandum intended \"to reduce charging disparities \\nstemming from § 924(c)\"); United States Sentencing Comm\\'n, \\nAn Overview of Mandatory Minim um Penalties in the Federal \\nCriminal Justice System 24-25 (July 2017) (comparing the 2013 \\n\"Smart on Crime\" initiative, which outlined circumstances  \\nin which prosecutors should \"\\'decline to charge\\'\" mandatory \\nminimum sentences, to \"revised guidance\" in 2017 directing \\nprosecutors generally to \"\\'charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense,\\'\" with seriousness measured by the \\ngreatest sentence, \" \\'including mandatory minimum sentences\\' \"). \\n 14 \\nNor does the expansion of prosecutorial power \\nthrough mandatory minimum statutes stop at the \\ncharging stage.  Even after conviction, the prosecutor \\nholds an important key to lessening the effect of a \\nmandatory minimum sentence.  A district court is \\nfreed from restrictions on its sentencing discretion \\n\"[u]pon motion of the Government . . . so as to reflect \\na defendant\\'s substantial assistance in the investi-gation or prosecution of another person,\" 18 U.S.C. \\n§ 3553(e), or it can similarly reduce the sentence \\nlater, again with the government\\'s approval, under \\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b)(4).\\n4  Suc h \\ndiscretionary motions have large effects on \\nsentences, often reducing them by many years.5  \\nResearch has found \"enorm ous differences in how \\nprosecutors exercise that di scretion, with substantial \\nvariation by district.\"6  Again, within broad constitu-\\ntional bounds, Congress has the power to create such \\na system.  But the Court need not and should not \\nbroaden more than Congress\\'s language requires \\n                                                 \\n4 In certain cases involving no n-violent drug offenders, a  \\ndistrict judge may invoke 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f), often called a  \\njudicial \"safety valve,\" but the sa fety valve is \"narrow\" and still \\nrequires prosecutorial approval in substance if not in form.   \\nRachel E. Barkow, Categorical Mistakes:  The Flawed Frame-\\nwork of the Armed Career Criminal Act and Mandatory Mini-\\nmum Sentencing , 133 Harv. L. Rev. 200, 218 (2019). \\n5 See United States Sentencing Comm\\'n,  Mandatory Minimum \\nPenalties for Firearms Offenses in the Federal Criminal Justice \\nSystem 42 (Mar. 2018)  (\"In fiscal year 2016, the average sentence \\nfor offenders who remained subject to the mandatory minimum \\npenalty [under § 924(e)] at sentencing was 200 months, signifi-cantly longer than the average sentence for offenders relieved of \\nthis mandatory minimum penalty (112 months).\"). \\n6 Barkow, Categorical Mistakes , 133 Harv. L. Rev. at  224 & \\nn.183, 236 & n.281 (discussing the 2011 and 1991 Reports). \\n 15 \\nstatutes that give prosecutors powers over individual \\nlives traditionally reserved  for independent judges. \\n3. By contrast, the costs of erroneously \\nconstruing a mandatory minimum provision too \\nnarrowly are relatively low, both for individual cases \\nand for the criminal justice system as a whole.  In \\ncases that fall outside the scope of a mandatory \\nminimum, but that nevertheless feature aggravating \\ncircumstances similar to those that moved Congress \\nto impose the minimum, a sentencing judge still has discretion (guided by § 3553(a) and the sentencing \\nguidelines) to impose a more severe sentence.  As Justice Breyer explained in Dean , \"an interpretive \\nerror on the side of leniency[] still permits  the \\nsentencing judge to impose a sentence similar to, \\nperhaps close to, the statutor y sentence even if that \\nsentence . . . is not legislatively required .\"  556 U.S. \\nat 584 (Breyer, J., dissenting). \\nMoreover, \"an error that excludes (erroneously) a \\nset of instances Congress me ant to include . . . could \\nlead the Sentencing Commission to focus on those cases . . . [and] make avail able to Congress a body of \\nevidence and analysis that w ill help it reconsider the \\nstatute.\"  Id. at 585.  Those who bring actions under \\nthe criminal laws (the executive branch) have far greater access to thos e who create them (the \\nlegislative branch) than do those who defend against \\nsuch actions (potential criminal defendants).  In light \\nof this practical reality, the rule of lenity \"places the \\nweight of inertia upon the party that can best induce \\nCongress to speak more clearly.\"  Santos , 553 U.S. at \\n514 (plurality).  \\n 16'}, {'B. The Risk of Reading Mandatory Minimums Too Broadly Is Also Particularly High': 'The risk of mistaking congressional intent is also \\nunusually high in the case of mandatory minimum \\nprovisions.  Those provisions often do not originate \\nfrom a careful and considered drafting process.   \\nThe history of the \"occasions different from one \\nanother\" language of § 924(e) (1) is a good example:  \\nas petitioner shows in detail, that language stemmed \\nfrom then-Solicitor-General  Fried\\'s confession of \\nerror to this Court in Petty v. United States , 481 U.S. \\n1034 (1987) (No. 86-6263).  In that case, the United States candidly admitted that the different-occasions \\nlanguage, present in \"other enhanced penalty \\nprovisions,\" was omitted from the predecessor to \\n§ 924(e)(1), even though the legislative history \\nshowed \"that both Congress and those supporting the legislation, including the Department of Justice, did \\nnot intend that the penalty provision would apply \\nmore broadly than in the case of the other federal \\nenhanced penalty statutes.\"   Pet. Br. App. 25a-26a; \\nsee id.  at 26a-31a. \\nHad the United States not taken the unusual step \\nof confessing error in Petty , the courts might well \\nhave concluded – as the Eighth Circuit already had –that Congress had intentionally left the different-occasions language out of th e statute.  After all,  \\nas the Solicitor General\\'s brief pointed out, courts \\nconstruing statutes often draw a \"negative implica-\\ntion\" from the omission of  language in one statute \\nthat is present in anot her, similar statute.  Id. at  \\n26a (citing Rodriguez v. United States , 480 U.S. 522, \\n525 (1987) (per curiam)).  An d courts reaching that \\nconclusion would have imposed minimum 15-year \\nsentences, not based on a \"genuine[] call[] for th[at] \\n 17 \\npunishment\" by \"society[\\'s] . . . representatives,\" R.L.C. , \\n503 U.S. at 309 (Scalia, J., concurrring in part and concurring in the judgment), but based on a slip of the legislative pen. \\nThere are other examples.  Indeed, § 924(e) \\npresents one:  its \"residual clause\" defined a \"violent \\nfelony\" to include any felony that \"involves conduct \\nthat presents a serious potential risk of physical \\ninjury.\"  18 U.S.C. § 924( e)(2)(B)(ii).  This Court \\nstruck that clause down as unconstitutionally vague \\nin Johnson v. United States , 576 U.S. 591 (2015), \\nrelying in part on \"[n]ine years\\' experience trying to derive meaning from the residual clause\" as evidence \\nthat the courts had \"embarked upon a failed enterprise.\"  Id. at 601-02.  And the Court reached \\nthe same conclusion in Davis as to § 924(e)\\'s cousin \\n§ 924(c), striking down a similarly vague clause that \\ntriggered mandatory minimum sentences of 5, 7, 10, and 25 years.  See 139 S. Ct. at 2325, 2336. \\nIn United States v. O\\'Brien , 560 U.S. 218 (2010), \\nthe Court described as \" unclear\" yet another provi-\\nsion of § 924(c) that i mposed a 30-year mandatory \\nminimum sentence for possessing a machinegun \\nwhile committing certain crimes.  Id. at 227, 229.  \\nFacing that lack of clarity, the Court applied a  five-factor test to determine whether machinegun \\npossession was intended to be an offense element  or as a sentencing factor.  See id. at 227-32.  In \\nGranderson , the Court diplomatically observed that \\n18 U.S.C. § 3565(a), imposi ng a mandatory minimum \\nsentence for certain revocations of parole, did not \\n\"appear[] . . . to have received Congress\\' careful \\nattention.\"  511 U.S. at 42.  Justice Scalia less \\ndiplomatically called § 3565(a) \"wretchedly drafted.\"  \\nId. at 60 (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment). \\n 18 \\nThe Court\\'s repeated struggles with opaque text \\nand structure in mandatory minimum provisions  \\nare the kind of \"experience\"  that is \"the life of the \\nlaw.\"  Johnson , 576 U.S. at 601.  That experience \\nteaches that mandatory minimum sentencing statutes, including the one at issue here, commonly \\nuse \"sweeping and imprecise language\" that \"set[s] \\nup a host of vexing constitutional and statutory \\ninterpretation questions for the courts.\"  Barkow, \\nCategorical Mistakes , 133 Harv. L. Rev. at 202.   \\nThe rule of lenity, \"as a so rt of \\'junior version of  \\nthe vagueness doctrine,\\'\" United States v. Lanier , \\n520 U.S. 259, 266 (1997) (quoting Packer, Criminal \\nSanction  at 95), is a useful doctrinal approach to \\nanswering those questions.  If the Court finds the \\nstatute now before it ambiguous, lenity can help – \\nand an emphasis on lenity in the context of \\nmandatory minimum statutes can help guide the \\nlower courts to solve futu re, similar problems that \\nwill inevitably arrive.\\n7 \\n                                                 \\n7 Some have stated that \"a court must find not just ambiguity \\nbut \\'grievous ambiguity\\' before resorting to the rule of lenity.\"  \\nShular v. United States , 140 S. Ct. 779, 788 & n.2 (2020)  \\n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (collecting examples).  Other recent decisions, drawing on a long line of authority, have applied \\nprinciples of lenity without the adjective \"grievous.\"  See, e.g., \\nDavis , 139 S. Ct. at 2333 (invoking lenity where \"a criminal \\nstatute . . . d[id] not clearly proscribe\" conduct and stating that \\n\"ambiguities about the breadth of a criminal statute should  be resolved in the defendant\\'s favor\").  The notion that lenity \\napplies only in cases of \"grievous ambiguity\" appeared in this \\nCourt\\'s cases relatively recently.  See Chapman v. United \\nStates , 500 U.S. 453, 463 (1991) (quoting Huddleston v. United \\nStates , 415 U.S. 814, 831 (1974), which had stated that the \\nCourt \"perceive[d] no grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in\" a \\nstatute before it, id., but did not suggest that \"grievous ambigu-\\nity\" was a threshold requirement for any reliance on lenity).  \\nThe rule of lenity itself goes back for centuries.  In any event, \\n 19'}, {'II. JUDICIAL EXPERIENCE WITH 18 U.S.C. section 924(e)(1) SUPPORTS APPLYING THE RULE OF LENITY': 'Petitioner\\'s brief ably sets forth why the Sixth \\nCircuit\\'s analysis finds no support in the ACCA\\'s \\ntext, history, or purpose.  FAMM agrees that this \\nCourt can and should reverse the judgment of the \\nSixth Circuit without resort to the rule of lenity or the principles that underlie it.  If the Court finds the \\nquestion close, however, it may help to consider \\njudicial experience applying the same standard that \\nthe Sixth Circuit applied here.  Examining that \\nexperience counsels in favor of lenity. \\nThat experience shows that the approach of the \\ncourt of appeals – asking wh ether \"it [is] possible to \\ndiscern the point at which the first offense is \\ncompleted and the subsequent point at which the \\nsecond offense begins,\" JA22 – does not satisfy this \\nCourt\\'s teaching that \"so far as possible the line should be clear.\"  McBoyle , 283 U.S. at 27.  Nor does \\nthat test align, in any way \"the common world will \\nunderstand,\" id., with Congress\\'s effo rt to classify as \\nan armed career criminal someone who has \"three previous convictions . . . for a violent felony or a \\nserious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions \\ndifferent from one another, \" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1).  \\nInstead, the temporal-sequencing test is at best \"no \\nmore than a guess as to what Congress intended,\" \\nLadner , 358 U.S. at 178 – a guess that produces \\narbitrary and unpredictable results. \\n                                                                                                   \\nwhere all the tools of statutory construction fail to resolve genu-\\nine ambiguity as to whether Congress has demanded a manda-\\ntory prison term, that ambiguity can fairly be called \"grievous.\" \\n 20'}, {'A. Entries of Separate Structures on a Single Day or Night Are Not Clearly Multiple Different \"Occasions\"': '1. The decision under review  is a useful starting \\npoint.  According to the Sixth Circuit, all 10 of Wooden\\'s 1997 convictions for burglary, which took \\nplace on a single night, were \"separate ACCA \\npredicate offenses\" that occurred on \"\\'occasions \\ndifferent from one another.\\'\"  JA21 (quoting 18 \\nU.S.C. § 924(e)(1)).  To support that conclusion, the court of appeals reasoned that, \"[w]hatever the \\ncontours of a \\'mini\\' wareho use, Wooden could not be \\nin two (let alone ten) of them  at once\"; that he \"could \\nhave ceased his criminal conduct\" after entering the \\nfirst warehouse without en tering nine more; and \\nthat, although \"one could characterize th[e] cluster of \\nwarehouses as being adjoined \\'at the same business location,\\'\" they were \"different locations\" because  \\ntheir owners had \"distinct se ts of property rights.\"  \\nJA23-24. \\nWooden argues persuasively (at 30) that the \\n\"textual foundations\" for the court of appeals\\' \"test \\n. . . are essentially nonexistent.\"  Even if the statute \\ndoes not wholly foreclose th at test, it certainly gives \\nno fair warning that unlawfully entering 10 small \\nwarehouses within the same building on a single \\nevening triggers a harsh 15-year penalty for later \\nowning a gun, while spending the same amount  \\nof time in a single warehouse would not.  The court  \\nof appeals\\' analysis thus  \"mak[es] criminal law  \\nin Congress\\'s stead.\"  Santos , 553 U.S. at 514 \\n(plurality).  At best it is judicial doctrine built up  \\nto cover the lack of clarity in the statute, rather  \\nthan anything that can claim to be an application of \\nthe statute itself.  Those who agree with Justice \\nScalia that \"it is not consistent with the rule of lenity \\n 21 \\nto construe a textually ambiguous penal statute \\nagainst a criminal defendant on the basis of legis-\\nlative history,\" R.L.C. , 503 U.S. at 307 (Scalia, J., \\nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment), \\ncan stop there, because the statute is at least \\ntextually ambiguous.   \\nThose who look to legislative history as an \\ninterpretive guide should reach the same ultimate \\nconclusion.  As Wooden persuasively shows (at 21-\\n25), that history ranges fr om an Assistant Attorney \\nGeneral\\'s 1984 testimony that the statute was meant \\nto catch \"people who have demonstrated . . . that \\nlocking them up and letting them go doesn\\'t do any \\ngood,\" Pet. Br. Add. 29a; to the Solicitor General\\'s 1987 concession in Petty that the statute was \\n\"intended\" to cover \"multiple criminal episodes,\" id. \\nat 26a; to then-Senator Biden\\'s 1988 statement that \\nthe statute was meant to \"express[] [a] concept of \\nwhat is meant by a \\'career criminal,\\'\" 134 Cong. Rec. S17,370 (daily ed. Nov. 10, 1988).  None of this \\nsuggests an intent – let alone a clear one – to \\nconsider multiple offenses on a single night to be a \\ncareer in crime because it took a few seconds to move \\nfrom one mini-warehouse to another within a cluster \\nof such warehouses. \\n2. The Fourth Circuit\\'s decision in United States \\nv. Carr , 592 F.3d 636 (4th Cir. 2010), illustrates the \\nsame point.  That case involved Daryl Carr, who possessed a firearm after previously pleading guilty \\nto 13 state-law charges of \"felony breaking or entering.\"  Id. at 638.  Those 13 offenses all took \\nplace on a single day in 2006 during which Carr broke into each of 13 \"different storage unit[s]\" at  \\nthe same street addres s (\"N.C. 32 South\").  Id.  The \\ncourt of appeals conceded that the offenses were \\n\"substantively the same and arguably had the same \\n 22 \\ncriminal objective,\" but it nevertheless found them  \\nto be \"separate and distinct criminal episodes.\"  Id.  \\nat 645.  It reasoned that  the storage units were \\n\"different locations\"; that mo st, though not all, of the \\noffenses had \"different victims\"; and that Carr \"had \\nthe opportunity . . . to cease and desist his criminal \\nbehavior\" between one storage unit and the next, \\nadding in a footnote that \"Carr simply could not have \\nbroken into or entered the 13 separate storage units simultaneously.\"  Id. at 645 & n.8 (citation omitted).\\n8 \\nIn that analysis, the Fourth Circuit asserted that \\nthe statutory \"\\'definition may be clear\\'\" but conceded \\nthat \"\\'the factual permutations surrounding the \\nACCA tend to create havoc\\'\"; that \"\\'courts have \\napplied a multiplicity of factors\\'\" in cases involving \\n§ 924(e); and that the \"analysis\" has a \"fluid nature.\"  Id. at 640 (quoting United States v. Letterlough ,  \\n63 F.3d 332, 335 (4th Cir.  1995)).  That sort of \\nassessment ought to be a warning sign in construing a criminal statute:  it calls to mind this Court\\'s \\nobservation in Johnson that \"pervasive disagreement \\nabout the nature of the inquiry one is supposed to \\nconduct and the kinds of factors one is supposed to \\nconsider\" is a sign of unacceptable vagueness.  576 \\nU.S. at 601.  The present case, to be sure, is not  \\na vagueness challenge.  But the rule of lenity – and  \\nthe \"constitutional principles underlying th[at] rule,\" \\nDavis , 139 S. Ct. at 2333 n. 8 – counsels against \\nadopting a line of authority whose own proponents \\nreport fluidity at best and havoc at worst. \\n                                                 \\n8 In another footnote, the Fourth Circuit noted that Carr had \\nother \"state convictions\" on different dates, at least one of which \\ninvolved \"assault by pointing a gun,\" Carr , 592 F.3d at 639 n.3, \\nbut did not analyze whether they  constituted ACCA predicates \\nor rely on them for its holding. \\n 23 \\n3. The Seventh Circuit\\'s decision in United States \\nv. Hudspeth , 42 F.3d 1015 (7th Cir. 1994) (en banc), \\ninvolved Thomas Hudspeth, who on one day in 1983 broke into three businesses – \"a doughnut shop, a dry \\ncleaners, and an insurance company.\"  Id. at 1018-19.  \\nThe businesses were in the same \"strip mall,\" id., \\nwhere the burglars made \"a hole through [a] shared wall\" and \"forced open the door\" connecting two of \\nthe businesses, id. at 1022.  The whole affair took \\n\"approximately thirty-five minutes.\"  Id. at 1018-19.  \\nA majority of the Seventh Circuit held that, because Hudspeth\\'s three offenses were \"committed sequen-\\ntially, against different victims, at different times, \\nand at different locations,\" they were \"clearly crimes \\n\\'committed on occasions different from one another.\\'\"  Id. at 1021. \\nOne concurrence reasoned that Hudspeth was \\n\"appropriately sentenced because . . . the record shows three separate crimes against separate victims \\nand not a single crime or criminal occasion (whatever that is).\"  Id. at 1025 (Bauer, J., concurring).  One \\npartial dissent noted that past decisions had \"grappl[ed] with the ambi guity of the ACCA\" and \\nnoted \"the malleability of the relevant terms,\" including the different-occasions language.  Id. at \\n1025-26 (Flaum, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Another, joined by  five of the 11 judges who \\nheard the case, agreed that the \"cold print of the \\nstatute books\" did not answ er the question before  \\nthe court and argued for interpreting § 924(e) as  \\na \"congressional mandate . . . to identify the true recidivist.\"  Id. at 1034, 1037 (Ripple, J., concurring \\nin part and dissenting in part).  \\nNone of the opinions in Hudspeth suggested \\napplying the rule of lenity.  Yet at least six members \\n 24 \\nof the en banc court – counting Judge Bauer, whose \\nconcurrence expressed marked frustration with the \\nstatutory language – appear to have found no answer \\nto the question before them in § 924(e).9  As judicial \\nexperience goes, that is further evidence that \\n\"Congress le[ft] to the Judiciary the task of imputing \\nto Congress an undeclared will,\" Bell, 349 U.S. at 83, \\nconcerning prior offenses that occur over a short \\nperiod of time in several adjacent structures.'}, {'B. Evading or Resisting Arrest Does Not Clearly Involve Multiple Different \"Occasions\"': 'Another  situation that repeatedly arises under \\n§ 924(e) is an offense af ter which the defendant \\nevades or resists arrest.  A rule that focuses on \\nsequence in time treats evasion or resistance as a \\ndifferent \"occasion,\" because it is possible to imagine a point at which the defendant stops the first offense \\nand starts running.  But an ordinary person trying  \\nto figure out the meaning of the statute from its \\nwords would not likely reach that conclusion.  Nor  \\ndo the tools of statutory construction suggest that \\nCongress meant to treat such an offender as a career \\ncriminal deserving 15 years in prison. \\n1. In United States v. Schieman , 894 F.2d 909 \\n(7th Cir. 1990), David Schi eman received a 15-year \\nsentence based in part on prior convictions of \\nburglary and aggravated batte ry of a police officer.  \\nId. at 910.  As a partial dissent explained:  \\n                                                 \\n9 Hudspeth relied on police reports to determine the circum-\\nstances of prior offenses; Shepard v. United States , 544 U.S. 13, \\n16 (2005), later barred courts from considering police reports  \\nin applying § 924(e).  The Seventh Circuit has since cited  \\nHudspeth as \"abrogated\" at least in part by Shepard .  See, e.g., \\nUnited States v. Elliott , 703 F.3d 378, 384 n.3 (7th Cir. 2012). \\n 25 \\nSchieman committed a robbery, walked three \\nblocks away to make a telephone call [at a phone \\nbooth] to arrange transportation away from the \\nscene, and, in an attempt to evade apprehension, \\npushed a police officer at the phone booth.  The \\npushing incident occurred approximately five \\nminutes after the robbery. \\nId. at 913 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and \\ndissenting in part).  The majority reasoned that, \"[o]nce the original crime is complete, there is no \\nprincipled way to distinguish\" between a battery \\n\"within ten minutes of the burglary\" and one \"a day after the burglary.\"  Id. at  913 (majority). \\nOne giving the words \"different\" and \"occasion\" \\ntheir ordinary meaning might well think that both \\nSchieman\\'s burglary and his attempt to escape five \\nminutes later occurred on the same occasion.  One \\nthinking of the statute as an attempt to identify \\ncareer criminals would reach the same result.  And \\nthe Schieman court\\'s reasoning only emphasizes  \\nhow traditional principles of lenity support that conclusion.  The court took a case it thought clear \\n(escape a day later) and used it to resolve a case  \\nit thought unclear (escape five minutes later) by \\narguing the lack of a \"principled . . . distin[ction]\" \\nbetween the two.  But the felt need to invoke the day-after hypothetical itself shows that the statute does \\nnot speak clearly to the five -minute case.  The court\\'s \\nrole was therefore to limit the 15-year sanction to the \\ncase where it was unambiguously intended. \\n2. In United States v. Davidson , 527 F.3d 703 \\n(8th Cir. 2008), vacated in part on other grounds , 551 \\nF.3d 807 (8th Cir. 2008) (per curiam), Mark Davidson \\nwas sentenced under § 924(e)  based on prior convic-\\ntions that included an attempted domestic assault \\n 26 \\nand fleeing from a police officer who interrupted that \\nattempt with a traffic stop.  Id. at 707.  The Seventh \\nCircuit conceded that the \"pause between the two offenses was brief\" and that the crimes were \\ncommitted in \"rapid succession,\" but reasoned that  \\na \"moment of relative calm\" had occurred when  \\nthe officer stopped Davidson, creating \"a point of \\ndemarcation between episodes\" that justified treating \\nDavidson\\'s prior convictions as separate.  Id. at 710. \\nThe Davidson court candidly acknowledged that \\nthe circuits had \"struggled with th[e] problem\" of applying § 924(e) to resist ance or evasion offenses, \\n\"reaching arguably inconsistent results,\" id. at 709, \\ndiscussing Schieman and other examples.  Considered \\nas an exercise in the common-law method, the \"point of demarcation\" analysis that Davidson derived \\nmight not be exceptional.  But it has been settled \\nsince United States v. Hudson , 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 32 \\n(1812), that \"federal crimes . . . are solely creatures of \\nstatute,\" Liparota v. United States , 471 U.S. 419, 424 \\n(1985), a principle that lenity helps protect, see id. at \\n427-28.  And the distinction that Davidson and cases \\nlike it draw – if it can even be squared with the \\nstatute at all – is clearly a rule made by the courts \\nrather than one set down by statute. \\n3. In Levering v. United States , 890 F.3d 738 (8th \\nCir. 2018), Merwyn Leveri ng was sentenced under \\n§ 924(e) based on prior convictions that included at \\nleast two assaults in the cour se of a high-speed flight \\nfrom police officers in a stolen automobile.  Id. at \\n739.  Levering argued that the assaults were not committed on different occasions because the flight \\nwas a \"\\'continuous course of conduct.\\'\"  Id. at 741.  \\nThe Eighth Circuit acknowledged that \"the phrase \\n\\'continuous course of conduct\\' appears in our cases on \\n 27 \\nthis subject,\" but rejected  it as \"unhelpful to the \\nanalysis.\"  Id. at 742.  Instead, the court relied on the \\nfact that the assaults were committed \"at different times in different counties against different victims.\"  \\nId.  The Eighth Circuit acknowledged that several \\nunpublished decisions from the Sixth Circuit pointed \\nto a different result, but \"respectfully differ[ed]\" with them.  Id.   \\nLike the Fourth Circuit\\'s acknowledgment of \"havoc\" \\nin Carr , the vigorous disagreement among members \\nof the Seventh Circuit in Hudspeth , and the Eighth \\nCircuit\\'s own earlier acknowledgment of \"arguabl[e] \\ninconsisten[cy]\" in Davidson , the reasoning of \\nLevering points to the type of pervasive uncertainty \\nabout statutory application that suggests courts have gone beyond the guidance that an unclear statute \\ncan offer.  It is especially  telling that – as the Eighth \\nCircuit\\'s criticism of the Sixth Circuit shows – courts theoretically applying the sa me sequential test reach \\ndifferent results as to similarly situated defendants. \\n4. None of this is to deny that fleeing from arrest \\nand assaulting someone while doing so is not serious misconduct that state and sometimes federal law \\nproperly criminalize.  The police officer in Schieman \\ncould have been hurt, as could the bystanders to the \\nhigh-speed chases in Davidson and Levering .  Nor is \\nthere any doubt that after their prior convictions the \\nvarious defendants were prohibited from possessing guns, see 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), and could be punished \\nfor breaking that law.  The function of § 924(e), \\nhowever – as its text, structure, and history all show – is to carve out a special set of repeat offenders, \\nlabeled as \"armed career criminals,\" for special \\ncondemnation and harsh mandatory punishment.  It \\nis impossible to read the cases struggling with these \\n 28 \\nissues and conclude that the legislature has \"clearly \\nsaid\" that those defendants should \"languish[] in \\nprison,\" Bass , 404 U.S. at 348 (cit ation omitted), for \\nat least 15 years.'}]\n"

She also has a master\\u2019s degree in bioethics and completed the National Catholic Bioethics Center ethics certificate course. In addition to her full-time clinical duties within the neonatal intensive care unit of a large regional medical center, Dr. Pierucci remains active in perinatal palliative care, and ongoing performance improvement projects.  She has multiple publications in peer and non-peer reviewed journals and has spoken around the country on multiple perinatal and ethical topics.  As an expert in caring for extremely young premature babies, Dr. Pierucci understands that medical science provides only limited ability to determine neonatal survival and that such a determination is best made by trained and experienced neonatologists, not abortion providers.  Dr. Pierucci contests the disconnect between two standards of care that are allowed under current law: the same patient that neonatologists such as herself are ethically, medically, and legally responsible to treat, obstetricians can legally abort. While the law currently allows two standards of care, the science informs us that a unique human \\t\\t1  This brief was wholly authored by counsel for amici Robin Pierucci, M.D. and Life Legal Defense Foundation.

Though human beings look different at different stages of development (e.g., embryo, fetus, neonate, toddler, adolescent, adult, elderly), we are always human beings. Because we are always human beings, doctors always have the obligation to provide the best care possible, and the state will always have an equal obligation to safeguard all its members. Amicus Life Legal Defense Foundation is a California non-profit 501(c)(3) public interest legal and educational organization that works to assist and support those who advocate in defense of life. Its mission is to give innocent and helpless human beings of any age, particularly unborn children, a trained and committed defense against the threat of death, and to support their advocates in the nation\\u2019s courtrooms. Life Legal Defense Foundation believes life begins at the moment of conception and does not end until natural death. We litigate cases to protect human life, from preborn babies targeted by a billion-dollar abortion industry to the elderly, disabled, and medically vulnerable denied life-sustaining care.  Life Legal Defense Foundation sees in the present case an opportunity for this Court to right a 47-year-old wrong: the stripping from states of their authority to protect the lives of innocent human beings within their borders.  SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT  The Fifth Circuit held that the State of Mississippi\\u2019s Gestational Age Act was an \\n \\t3 \\n unconstitutional ban on pre-viability abortions, based on Supreme Court precedent in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992). Cert. Pet. App.  13a. The lower court noted that, although viability \\u201cmay differ with each pregnancy\\u201d and is dependent on a variety of factors, nonetheless \\u201cviability is the critical point.\\u201d  Id. at 12a and n. 34 (quoting Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 388-89 (1979)).  Because of this Court\\u2019s precedents, the Fifth Circuit was forced to adhere to a legal framework this Court has never explained.  This Court first bestowed constitutional significance on the concept of viability in its abortion jurisprudence in 1973, at which time it stated, \\u201cViability is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks.\\u201d Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 160 (1973). Within two decades, that already generous window has shifted by several weeks.2 More importantly, as this brief will demonstrate, viability outside the womb depends on a variety of external and subjective factors, including individual physicians\\u2019 competence, continuing education in neonatal medicine, personal and institutional philosophies of the \\t\\t2 See, e.g., Isaacson v. Horne, 716 F.3d 1213, 1233 (9th Cir. 2013) (Kleinfeld, J., concurring) (\\u201cViability is the \\u2018critical fact\\u2019 that controls constitutionality. That is an odd rule, because viability changes as medicine changes. As Planned Parenthood v. Casey noted, between Roe v. Wade in 1973 and the time Casey was decided in 1992, viability dropped from 28 weeks to 23 or 24 weeks, because medical science became more effective at preserving the lives of premature babies.\\u201d)  \\n \\t4 \\n provision of life-sustaining medical interventions, and physician attitudes toward disabilities and societal challenges.  Amici join Petitioner Dobbs in urging this Court to revisit the doctrine of viability and clarify that the State\\u2019s interest in preserving the life of human beings in the womb is not contingent on the entirely unrelated question of the possible medical outcomes if the mother went into labor and delivered the child prematurely.  This Court should grant the Petition and reverse the judgment of the Fifth Circuit.  ARGUMENT  I. THE VIABILITY BENCHMARK WITH ROE CONFLICTS WITH THIS COURT\\u2019S DETERMINATION THAT THERE IS AN UNQUALIFIED COMPELLING STATE INTEREST IN PRESERVING HUMAN LIFE.   In Cruzan v. Dir., Mo. Dep't of Health, 497 U.S. 261 (1990), this Court found that the state not only has an interest in protecting an individual\\u2019s right to life, but also has \\u201can interest in life\\u201d itself. Id. at 281. This holding was consistent with the Court\\u2019s finding in Roe v. Wade that the state has an \\u201cimportant and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life.\\u201d Roe, 410 U.S. at 162.  In both cases, the state\\u2019s interest in life and in protecting human life were weighed against an \\n \\t5 \\n individual\\u2019s constitutional rights (right to due process and right to privacy, respectively).  In Roe, this Court determined that the state\\u2019s interest in the protection of human life became compelling at viability, relying on the fetus\\u2019 \\u201ccapability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb.\\u201d Id. at 163. By contrast, in Cruzan this Court rejected the idea of \\u201cmeaningful life,\\u201d holding that \\u201ca State may properly decline to make judgments about the \\u2018quality\\u2019 of life that a particular individual may enjoy, and simply assert an unqualified interest in the preservation of human life to be weighed against the constitutionally protected interests of the individual.\\u201d Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 282; Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 729 (1997) (quoting Cruzan and holding that the state \\u201chas an unqualified interest in the preservation of human life\\u201d) (emphasis added). See also Britell v. United States, 372 F.3d 1370, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (\\u201cIt is not the role of the courts to draw lines as to which fetal abnormalities or birth defects are so severe as to negate the state's otherwise legitimate interest in the fetus' potential life.\\u201d); State v. Final Exit Network, Inc., 889 N.W.2d 296, 305-06 (Minn. Ct. App. 2016) (\\u201cThe state has a compelling interest in the preservation of D.D.\\u2019s life, and the prevention of her suicide, regardless of her incurable [non-viable] condition.\\u201d)   Limiting a state\\u2019s ability to protect human lives directly to only those lives deemed \\u201cmeaningful\\u201d because the arbitrary benchmark of viability has been reached is in direct conflict with this Court\\u2019s 1990 holding in Cruzan, that a state \\n \\t6 \\n need not qualify its interest in the preservation of human life before acting.    This Court should grant the petition to resolve the conflict between its abortion jurisprudence and its decisions in Cruzan and Glucksberg allowing states to protect human life regardless of the \\u201cmeaningfulness\\u201d of that life as measured by the uncertain yardstick of viability.  II. THERE IS NO \\u201cPOINT\\u201d IN PREGNANCY AT WHICH VIABILITY \\u201cOCCURS.\\u201d   In Roe, this Court established viability as the \\u201cpoint\\u201d at which the state\\u2019s interest in protecting human life becomes compelling, allowing the state to prohibit abortion. The Court defined viable as \\u201cpotentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid.\\u201d Roe, 410 U.S. at 160. One commentator noted that, with this holding, this Court \\u201cseems to mistake a definition for a syllogism.\\u201d3 Indeed, this Court has never attempted to elaborate on why a child\\u2019s ability or inability to survive outside the womb in the case of a premature delivery has any bearing on the state\\u2019s interest in protecting the child from being killed inside the womb.  In Roe, the Court could not locate the so-called \\u201cpoint\\u201d of viability more precisely than to say that it is \\u201cusually placed about seven months (28 \\t\\t3 John Hart Ely, The Wages of Crying Wolf: A Comment on Roe v. Wade, 82 YALE L. J. 920, 924 (1973). \\n \\t7 \\n weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks.\\u201d Id. Thus, even as first enunciated by this Court, the \\u201cpoint\\u201d when viability \\u201coccurred\\u201d ranged across 10% of a full-term 40-week pregnancy.4 A few years later, this Court acknowledged that multiple factors go into the assessment of viability including \\u201cfetal weight, based on an inexact estimate of the size and condition of the uterus; the woman's general health and nutrition; the quality of the available medical facilities; and other factors.\\u201d Colautti, 439 U.S. at 395-96 (emphasis added). In other words, there is no \\u201cpoint\\u201d of viability in pregnancy generally, or even in any particular pregnancy.  It gets worse. Colautti assigned the role of assessing the viability of the fetus to the \\u201cresponsible attending physician,\\u201d i.e., the abortion provider. However, to the extent any given abortion provider has relevant5 specialized training, such training would be in obstetrics, not neonatology.  Abortion providers are unlikely to stay current on medical advancements for infant survival. The largest abortion provider networks, Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the National Abortion Federation, offer continuing \\t\\t4 Pregnancy is commonly dated from the onset of the mother\\u2019s last menstrual period (LMP), approximately two weeks before conception. All gestational ages described in this brief are dated from LMP.  5 Relevant as opposed to specialized training in, e.g., radiology or ophthalmology. Cf. June Medical Servs. L. L. C. et al. v. Russo. 2020 LEXIS 3516 at *116 (2020) (abortion provider \\u201chired a radiologist and ophthalmologist to do abortions\\u201d). \\n \\t8 \\n medical education on clinical abortion procedure but not on infant viability.6 The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology follows the same pattern, focusing its continuing education offerings related to abortion on maternal care, not infant viability.7 Neonatologists, not obstetricians, are the experts in viability.  Unsurprisingly, the presence or absence of specialized training makes a noticeable difference in how physicians practice as well. A 2015 study by the Indiana University School of Medicine found that obstetricians and neonatologists approach patient consultations in drastically different ways. Obstetricians tend to discuss topics like maternal health risks, while neonatologists focus on post-birth complications and treatment options for the \\t\\t6 Among abortion providers, infant survival is a \\u201ccomplication\\u201d to be carefully avoided.

Injecting further subjectivity into the viability calculus is the fact that a physician\\u2019s personal philosophy and attitude regarding the provision of life-sustaining medical interventions impacts the actual survival rate of an infant. Study after study throughout the world has shown that offering immediate life-sustaining treatment to preemies is the largest modifiable factor affecting infant survival.9   Compare, for example, the difference in survival rates between two American neonatal \\t\\t8 B. Tucker Edmonds, F. McKenzie, et al., Comparing Obstetricians\\u2019 and Neonatologists\\u2019 Approaches to Periviable Counseling, 35 J. Perinatology 344 (May 2015). 9 See, e.g., C. H. Backes et al., Outcomes Following a Comprehensive Versus a Selective Approach for Infants Born at 22 Weeks of Gestation, 39 J. Perinatology 39, 45 (2019) (hospital that routinely provided prenatal corticoster-oid administration, neonatal resuscitation, and intensive care had substantially higher survival rates [53 percent] than the hospital that only selectively provided such care [8 percent]); J. Lorenz, Management decisions in extremely premature infants, 8 Seminars in Neonatology 475 (December 2003), available at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1084275603001180 (\\u201cThere is significant variability between developed nations in the survival of extremely premature infants among cohorts born within perinatal tertiary care centres. This is, at least to some degree, the result of differences in the aggressiveness of obstetrical and neonatal management at these gestational ages.\\u201d) \\n \\t10 \\n facilities that work with extremely pre-term births. At the University of Iowa, physicians default to immediate, active medical treatment for all pre-term infants starting at 22 weeks\\u2019 gestation.10 These physicians have long seen over a 60% survival rate for babies in the 22-week category. Physicians at the University directly credit their default-to-treatment strategy for the high survival rate.11 By contrast, Providence Women and Children\\u2019s Services of Oregon has a very different rate of survival for 22-week births. The physicians there have a facility-wide policy to not provide care for any 22-week births, regardless of the parents\\u2019 wishes, and thus they have a 0% survival rate. Moreover, because the success of treatment rate is also dependent on the experience of doctors, Providence has a much lower survival rate for 23-week births, as well \\u2013 only 21%, compared to the national average of 38%.12 \\t\\t10 In a 2020 publication, University of Iowa neonatologists reported they provided immediate, active medical intervention for 97% of periviable births in their facility between 2006 and 2015. For the purposes of this study, a periviable birth was defined as a birth that occurred after 21 weeks\\u2019 gestation, but before 26 weeks\\u2019 gestation.  11 Keith Barrington, Active intervention at 22 weeks\\u2019 gestation, is it futile?, Neonatal Research Blog (Oct. 29, 2018), available at https://neonatalresearch.org/2018/10/29/active-intervention -at-22-weeks-gestation-isit-futile/; P. Watkins, J. Dagle, et al., Outcomes at 18 to 22 Months of Corrected Age for Infants Born at 22 to 25 Weeks of Gestation in a Center Practicing Active Management, 217 J. Pediatrics 52 (Feb 2020). 12 Patrick J. Marmion, Periviability and the \\u2018god committee,\\u2019 106 Acta Paediatrica 857 (Jun 2017). \\n \\t11 \\n  Clearly, the willingness of a neonatologists to provide active care to a baby after birth is a large factor in the child\\u2019s chance of survival. The philosophy of defaulting against care lowers the survival rate, even for those children who do receive care. Conversely, when a facility defaults to immediate active medical intervention, survival rates of all treated neonates increase.13   The decision for or against medical care for premature babies is also shaped by attitudes toward disability. A November 2019 report from the National Council on Disability found:   [m]any healthcare providers critically undervalue life with a disability. Providers often perceive people with disabilities to have a low quality of life when, in reality, most report a high quality of life and level of happiness, especially when they have access to sufficient healthcare services and supports. This misperception has negatively influenced physicians\\u2019 medical futility decisions and resulted in the withdrawal of necessary medical care from people with disabilities.14   \\t\\t13 M. A.

Med. 1801 (2015). 14 National Counsel on Disability, Medical Futility and Disability Bias, Bioethics and Disability Series at 10 (Nov. 2019).  \\n \\t12 \\n Such biases play a large role in setting institutional policies concerning whether to default against care in dealing with premature newborns, where there is an incorrect presumption that most if not all survivors will have severe disabilities.15 In discussing treatment decisions with parents, doctors may use the word futile as code to mean that the survival of the baby is not worth the cost of the treatment.16 Though various studies have shown that, when adjusted for future life expectancy, costs for NICU treatments are one-twentieth to one-tenth the costs of treatments for adult ICU patients,17 some researchers and doctors are reluctant to allow that the quality of life obtained is worth the treatment costs. In doing so, a circular dynamic is established where anticipated poor prognoses lead to denial of medical care, which in turn leads to poor outcomes and low survival rates, reinforcing the data underlying the original poor prognosis.   The same circularity can manifest itself with regard to social conditions. In 2018, the University of Texas released a report of the disparity between infant mortality rates from zip code to zip code.18 \\t\\t15 P. Watkins, J. Dagle, et al., Outcomes at 18 to 22 Months of Corrected Age for Infants Born at 22 to 25 Weeks of Gestation in a Center Practicing Active Management, 217 J. Pediatrics 52 (Feb 2020). See also Patrick J. Marmion, Decreasing disabilities by letting babies die, 33 Issues in Law and Medicine 209 (Nov 2018). 16 Barrington, supra n. 11. 17 Marmion, supra, n. 12. 18 E. Nehme, et al., Infant mortality in communities across Texas, The University of Texas (2012). \\n \\t13 \\n Though Texas had an infant mortality rate lower than the national average, troubling findings were uncovered when some zip codes were shown to have disparities as high as 12 times the rates of neighboring zip codes.19 While all races had areas of high infant mortality, Black mothers had the highest rates of infant mortality overall.20 Even when a mother lives in a locale flooded with medical resources, a child\\u2019s chance of survival can decrease if none of the local hospitals have enough experience in saving the lives of extremely premature babies. While generally speaking, the availability of a NICU in a geographical area increases chances of survival, when NICUs become more commonplace, each unit may see fewer individual cases of periviable births each year and, thus, have less experience in successfully treating these babies.21 This can then perpetuate the myth that active treatment is \\u201cfutile,\\u201d which may indurate a physician\\u2019s incorrect assumption that a child of a certain age or weight is simply non-viable.   In sum, this Court\\u2019s assumption in Roe, Colautti, and Casey that there is a \\u201cpoint\\u201d in pregnancy when viability \\u201coccurs\\u201d is mistaken. Viability is a prediction, not a point. Even if there were such a point, it would be impossible for most doctors, especially abortion providers who rarely \\t\\t19 Id. at 7. 20 Id. at 12. 21  R.

Viability depends on myriad factors that vary and fluctuate both before and after birth, from the physical to the philosophical, from the personal to the institutional to the systemic.  III. ATTACHING CONSTITUTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE TO VIABILITY IS ILLOGICAL.   Why is any of this relevant to the case at issue? Mississippi\\u2019s Gestational Age Act bans almost all abortions after 15 weeks\\u2019 gestation. Petitioners have never suggested that an unborn child at 15 weeks\\u2019 gestation is capable of sustained survival outside the womb under any circumstances, so why does uncertainty about the \\u201cpoint\\u201d of viability matter? It matters because this Court has built a constitutional framework on an illogical and imaginary premise, undeserving of the benefit of stare decisis.  As noted above, this Court\\u2019s explanation in Roe of the significance of the non-existent \\u201cpoint\\u201d of viability consisted simply of restating the definition of viability. Colautti, in turn, took the significance of viability as a given, with no further attempt at explaining the logic behind it. Rather, Colautti emphasized that, because the point of viability (i.e., \\u201ca reasonable probability of the fetus\\u2019 sustained survival outside the womb\\u201d) is specific to each pregnancy and can be determined only by the attending physician, \\u201cneither the legislature nor \\n \\t15 \\n the courts may proclaim one of the elements entering  into the ascertainment of viability -- be it weeks of gestation or fetal weight or any other single factor -- as the determinant of when the State has a compelling interest in the life or health of the fetus.\\u201d Colautti, 439 U.S. at 388-389 (emphasis added). This Court has never revoked or modified Colautti\\u2019s holding that an abortion ban based on gestational age is impermissible, and that determination of viability must be left to the judgment of the \\u201cresponsible attending\\u201d abortion provider. As the years rolled by, dissenting justices continued to point out the illogic of attaching constitutional significance to viability, e.g.,    The governmental interest at issue is in protecting those who will be citizens if their lives are not ended in the womb. The substantiality of this interest is in no way dependent on the probability that the fetus may be capable of surviving outside the womb at any given point in its development, as the possibility of fetal survival is contingent on the state of medical practice and technology, factors that are in essence morally and constitutionally irrelevant. The State's interest is in the fetus as an entity in itself, and the character of this entity does not change at the point of viability under conventional medical wisdom. Accordingly, the State's interest, if compelling after viability, is equally compelling before viability. \\n \\t16 \\n  Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747, 795 (1986) (White, J., dissenting). See also, City of Akron v. Akron Ctr. for Reprod. Health, 462 U.S. 416, 461 (1983) (O\\u2019Connor, J., dissenting) (\\u201cThe choice of viability as the point at which the state interest in potential life becomes compelling is no less arbitrary than choosing any point before viability or any point afterward.\\u201d)   However, the plurality in Casey, relying on stare decisis, reaffirmed the Court\\u2019s commitment to the constitutional significance of viability, even while acknowledging that its original judgment might have been unsound:  [V]iability marks the earliest point at which the State's interest in fetal life is constitutionally adequate to justify a legislative ban on nontherapeutic abortions. The soundness or unsoundness of that constitutional judgment in no sense turns on whether viability occurs at approximately 28 weeks, as was usual at the time of Roe, at 23 to 24 weeks, as it sometimes does today, or at some moment even slightly earlier in pregnancy, as it may if fetal respiratory capacity can somehow be enhanced in the future.  Casey, 505 U.S. at 860 (emphasis added). In affirming \\u201cRoe\\u2019s central holding,\\u201d the Casey plurality also restated Roe\\u2019s utterly false premise \\n \\t17 \\n that viability \\u201coccurs\\u201d at a \\u201cpoint\\u201d or \\u201cmoment\\u201d in pregnancy. The Casey plurality made a self-conscious attempt to explain the reasoning behind the viability standard:  The second reason is that the concept of viability, as we noted in Roe, is the time at which there is a realistic possibility of maintaining and nourishing a life outside the womb, so that the independent existence of the second life can in reason and all fairness be the object of state protection that now overrides the rights of the woman.22   Casey, 505 U.S. at 870.  However, as Justice Scalia pointed out,  [t]he arbitrariness of the viability line is confirmed by the Court's inability to offer any justification for it beyond the conclusory \\t\\t22 This Court also half-heartedly offered a third justification for drawing a line a viability: \\u201cThe viability line also has, as a practical matter, an element of fairness. In some broad sense it might be said that a woman who fails to act before viability has consented to the State's intervention on behalf of the developing child.\\u201d Casey, 505 U.S. at 870. However, given government data showing that over 90% of abortions are performed in the first trimester and over 98% by 20 weeks of pregnancy (CDC, Abortion Surveillance \\u2013 Findings and Reports (2016), available at https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/data_stats/abortion.htm), laches could be said, as a matter of fairness, to come into play well before viability.  \\n \\t18 \\n assertion that it is only at that point that the unborn child's life \\\"can in reason and all fairness\\\" be thought to override the interests of the mother. . . .  Precisely why is it that, at the magical second when machines currently in use (though not necessarily available to the particular woman) are able to keep an unborn child alive apart from its mother, the creature is suddenly able (under our Constitution) to be protected by law, whereas before that magical second it was not? That makes no more sense than according infants legal protection only after the point when they can feed themselves.  Id. at 989, fn. 5 (Scalia, J., concurring and dissenting).23  With a touch of unconscious irony, the Casey plurality distinguished the freedom of legislatures to \\u201cdraw lines which appear arbitrary without the necessity of offering a justification\\u201d from its own duty to justify its line-drawing. Id. at 870. But no legal scholar has found this Court\\u2019s justification persuasive, much less compelling.24 This Court\\u2019s \\t\\t23 A closer analogy than Justice Scalia\\u2019s might be found in the concept of \\u201cpool safe,\\u201d defined as the stage of development at which a child has a reasonable chance of survival if he or she accidentally falls into a swimming pool. Analogizing to viability, the state may act to protect the life of a pool-safe child, but may not act to protect a child who is not pool safe from being held face down in a bucket of water until dead.  24 See, e.g., Paul Benjamin Linton and Maura K. Quinlan, Does Stare Decisis Preclude Reconsideration of Roe v. Wade? A Critique of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 70 Case W. Res. L. \\n \\t19 \\n fictitious \\u201cpoint of viability\\u201d line has less justification than Mississippi\\u2019s line of 15 weeks, based as the latter is on the science of fetal development, preservation of maternal health, and protection of medical ethics. Compare Pet. Cert. at 15-20 (examining viability standard) with id. at 20-26 (justification for 15-week abortion limit).   The Casey plurality also noted that \\u201cthere is no line other than viability which is more workable.\\u201d Casey, 505 U.S. at 370. But, as demonstrated above, viability is not a line, or a point, or a moment, and for that reason, it is less \\u201cworkable,\\u201d and certainly gives less notice, than a limit on abortion stated in weeks of gestational age justified by factors such as anatomical development, the capability of feeling pain, or the presence of a heartbeat. Viability as determined by the abortion provider is \\u201cworkable\\u201d only in the sense that it is unenforceable, and thus does not give rise to difficult cases. It \\u201cworks\\u201d for the abortion industry, but not for the state trying to protect unborn children.   CONCLUSION \\t Mississippi\\u2019s 15-week abortion restriction is well-supported by the state\\u2019s compelling interest in the preservation of human life. Additionally, the \\t\\tRev. 283 (2019), available at https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/caselrev/vol70/iss2/9 for a detailed critique of the viability standard.  \\n \\t20 \\n viability threshold for a compelling state interest in preserving human life, created by this Court in 1973, should be abandoned in favor of the medically updated and philosophically consistent standard of an \\u201cunqualified\\u201d interest in protecting life that this Court upheld in the 1990 case of Cruzan. This Court should grant the petition for certiorari and reverse the judgment of the Fifth Circuit.  Respectfully submitted,  CATHERINE W. SHORT  Counsel of Record ALEXANDRA SNYDER ALLISON K.

CAC works in our courts, through our government, and with legal schol-ars to improve understanding of the Constitution and preserve the rights and freedoms it guarantees.  CAC has a strong interest in ensuring meaningful access to the courts, in accordance with constitutional text and history, and therefore has an interest in this case. INTRODUCTION AND  SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT According to Yassir Fazaga and the other plain-tiffs in this case, the FBI used an informant to gather information about them and make surreptitious re-cordings of their private conversations\\u2014all because of their religion.  In response to their lawsuit alleging vi-olations of the Constitution and the Foreign Intelli-gence Surveillance Act (FISA), the government tried to invoke the state secrets privilege to have the case dis-missed, but the court below held that the privilege was displaced here by FISA procedures allowing judges to review materials concerning electronic surveillance in camera to determine the lawfulness of the surveil-lance.  Disagreeing with that conclusion, the govern-ment attempts to buttress its statutory arguments by  1 The parties have consented to the filing of this brief.  Under Rule 37.6 of the Rules of this Court, amicus states that no counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part, and no counsel or party made a monetary contribution intended to fund the prep-aration or submission of this brief.  No person other than amicus or its counsel made a monetary contribution to its preparation or submission. \\n2 invoking constitutional principles that it says should control the Act\\u2019s interpretation.  This effort to tilt the interpretive scales in the government\\u2019s favor should be rejected.   According to the government, the state secrets privilege \\u201cis rooted in the Executive\\u2019s Art[icle] II duties to protect the national security and conduct foreign af-fairs.\\u201d  Pet. Br. 3.  Because of that \\u201cconstitutional foun-dation,\\u201d the government says, this Court should not in-terpret FISA here in the same way that statutes are normally construed\\u2014instead, it should adopt a pre-sumption against displacement of the state secrets privilege by requiring a \\u201cclear statement . . . that Con-gress intended to bring about such a startling change in the Executive\\u2019s authority to protect national-secu-rity information.\\u201d  Id. at 3, 47.  In other words, accord-ing to the government, \\u201cany ambiguity should be con-strued in favor of retaining the privilege.\\u201d  Id. at 19. The government\\u2019s position rests on a misleading account of the state secrets privilege that is at odds with the history of the privilege and this Court\\u2019s prec-edents.  In reality, the judiciary has never grounded the state secrets privilege in the Constitution; rather, it developed the privilege as a matter of federal com-mon law, using its power to devise evidentiary rules based on its own perceptions of sound public policy.  In-deed, far from representing a construction of the pres-ident\\u2019s inherent Article II authority over military and foreign affairs, the key aspects of the state secrets priv-ilege were drawn from twentieth-century case law in the United Kingdom, which this Court imported nearly wholesale into federal common law when it es-tablished the contours of the privilege in United States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1 (1953).  None of this Court\\u2019s decisions resolving state secrets questions has ever \\n3 relied on the separation of powers or inherent execu-tive authority under the Constitution. In addition to distorting the legal basis for the state secrets privilege, the government also exagger-ates its historical pedigree.  For most of the nineteenth century, there was no American case law recognizing any privilege from disclosing state secrets in judicial proceedings.  See Robert M. Chesney, State Secrets and the Limits of National Security Litigation, 75 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1249, 1273-77 (2007).  While the govern-ment claims that episodes in the early Republic indi-cate a recognition of the executive\\u2019s power to withhold sensitive information from disclosure, those inci-dents\\u2014each of which is deeply ambiguous\\u2014at best represent early expressions of a general concept of ex-ecutive privilege, rooted in concerns over confidential-ity in government communications.  These episodes have little if any bearing on the state secrets privilege and provide no evidence of a constitutional foundation for that doctrine. Rather than stemming from principles widely ac-cepted in the early Republic, the concept of an eviden-tiary privilege protecting state secrets from disclosure in court proceedings was a later innovation that devel-oped slowly in American jurisprudence.  And far from reflecting constitutional imperatives, the privilege was justified, at every step of its development, exclusively by the courts\\u2019 common law authority to shape eviden-tiary rules in service of public policy. The idea of a state secrets privilege entered Amer-ican legal thought through the works of nineteenth-century treatise writers, who drew on diverse strands of English precedent in an effort to \\u201crationalize and systematize the body of common law evidentiary rules.\\u201d  Id. at 1270.  When this Court first endorsed a bar against the judicial enforcement of espionage \\n4 agreements in Totten v. United States, 92 U.S. 105 (1875), it similarly relied on analogies to common law privileges shielding \\u201cconfidential\\u201d information from disclosure, as well as on general notions of \\u201cpublic pol-icy,\\u201d id. at 107, without referencing constitutional con-siderations of any kind.  See Gen. Dynamics Corp. v. United States, 563 U.S. 478, 485 (2011) (describing Totten as a use of \\u201cour common-law authority to fash-ion contractual remedies\\u201d). Notwithstanding Totten, which involved a \\u201cunique and categorical\\u201d rule barring certain types of suits en-tirely, Tenet v. Doe, 544 U.S. 1, 6 n.4 (2005), it was not until the early twentieth century that \\u201c[t]he core of a distinctive \\u2018state secrets\\u2019 privilege, focused on security-related matters, . . . beg[a]n to emerge,\\u201d Chesney, su-pra, at 1281.  Over the first half of that century, a num-ber of lower court decisions recognized an evidentiary privilege against the public disclosure of government materials on the ground that their release would harm the public interest.  Throughout this period, the emerging state secrets privilege continued to be under-stood as a common law evidentiary doctrine, not a mat-ter of constitutional law, supported by citations to treatises, pragmatic arguments from necessity, and vague invocations of \\u201cpublic policy.\\u201d  Firth Sterling Steel Co. v. Bethlehem Steel Co., 199 F. 353, 355 (E.D. Pa. 1912). Before Reynolds, state secrets jurisprudence re-mained \\u201climited and vague, and failed to set forth a standardized doctrine by which privilege claims ought to be evaluated.\\u201d  Sudha Setty, Litigating Secrets: Comparative Perspectives on the State Secrets Privi-lege, 75 Brook. L. Rev. 201, 232 (2009).  When this Court eventually fleshed out the contours of the state secrets privilege and outlined a process to use in ad-ministering it, this Court acknowledged that judicial \\n5 experience with the privilege had been \\u201climited in this country.\\u201d  Reynolds, 345 U.S. at 7.  To fill the gap, this Court turned to contemporary developments in the United Kingdom, largely adopting the substantive and procedural standards for the privilege that had been recently prescribed by the House of Lords in Duncan v. Cammell, Laird & Co., [1942] A.C. 624 (H.L.).   Critically, Reynolds derived none of its new stand-ards from the separation of powers or the president\\u2019s Article II authority.  Indeed, this Court expressly dis-claimed any reliance on constitutional principles when fashioning these standards\\u2014despite the government\\u2019s urging of an \\u201cinherent executive power\\u201d under the Constitution to withhold materials from the judiciary.  See 345 U.S. at 6 & n.9.  Instead, Reynolds \\u201cdecided a purely evidentiary dispute by applying evidentiary rules.\\u201d  Gen. Dynamics, 563 U.S. at 485.  As in prior decisions concerning the state secrets privilege, this Court exercised its authority under federal common law to recognize evidentiary privileges based on gen-eral assessments of good public policy.   Reynolds remains \\u201cthe only instance in which [this] Court has articulated a standard for the state secrets privilege.\\u201d  Setty, supra, at 208; cf. Tenet, 544 U.S. at 8-9 (applying the Totten bar while distinguish-ing it from the Reynolds privilege); Gen. Dynamics, 563 U.S. at 485-87 (same).  To be sure, passages in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974), a case that did not concern state secrets, may suggest that Arti-cle II calls for some type of evidentiary privilege ena-bling the president to safeguard military and diplo-matic secrets from public disclosure.  \\u201cPlainly, how-ever,\\u201d whatever \\u201ccore\\u201d of the state secrets privilege might be constitutionally compelled \\u201cdoes not account for the full scope of the privilege as it has come to be understood.\\u201d  Chesney, supra, at 1309.  None of the \\n6 specific components of the privilege articulated in Reynolds has ever been linked to constitutional imper-atives\\u2014including the rules concerning in camera re-view of allegedly privileged material.   In light of this history, the government is wildly off base to portray the state secrets privilege as \\u201cfirmly rooted in the Constitution,\\u201d with its common law ori-gins relegated to an afterthought.  Pet. Br. 42.  Far from being the product of constitutional analysis, the standards governing the state secrets privilege were patterned on foreign sources in the course of exercising the courts\\u2019 authority to craft evidentiary rules under federal common law, without any consideration of Ar-ticle II or the separation of powers.   There is no warrant, therefore, for placing an in-terpretive thumb on the scale in the government\\u2019s fa-vor here by imposing an unusual requirement that Congress be \\u201cunmistakably clear\\u201d in displacing the state secrets privilege.  Pet. Br. 16 (quoting Pet. App. 110a (Bumatay, J., dissenting from the denial of re-hearing en banc)).  Instead, this case should be re-solved just like any other statutory dispute in which a party argues that Congress has supplanted federal common law.  Under that standard, for the reasons ex-plained by Respondents, the decision below should be affirmed. ARGUMENT I. The State Secrets Privilege Is Not a Product of Constitutional Analysis but of Federal Common Law. In the government\\u2019s telling, the state secrets priv-ilege is \\u201cinherent in the constitutional design\\u201d and has been \\u201cacknowledged since our Nation\\u2019s founding.\\u201d  Pet. Br. 46 (quoting Pet. App. 134a (Bumatay, J., dissent-ing from denial of rehearing en banc)).  In reality, the \\n7 standards governing the privilege \\u201cemerged during the mid-twentieth century,\\u201d Chesney, supra, at 1271, and were fashioned as a matter of federal common law without reference to the Constitution.  Constitutional reasoning concerning executive authority and the sep-aration of powers has played no role at any point in the long development of the state secrets privilege. A. Nineteenth-century precursors to the state secrets privilege invoked English common law and general notions of public policy. Although the government cites episodes from the early Republic to claim that the state secrets privilege has been \\u201cacknowledged since our Nation\\u2019s founding,\\u201d Pet. Br. 46 (quoting Pet. App. 134a), those episodes have no clear relationship to the privilege.  See infra Part II.  Until the late nineteenth century, there was no American case law recognizing any \\u201cprivilege against court-ordered disclosure of state and military secrets.\\u201d  Gen. Dynamics, 563 U.S. at 484. Instead, the concept of such a privilege entered American legal thought in the mid\\u2013nineteenth cen-tury, thanks to \\u201ctreatise writers actively seeking to ra-tionalize and systematize the body of common law ev-identiary rules.\\u201d  Chesney, supra, at 1270.  Given \\u201cthe absence of on-point case law in the United States,\\u201d these authors \\u201crelied extensively on English prece-dent.\\u201d  Id. at 1273.  They did not root their discussions in the American separation of powers or the presi-dent\\u2019s constitutional authority.  Rather, citing English decisions and general notions of public policy, these authors combined \\u201cdisparate threads\\u201d under \\u201cthe um-brella concept of a multifaceted \\u2018public interest\\u2019 privi-lege, some aspects of which were referred to under the subheading of \\u2018state secrets.\\u2019\\u201d  Id. at 1270-71. \\n8 For example, Thomas Starkie\\u2019s English treatise on evidence\\u2014subsequently published and widely influen-tial in America\\u2014discussed the exclusion of evidence \\u201con grounds of public policy,\\u201d including in situations where \\u201cdisclosure might be prejudicial to the commu-nity.\\u201d  1 Thomas Starkie, A Practical Treatise on the Law of Evidence 69, 71 (7th Am. ed. 1842).  This dis-cussion integrated \\u201cthree distinct lines of English prec-edent\\u201d involving protections for criminal informers, for the deliberative process, and for information kept se-cret \\u201con security grounds.\\u201d  Chesney, supra, at 1274; see, e.g., Starkie, supra, at 71-72 (citing Rex v. Watson, 2 Starkie\\u2019s C. 148 (K.B. 1817), where, for public safety, \\u201can officer from the Tower of London could not be ex-amined as to the accuracy of a plan of the Tower\\u201d). Simon Greenleaf\\u2019s treatise, \\u201carguably the first suc-cessful volume of this nature to be written from an ex-plicitly American perspective,\\u201d Chesney, supra, at 1276, likewise discussed evidence \\u201cexcluded from mo-tives of public policy,\\u201d including \\u201csecrets of State . . . the disclosure of which would be prejudicial to the public interest,\\u201d 1 Simon Greenleaf, A Treatise on the Law of Evidence 327 (7th ed. 1854).  Greenleaf\\u2019s \\u201csecrets of state\\u201d category encompassed a diverse range of situa-tions not tied to military or foreign affairs, was based primarily on English precedent, and referenced no American constitutional law principles.  See id. at 329.   While treatises propagated the idea of evidentiary privileges tied to public safety, it was not until 1875, in Totten, that this Court first established \\u201ca Govern-ment privilege against court-ordered disclosure of state and military secrets.\\u201d  Gen. Dynamics, 563 U.S. at 484.  Totten \\u201cpreclude[d] judicial review\\u201d entirely in cases \\u201cwhere success depends upon the existence of [a] secret espionage relationship with the Government,\\u201d Tenet, 544 U.S. at 8, essentially concluding that \\u201csome \\n9 claims against the government are simply not justici-able based on the nature of the claim being made and the need for government secrecy,\\u201d Setty, supra, at 233.  While Totten\\u2019s \\u201cunique and categorical\\u201d bar to suit is distinct from the more limited evidentiary privilege recognized in later cases, Tenet, 544 U.S. at 6 n.4, it was \\u201ca significant extension of the still-evolving con-cept of a state secrets privilege,\\u201d Chesney, supra, at 1278; see Gen. Dynamics, 563 U.S. at 485-86 (describ-ing Totten as part of \\u201cour state-secrets jurisprudence\\u201d). Totten \\u201cat no point described its holding in separa-tion of powers or other constitutional terms.\\u201d  Chesney, supra, at 1278.  \\u201cRather, the Court simply spoke in terms of the detrimental \\u2018public policy\\u2019 ramifications of permitting lawsuits regarding unacknowledged espio-nage contracts to proceed,\\u201d id. at 1278-79, reasoning that secrecy was an implied term of such contracts, precluding \\u201cany action for their enforcement,\\u201d Totten, 92 U.S. at 107; cf. Gen. Dynamics, 563 U.S. at 490 (\\u201cAs in Totten, our refusal to enforce this contract captures what the ex ante expectations of the parties were or reasonably ought to have been.\\u201d (citation omitted)).   Given the secret matters involved, Totten com-pared the enforcement of espionage contracts to other types of suits that could not be pursued because they would \\u201clead to the disclosure of matters which the law itself regards as confidential.\\u201d  Totten, 92 U.S. at 107 (citing suits that \\u201cwould require a disclosure of the con-fidences of the confessional, or those between husband and wife, or of communications by a client to his coun-sel for professional advice, or of a patient to his physi-cian\\u201d).  As with those other examples of common law evidentiary privileges, suits to enforce espionage agreements were prohibited for the simple reason that exposing the relevant facts would be to the \\u201cserious detriment of the public.\\u201d  Id.  \\u201c\\u2018[P]ublic policy,\\u2019\\u201d this \\n10 Court held, \\u201cforbids the maintenance of any [such] suit.\\u201d  Gen. Dynamics, 563 U.S. at 486 (quoting Totten, 92 U.S. at 107).  Totten thus \\u201cfollowed the British ex-ample . . . in recognizing a public-policy justification in American law for precluding public disclosure of infor-mation on security-related grounds.\\u201d  Chesney, supra, at 1278.   In short, Totten was an exercise of the judiciary\\u2019s \\u201ccommon-law authority to fashion contractual reme-dies in Government-contracting disputes.\\u201d  Gen. Dy-namics, 563 U.S. at 485; see id. at 488 (explaining that courts may refuse, \\u201con grounds of public policy,\\u201d to aid an \\u201cunenforceable promise\\u201d).  Totten\\u2019s \\u201cpublic policy\\u201d rationale arose from that common law framework, not from any reference to Article II or the separation of powers.  And that rationale persists today.  See id. at 487 (\\u201crefusal to enforce promises contrary to public policy . . . is not unknown to the common law, and the traditional course is to leave the parties where they stood\\u201d); id. at 491 (\\u201cwhat we promulgate today is . . . a common-law opinion\\u201d). B. When a privilege concerning state secrets began to emerge in the twentieth century, it was based on federal common law authority to shape evidentiary rules in service of public policy. \\u201cBy the late nineteenth century, treatise writers in the United States had begun to refer expressly to a \\u2018state secrets\\u2019 privilege.\\u201d  Chesney, supra, at 1280.  But they were still using that term \\u201cmuch as the early writ-ers had referred to a \\u2018public interest\\u2019 privilege: namely, as an umbrella concept integrating cases like Totten . . . with precedents concerning the informer\\u2019s privi-lege, the deliberative-process privilege, and the gov-ernment-communications privilege.\\u201d  Id.  Only \\u201cin the \\n11 early twentieth century\\u201d did the \\u201c[t]he core of a distinc-tive \\u2018state secrets\\u2019 privilege, focused on security-re-lated matters, . . . begin to emerge.\\u201d  Id. at 1281.  The nature of the privilege remained nebulous throughout this period, with little articulation of its standards or procedures.  But the nascent doctrine was firmly un-derstood as a common law evidentiary principle\\u2014not a matter of constitutional law\\u2014justified by citations to treatises, pragmatic arguments from necessity, and vague invocations of public policy. Over the first half of the twentieth century, in \\u201cfairly conclusory fashion and without extended anal-ysis, a handful of lower courts considered what was in substance a state secrets privilege, typically described as a \\u2018military or national security privilege.\\u2019\\u201d  Anthony John Trenga, What Judges Say and Do in Deciding National Security Cases: The Example of the State Se-crets Privilege, 9 Harv. Nat\\u2019l Sec. J. 1, 12 (2018).  In the absence of any comprehensive standards or \\u201cunify-ing doctrine,\\u201d Setty, supra, at 234, these decisions rested on vague invocations of \\u201cpublic policy,\\u201d sup-ported by citations to treatises, English precedent, and Totten.  See Firth Sterling, 199 F. at 355 (citing those sources for \\u201cthe rule of public policy forbidding the dis-closure of military secrets\\u201d); Robinson v. United States, 50 Ct. Cl. 159, 167 (1915) (\\u201cThe Government is not re-quired to answer questions or supply papers which on the grounds of public policy it is entitled to resist.\\u201d); Pollen v. United States, 85 Ct. Cl. 673, 679 (1937) (re-lying on treatises and the \\u201cmany English cases\\u201d pro-tecting \\u201cmilitary secrets, the disclosure of which . . . would be detrimental to the National defense\\u201d).   Courts universally understood the emerging state secrets privilege to be a common law evidentiary doc-trine.  See O\\u2019Neill v. United States, 79 F. Supp. 827, 829 (E.D. Pa. 1948) (citing \\u201cthe general policy of the \\n12 common law, prohibiting disclosure of state secrets the publication of which might . . . harm the government in its diplomatic relations, military operations or measures for national security\\u201d); Firth Sterling, 199 F. at 355 (stating that \\u201cat common law\\u201d the court \\u201cmight, upon grounds of public policy, strike out evidence of this nature\\u201d).  Constitutional principles were not in-voked.   Indeed, when decisions of this era elaborated on the theoretical justification for the privilege, they de-scribed it as a matter of practical necessity emanating from a right of self-preservation intrinsic to all govern-ments.  See, e.g., Pollen, 85 Ct. Cl. at 681 (the privilege is \\u201cpredicated upon the principle of the public good and the right of the Sovereign to maintain an efficient Na-tional defense,\\u201d which \\u201ctranscends the individual in-terests of a private citizen\\u201d).  The reasoning was prag-matic, not constitutional, and no emphasis was placed on executive branch authority vis-\\u00e0-vis the other branches.  See, e.g., Pollen v. Ford Instrument Co., 26 F. Supp. 583, 584 (E.D.N.Y. 1939) (citing \\u201cthe inherent right of self-preservation for purposes of national de-fense\\u201d as \\u201ca paramount government right\\u201d).   Because courts were fashioning a common law doc-trine rather than discerning the executive branch\\u2019s constitutional authority, they felt free to look to con-temporary developments in foreign law for inspiration.  In Bank Line v. United States, 163 F.2d 133 (2d Cir. 1947), for instance, the court of appeals recommended that the district court \\u201cconsider the views of the Eng-lish House of Lords recently expressed . . . in Duncan v. Cammell, Laird & Co., (1942) A.C. 624, when dis-cussing the nature of the privilege to withhold produc-tion of official documents on grounds of public inter-est.\\u201d  Bank Line, 163 F.2d at 139. \\n13 Moreover, even when the government raised con-stitutional arguments in support of nondisclosure, it did not base these arguments on the president\\u2019s mili-tary or foreign affairs powers under Article II.  Rather, the government simply claimed a broad executive priv-ilege to withhold information of any kind from the other branches.  See O\\u2019Neill, 79 F. Supp. at 830 (de-scribing the attorney general\\u2019s argument that under the separation of powers he was \\u201cfree to refuse disclo-sure of any evidence in his possession, regardless of its character, for any reason which may seem to him suffi-cient\\u201d (emphasis added)); United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462, 469 (1951) (describing the at-torney general\\u2019s assertion of \\u201ca determinative power as to whether or on what conditions . . . he may refuse to produce government papers under his charge\\u201d); 25 Op. Att\\u2019y Gen. 326, 331 (1905) (advising a department head that he could decline to furnish records of his de-partment \\u201cwhenever in your judgment the production of such papers . . . might prove prejudicial for any rea-son to the Government or to the public interest\\u201d). Significantly, too, courts that recognized a state secrets privilege in this era saw no tension between that privilege and a judge\\u2019s in camera review of the materials alleged to be privileged.  See Cresmer v. United States, 9 F.R.D. 203, 204 (E.D.N.Y. 1949) (\\u201c[T]o make sure that the report in question contained no military or service secrets which would be detrimental to the interests of the armed forces of the United States or to the National security, I requested counsel to produce the report for my examination.\\u201d). \\n14 C. The standards governing the state secrets privilege were borrowed, as a matter of federal common law, from contemporary developments in the United Kingdom. In United States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1 (1953), this Court confirmed the existence of a state secrets privilege in the common law of evidence and for the first time established standards to govern the admin-istration of the privilege.  Those standards were im-ported nearly wholesale from contemporary case law in the United Kingdom.  This Court borrowed those standards as an exercise of federal common law au-thority without suggesting that any of them have any relationship to the separation of powers or the presi-dent\\u2019s Article II authority. Reynolds was a dispute \\u201cabout the admission of ev-idence,\\u201d Gen. Dynamics, 563 U.S. at 485, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Those rules author-ized discovery only of materials \\u201cnot privileged,\\u201d which this Court construed as referring \\u201cto \\u2018privileges\\u2019 as that term is understood in the law of evidence.\\u201d  Reynolds, 345 U.S. at 6.  \\u201cAt the time, Congress had not yet ap-proved the Federal Rules of Evidence, and therefore the only \\u2018law of evidence\\u2019 to apply in federal court was an amalgam of common law, local practice and statu-tory provisions with indefinite contours.\\u201d  In re NSA Telecommunications Recs. Litig., 564 F. Supp. 2d 1109, 1123 (N.D. Cal. 2008).  Citing treatises and some of the limited American precedent available, this Court con-firmed that a privilege against revealing military and state secrets was \\u201cwell established in the law of evi-dence.\\u201d  Reynolds, 345 U.S. at 6-7. Beyond merely recognizing the existence of such a privilege, Reynolds fleshed out its contours and \\u201cadopted for the first time a methodology\\u201d for \\n15 administering it.  Trenga, supra, at 13.  That guidance was sorely needed because, as this Court observed, \\u201c[j]udicial experience with the privilege\\u201d had \\u201cbeen limited in this country.\\u201d  Reynolds, 345 U.S. at 7. In confirming the existence of a state secrets priv-ilege and defining its scope, this Court did not draw on Article II, the separation of powers, or any other con-stitutional principles concerning executive authority.  Reynolds was explicit on this point: The government asserted a \\u201cpower to suppress documents\\u201d based on \\u201can inherent executive power which is protected in the constitutional system of separation of power.\\u201d  Id. at 6 n.9.  But this Court disclaimed any reliance on consti-tutional considerations, finding it \\u201cunnecessary to pass upon\\u201d these \\u201cbroad propositions.\\u201d  Id. at 6.  In-stead, Reynolds \\u201cdecided a purely evidentiary dispute by applying evidentiary rules.\\u201d  Gen. Dynamics, 563 U.S. at 485.2 Having expressly \\u201cdeclined to address the consti-tutional question\\u201d raised by the government, Reynolds simply \\u201cinterpreted and applied federal common law.\\u201d  In re NSA, 564 F. Supp. 2d at 1123.  But with \\u201clittle domestic doctrine to rely upon,\\u201d Setty, supra, at 226-27, this Court sketched the outlines of the state secrets privilege by turning to foreign law\\u2014specifically, con-temporary standards in the United Kingdom.  \\u201cEng-lish experience has been more extensive,\\u201d this Court explained, and \\u201cthe principles which control the appli-cation of the privilege emerge quite clearly from the available precedents.\\u201d  Reynolds, 345 U.S. at 7; see Wil-liam G. Weaver & Robert M. Pallitto, State Secrets and  2 Reynolds did draw on constitutional principles, but not con-cerning Article II or the separation of powers.  See 345 U.S. at 8 (analogizing to the privilege against self-incrimination secured by the Fifth Amendment). \\n16 Executive Power, 120 Pol. Sci. Q. 85, 97 (2005) (while American decisions had begun to distinguish the state secrets privilege from various forms of executive priv-ilege, \\u201ccase law in the United States proved too thin a resource to fully explain this distinction, and so [this] Court turned to the law of the United Kingdom and the development of the doctrine of \\u2018crown privilege\\u2019\\u201d).   Significantly, among the principles that Reynolds borrowed from abroad was a cautious stance toward in camera judicial review of materials alleged to be privileged\\u2014an attitude not previously found in Amer-ican state secrets jurisprudence.  Two English deci-sions, \\u201cone in the 1860s and the other in the 1940s,\\u201d were \\u201cdecisive\\u201d in entrenching this principle in Eng-land, \\u201claying the groundwork for the parameters of the U.S. state secrets privilege as laid out in Reynolds.\\u201d  Setty, supra, at 228.   First, Beatson v. Skene held that when the head of a department \\u201cstates that in his opinion the production of the document would be injurious to the public ser-vice, . . . the Judge ought not to compel the production of it.\\u201d  157 Eng. Rep. 1415, 1421-22 (Exch. Div. 1860).  Notably, \\u201c[t]he court in Beatson reasoned that a con-trary approach ordinarily would not be possible be-cause, it believed, a judicial inspection \\u2018cannot take place in private\\u2019 and thus necessarily would entail public exposure of the matter in issue.\\u201d  Chesney, su-pra, at 1280 (quoting Beatson, 157 Eng. Rep. at 1421). That principle was fortified in Duncan v. Cammell, Laird & Co., [1942] A.C. 624 (H.L.), in which the House of Lords essentially ruled that \\u201cif a government officer offers a good faith affidavit as to the need for nondisclosure,\\u201d it should be accepted \\u201cat face value.\\u201d  Setty, supra, at 228-29.  \\u201cThose who are responsible for the national security must be the sole judges of what the national security requires,\\u201d Duncan stated, \\n17 and so the \\u201capproved practice\\u201d was \\u201cto treat a Ministe-rial objection taken in proper form as conclusive,\\u201d and \\u201cthe Court should not ask to see the documents.\\u201d  Dun-can, A.C. 624 (quotation marks omitted).  While the decision to exclude documents remained \\u201cthe decision of the Judge,\\u201d a validly taken objection to production, \\u201con the ground that this would be injurious to the pub-lic interest,\\u201d was \\u201cconclusive.\\u201d  Id.   This Court largely \\u201cadopted the framework\\u201d of Duncan when setting forth the parameters of the state secrets privilege in Reynolds.  Weaver & Pallitto, su-pra, at 98; see Reynolds, 345 U.S. at 7-8 & nn.15, 20-22.  This Court made an important change, however, re-garding the one aspect of the privilege that it said \\u201cpre-sents real difficulty,\\u201d namely, the rule that a court de-termining whether the privilege applies should \\u201cdo so without forcing a disclosure of the very thing the priv-ilege is designed to protect.\\u201d  Reynolds, 345 U.S. at 8; see id. at 8 n.22 (citing Duncan for this principle).  Un-der Reynolds, an official\\u2019s assertion of the state secrets privilege is not \\u201cconclusive.\\u201d  Duncan, A.C. 624.  In-stead, drawing on judicial experience with the privi-lege against self-incrimination, this Court fashioned a \\u201clike formula of compromise,\\u201d permitting courts to re-quire a \\u201cdisclosure to the judge before the claim of priv-ilege will be accepted,\\u201d including, if necessary, a \\u201ccom-plete disclosure.\\u201d  Reynolds, 345 U.S. at 9-10. In sum, like Totten before it, Reynolds was a com-mon law decision decided on common law principles, and it derived none of its rules from the president\\u2019s Ar-ticle II responsibilities.  Exercising the traditional au-thority to carve out evidentiary privileges under fed-eral common law based on general assessments of sound public policy, this Court patterned the scope of the privilege on the model provided by contemporary law in the United Kingdom. \\n18 II. The Government Mischaracterizes the Origins and Foundation of the Privilege. A. Ambiguous episodes in the early Republic have no clear connection to the state secrets privilege. Despite the history recounted above, the govern-ment insists that \\u201c[t]he Executive\\u2019s power and duty . . . to protect state secrets\\u201d has been \\u201crecognized since the earliest years of the Republic,\\u201d Pet. Br. 2, and attempts to trace a direct line between certain episodes in the early Republic and the privilege later established in Reynolds.  That effort is unavailing.  Early judicial de-cisions did not recognize a state secrets privilege or any predecessor to it.  The government\\u2019s evidence con-sists of ambiguous dicta and an incident involving a congressional request for documents\\u2014none of which has any clear relationship to the state secrets privi-lege, much less supplies evidence of a constitutional foundation for that privilege. The \\u201cearly pronouncements\\u201d cited by the govern-ment and the dissent below \\u201cdealt with a series of evi-dentiary questions that were quite distinct from one another and which did not necessarily concern matters of a diplomatic or military nature.\\u201d  Chesney, supra, at 1270.  Focused on the confidentiality of communica-tions among government officials, not on presidential authority under Article II, these discussions are, at best, nascent expressions of a \\u201cgeneral notion of exec-utive privilege\\u201d that fail to clarify its \\u201cnature or ex-tent.\\u201d  Setty, supra, at 232; see Weaver & Pallitto, su-pra, at 96 (\\u201cuntil recently, courts did not undertake to disentangle executive privilege from the power to withhold military and state secrets from judicial pro-ceedings\\u201d). \\n19 The government points primarily to statements made by Chief Justice Marshall while presiding over Aaron Burr\\u2019s treason trial, in which the defense sought a letter discussing Burr that a U.S. general had sent to President Jefferson.  See United States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 187, 190 (C.C.D. Va. 1807).  According to the government, Marshall acknowledged a need for judi-cial deference to \\u201cthe President\\u2019s judgment that, in re-sponse to a trial subpoena, the public interest required that certain documents \\u2018be kept secret.\\u2019\\u201d  Pet. Br. 3 (quoting Burr, 25 F. Cas. at 192).  But the government mischaracterizes Marshall\\u2019s statements.   Contrary to the government\\u2019s intimation, Jeffer-son \\u201cdid not attempt to withhold any documents from production to the court.\\u201d  Setty, supra, at 232-33.  Ra-ther, prosecutor George Hay \\u201csaid he had that letter, and would produce it,\\u201d but that \\u201csome matters\\u201d dis-cussed in the letter \\u201cought not to be made public.\\u201d  Burr, 25 F. Cas. at 190 (emphasis added); see id. (ob-jecting to \\u201cpublic inspection\\u201d of these passages).  Nota-bly, Hay \\u201cwas willing to put them in the hands of the clerk confidentially\\u201d to \\u201ccopy all those parts which had relation to the cause,\\u201d and suggested that \\u201cif there should be any difference of opinion as to what were confidential passages, the court should decide.\\u201d  Id. (emphasis added).   Marshall approved a subpoena duces tecum for the letter, and Hay produced it, \\u201cexcepting such parts\\u201d as were, in his view, \\u201cnot material\\u201d to the defense or the issues involved.  Id.  The government \\u201cwas not resist-ing production on the ground that disclosure of the doc-ument would endanger the public safety,\\u201d Chesney, su-pra, at 1272 (quotation marks omitted), but rather be-cause portions of the letter were \\u201cconfidential,\\u201d Burr, 25 F. Cas. at 190.  And crucially, Hay had no objection to allowing the court to view the entire letter to \\n20 confirm that the passages in question were not mate-rial: \\u201cThe accuracy of this opinion I am willing to refer to the judgment of the court, by submitting the original letter to its inspection.\\u201d  Id. (emphasis added).  Thus, \\u201cthe Government was perfectly willing to leave it to the court to determine whether portions of the letter were in fact privileged.  It insisted only that the portions so adjudged should be withheld from the defendant.\\u201d  Ra-oul Berger & Abe Krash, Government Immunity from Discovery, 59 Yale L.J. 1451, 1458 (1950).   This was the context for Marshall\\u2019s statement re-lied on here by the government: \\u201cHad the president, when he transmitted [the letter], subjected it to cer-tain restrictions, and stated that in his judgment the public interest required certain parts of it to be kept secret, and had accordingly made a reservation of them, all proper respect would have been paid to it,\\u201d Marshall observed, \\u201cbut he has made no such reserva-tion.\\u201d  Burr, 25 F. Cas. at 192.  Marshall did not elab-orate on what \\u201cproper respect\\u201d would have entailed, and his focus, like the prosecutor\\u2019s, was on public dis-closure: In regard to the secrecy of these parts which it is stated are improper to give out to the world, the court will take any order that may be nec-essary.  I do not think that the accused ought to be prohibited from seeing the letter; but, if it should be thought proper, I will order that no copy of it be taken for public exhibition . . . .  After the accused has seen it, it will yet be a question whether it shall go to the jury or not. Id. (emphasis added).  The government \\u201cproduce[d] the letter under the restrictions suggested by the court,\\u201d id. at 192-93, and ultimately the evidentiary dispute \\u201cbecame moot, sparing Marshall the need to take a \\n21 firm stand with respect to privilege issues,\\u201d Chesney, supra, at 1272-73. In short, Burr does not evince any understanding in the early Republic that executive branch officials could withhold materials from review by the courts on national security grounds, much less suggest a consti-tutional pedigree for the modern state secrets privi-lege.  The government\\u2019s objections in Burr did not clearly relate to military or diplomatic secrets, and constitutional principles were not invoked.  Most im-portantly, no one raised any objection to judicial re-view of the allegedly immaterial passages in the dis-puted letter\\u2014not the prosecutor, not Jefferson, and not Marshall.  To the extent that Burr sheds any light on the present controversy, therefore, it supports the position of Respondents, not the government: the as-sumption shared by all was that court review would remain available even if particular information could not be disclosed publicly.    The dissent below cites Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803), to similar ends, pointing to a trial colloquy in that case as evidence that \\u201cthe Judiciary has long recognized an executive privilege over sensi-tive information.\\u201d  Pet. App. 116a (Bumatay, J., dis-senting from the denial of rehearing en banc).  But that exchange has nothing to do with state secrets.   At trial in Marbury, the attorney general claimed \\u201cthat he was not bound . . . to answer, as to any facts which came officially to his knowledge while acting as secretary of state.\\u201d  5 U.S. at 143; id. at 144 (\\u201cHe did not think himself bound to disclose his official transac-tions while acting as secretary of state.\\u201d).  Although Chief Justice Marshall had \\u201cno doubt he ought to an-swer\\u201d the questions put to him, because \\u201c[t]here was nothing confidential required to be disclosed,\\u201d Mar-shall also suggested that \\u201cif he thought that any thing \\n22 was communicated to him in confidence he was not bound to disclose it.\\u201d  Id. at 144. \\u201cThe Marbury dicta raised more questions than it answered.\\u201d  Chesney, supra, at 1272.  \\u201cDid the Court mean to suggest that confidential communications to executive branch officials are privileged,\\u201d and if so, \\u201cwas the basis for protection rooted in the common law of evidence, in constitutional considerations associated with the independence of the executive branch, or both?\\u201d  Id.  \\u201cOr was the point to suggest that courts lack the capacity to subject a cabinet official to judicial process . . . ?\\u201d  Id.   There is no way of knowing.  And regardless, the exchange did not involve any claim of authority to withhold state secrets from the judiciary on the basis of the president\\u2019s Article II authority over military and foreign affairs.  Instead, this episode and the one in Burr are \\u201cbest thought of\\u201d as pertaining to the \\u201cdelib-erative process privilege,\\u201d id. at 1274, or simply to an early conception of executive privilege more generally, see Trenga, supra, at 11 n.21.  Neither case is clearly related to the modern state secrets privilege, much less suggests that the privilege is grounded in the Con-stitution.3 With no other judicial sources of even arguable rel-evance, the government cites President Washington\\u2019s response to a legislative request for documents con-cerning the disastrous St. Clair expedition.  Pet. Br. 2; see Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP, 140 S. Ct. 2019, 2029- 3 Notably, Greenleaf\\u2019s mid-nineteenth-century treatise cited Burr and Marbury only in regard to protecting the confidentiality of communications among government officials, a privilege en-joyed by state as well as federal officers.  See Greenleaf, supra, at 329.  The American editor of Starkie\\u2019s treatise cited those opin-ions (only) for the same point.  See Starkie, supra, at 71 n.1. \\n23 30 (2020).  But this episode has even less to do with the state secrets privilege than the discussions in Mar-bury and Burr.   Upon receiving this congressional request, Wash-ington\\u2019s cabinet concluded\\u2014relying primarily on prec-edents from the English House of Commons\\u2014that presidents could withhold documents from Congress \\u201cthe disclosure of which would injure the public.\\u201d  1 The Writings of Thomas Jefferson 304 (Andrew Lip-scomb ed., 1903).  But despite affirming, in theory, this right to withhold documents from Congress, the cabi-net \\u201cagreed in this case, that there was not a paper which might not be properly produced.\\u201d  Id. at 305; see 20 Op. O.L.C. 253, 270 (1996) (\\u201c[T]he cabinet further advised President Washington that the documents in question could all be disclosed consistently with the public interest.\\u201d).   This episode did not concern privileges from dis-closure in judicial proceedings, much less the question of when judges can or should compel disclosure of con-tested materials in camera.  Moreover, there is no rec-ord of the basis for the position taken by Washington\\u2019s cabinet, beyond the vague public-interest rationale quoted above.  And although Congress, upon learning of the administration\\u2019s position, issued a new request asking only for papers \\u201cof a public nature,\\u201d 20 Op. O.L.C. at 270, the import of that change was also \\u201cam-biguous,\\u201d id. at 270 n.54 (quoting Abraham D. Sofaer, War, Foreign Affairs and Constitutional Power 82-83 (1976)).   In short, the St. Clair incident\\u2014flush with ambi-guity and fundamentally involving the interplay be-tween the political branches, see Mazars, 140 S. Ct. at 2031\\u2014offers paltry support for the notion that the state secrets privilege is \\u201ca longstanding feature of our \\n24 legal system\\u201d with \\u201ca firm foundation in the Constitu-tion.\\u201d  Pet. Br. 42, 45 (quotation marks omitted). B. Any relationship between Article II and the state secrets privilege remains undefined.   Since Reynolds, this Court has hinted that Arti-cle II may call for some version of a state secrets priv-ilege, given the president\\u2019s responsibilities in military and diplomatic affairs.  But none of the features of the privilege that actually exists has ever been linked to any constitutional imperatives.   Reynolds is still \\u201cthe only instance in which [this] Court has articulated a standard for the state secrets privilege.\\u201d  Setty, supra, at 208.  Comments made in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974), however, may provide \\u201cindirect support\\u201d for the idea that a priv-ilege against disclosing military and state secrets im-plicates presidential authority under the Constitution.  Chesney, supra, at 1294.  In rejecting President Nixon\\u2019s broad and undifferentiated claim of executive privilege, this Court implied that it might have ac-corded greater protection to his \\u201cinterest in confidenti-ality\\u201d in his \\u201cPresidential communications\\u201d if they had concerned \\u201cmilitary or diplomatic secrets.\\u201d  Nixon, 418 U.S. at 706, 711.  More generally, this Court stated that \\u201cto the extent\\u201d that an interest in confidentiality \\u201crelates to the effective discharge of a President\\u2019s pow-ers, it is constitutionally based.\\u201d  Id. at 711.  At the same time, however, this Court endorsed in camera ju-dicial review of subpoenaed presidential materials to excise any portions that might be privileged under Reynolds.  See id. at 715 n.21.   \\u201cNixon was not, of course, a state secrets privilege case,\\u201d and its allusion to the possibility of a different result if military or diplomatic matters had been \\n25 involved was dicta.  Chesney, supra, at 1294.  Still, this Court\\u2019s comments may suggest that some form of a state secrets privilege could be constitutionally com-pelled\\u2014at least with respect to \\u201cconfidential conversa-tions between a President and his close advisors.\\u201d  Nixon, 418 U.S. at 703.  \\u201cPlainly, however,\\u201d any such constitutional core \\u201cdoes not account for the full scope of the privilege as it has come to be understood.\\u201d  Chesney, supra, at 1309.  As discussed, the substan-tive and procedural standards that actually comprise the privilege did not result from an analysis of the Con-stitution.  Rather, they were imported from abroad and adopted in common law fashion without any con-sideration of Article II or the separation of powers. To assert that the state secrets privilege performs \\u201ca function of constitutional significance,\\u201d therefore, Pet. Br. 45 (quoting El-Masri v. United States, 479 F.3d 296, 304 (4th Cir. 2007)), is not so much wrong as it is misleading in its artful construction.  The ability to conceal information concerning national security may indeed make it easier for the executive branch to pursue the goals it has set in the realms of military or foreign affairs.  In that sense, any state secrets privi-lege adopted by the courts, whatever its scope or ra-tionale, would have \\u201cconstitutional significance.\\u201d  Id.  But it is a leap to jump from that observation to the conclusion that the state secrets privilege as we know it\\u2014fashioned in Reynolds as a matter of federal com-mon law\\u2014has \\u201ca firm foundation in the Constitution.\\u201d  Id. (quoting El-Masri, 479 F.3d at 304).  The history of the privilege belies that assertion. \\n26 III. Because the Question Here Implicates the Powers of All Three Branches of Government, the Analysis Should Not Be Slanted in Favor of the Executive.     Tipping the interpretive scales in the executive branch\\u2019s favor is inappropriate here for an additional reason: the state secrets privilege affects the constitu-tional powers of all three branches of government. \\u201cThe Constitution gives Congress near-plenary power to decide which kinds of Article III cases and controversies federal courts shall hear,\\u201d and the dis-missal of lawsuits as a result of the state secrets priv-ilege therefore \\u201cintrudes not just on the power of courts and the rights of individuals, but on the jurisdiction-conferring authority of the legislature as well.\\u201d  Amanda Frost, The State Secrets Privilege and Sepa-ration of Powers, 75 Fordham L. Rev. 1931, 1932 (2007); see In re United States, 872 F.2d 472, 477 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (\\u201c[D]enial of the forum provided under the Constitution for the resolution of disputes, U.S. Const. art. III, \\u00a7 2, is a drastic remedy . . . .\\u201d).  Further, when the executive branch uses the state secrets privilege \\u201cto obtain dismissals of suits alleging government misconduct or unconstitutional behavior,\\u201d it \\u201craises special concerns relating to democratic ac-countability and the rule of law.\\u201d  Chesney, supra, at 1308.  While the judiciary has no \\u201croving writ to ferret out and strike down executive excess,\\u201d El-Masri, 479 F.3d at 312, the Framers intended that in resolving \\u201cCases\\u201d and \\u201cControversies,\\u201d U.S. Const. art. III, \\u00a7 2, cl. 1, and \\u201cdecid[ing] on the rights of individuals,\\u201d Mar-bury, 5 U.S. at 170, the federal courts would rein in unlawful abuses by the executive branch, preserving the rights secured by federal law \\u201cfrom all violation from every quarter,\\u201d Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. 264, 388 (1821); see 1 Annals of Cong. 457 (1789) (Joseph \\n27 Gales ed., 1834) (James Madison) (\\u201cindependent tribu-nals of justice will consider themselves in a peculiar manner the guardians of those rights; they will be an impenetrable bulwark against every assumption of power in the legislative or executive\\u201d); The Federalist No. 78, at 466 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961) (\\u201cWithout this, all the reservations of partic-ular rights or privileges would amount to nothing.\\u201d).   Critically, too, \\u201cpower over national security infor-mation does not rest solely with the president.\\u201d  In re NSA, 564 F. Supp. 2d at 1120-21.  Instead, \\u201cdecisions as to foreign policy . . . . are wholly confided by our Constitution to the political departments of the govern-ment, Executive and Legislative.\\u201d  Chicago & S. Air Lines v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 111 (1948) (emphasis added).  So too for decisions concerning mil-itary policy.  See Martin v. Mott, 25 U.S. 19, 28-29 (1827).  Indeed, Congress, not the president, is the \\u201cfi-nal arbiter of military and diplomatic policy.\\u201d  James Zagel, The State Secrets Privilege, 50 Minn. L. Rev. 875, 896 (1966); see id. at 896 n.82 (\\u201cThe presidential powers over treaties and the armed forces are subject either to outright congressional veto or to implied veto by virtue of Congress\\u2019 control over appointments and appropriations.\\u201d). In line with this constitutional structure, Congress has empowered the judiciary \\u201cto hear cases in which executive power is challenged\\u201d by giving it \\u201cbroad fed-eral question jurisdiction, and by enacting specific statutory limits on executive power in the area of na-tional security, such as in the Foreign Intelligence Sur-veillance Act.\\u201d  Frost, supra, at 1954-55.  When the state secrets privilege restricts the breadth of that ju-risdiction and the effectiveness of those limits, it af-fects the constitutional roles of Congress and the fed-eral courts. \\n28 Thus, when the question is whether a statute en-acted by the legislature permits the judiciary to adju-dicate allegations that the executive has violated the law, the answer implicates the constitutional powers of all three branches of government.  Skewing that statutory analysis in favor of the executive is unwar-ranted. * * * In sum, there is no justification for distorting the normal approach to statutory interpretation here by demanding a showing \\u201cthat Congress was unmistaka-bly clear,\\u201d Pet. Br. 16 (quoting Pet. App. 110a), when it displaced the state secrets privilege in FISA.  This Court should do what it normally does: interpret the statute to discern its meaning. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed. Respectfully submitted,  ELIZABETH B. WYDRA BRIANNE J. GOROD* BRIAN R.

EPIC routinely participates as amicus curiae before this Court and other courts in cases concern-ing privacy issues, new technologies, and constitu-tional interests. See, e.g., Carpenter v. United States, No. 16-402 (2017) (arguing that the Fourth Amend-ment protects the right against warrantless seizure and search of location data); State v. Earls, 214 N.J. 564 (2013) (same); Packingham v. North Carolina, 137 S. Ct. 1730 (2017) (arguing that the First Amendment protects the right to access speech from the privacy of a personal electronic device); Utah v. Streiff, 136 S. Ct. 2056 (2016) (arguing that evidence obtained via suspicionless identification should be suppressed); Riley v. California, 134 S. Ct. 2473 (2014) (arguing that it is unreasonable to warrant-lessly search a cell phone incident to an arrest); Flor-ida v. Harris, 133 S. Ct. 1050 (2013) (arguing that the government bears the burden of establishing the reliability of new investigative techniques used in es-tablishing probable cause for a search); United States                                                 1 Both parties consent to the filing of this brief. In accord-ance with Rule 37.6, the undersigned states that no mone-tary contributions were made for the preparation or sub-mission of this brief, and this brief was not authored, in whole or in part, by counsel for a party. \\n2 \\n v. Jones, 565 U.S. 400 (2012) (arguing that warrant-less tracking of a car using a GPS device violates the Fourth Amendment); Commonwealth v. Connolly, 454 Mass. 808 (2009) (same). EPIC seeks to ensure that the statutory pro-tections established by Congress to safeguard privacy are fully enforced by the courts. This case presents a fundamental question about the obligation of the courts to comply with the plain text of 18 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2518(10)(a), the suppression remedy for an inter-ception that is unlawful, supported by insufficient authorization, or not in conformity with authoriza-tion or approval. EPIC submits this amicus brief in support of petitioners. SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT In recent years, this Court has considered sev-eral important privacy cases, arising from new tech-nologies, that present important constitutional ques-tions. This is not such a case. This case is about the authority of Congress to enact statutes to safeguard privacy. The suppression and exclusion provisions in the Wiretap Act, 18 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2515, 2518(10), are broad and unambiguous, and it is the responsibility of the courts to ensure they are enforced. Congress has made clear that wiretap orders cannot authorize surveillance beyond a court\\u2019s jurisdictional boundary. Any order that does is facially invalid and triggers suppression of evidence under the plain text of \\u00a7 2518(10). If the government wishes a different out-come, then it should go to Congress to revise the statute. It is not for the Court to undo the statutory provisions. \\n3 \\n The Wiretap Act was enacted by Congress in 1968 to respond to this Court\\u2019s rulings in Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41 (1967), and Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967). The purpose of the Act is to protect the privacy of communications, to strictly limit unauthorized and unlawful interception, and to ensure meaningful enforcement of statutory rights. Congress has subsequently amended the Wiretap Act on several occasions, and may choose to do so again to provide, for example, specific rules governing cell phone location information. But it is not for the courts to create atextual exceptions to the suppres-sion and exclusion provisions in the Wiretap Act. The lower court\\u2019s decision should be overturned. ARGUMENT I. Congress enacted broad and unambigu-ous suppression and exclusion provisions in the Wiretap Act to minimize unlawful or unauthorized surveillance and to en-sure compliance with the Act. The provisions for exclusion and suppression in Sections 2515 and 2518 are \\u201cintegral\\u201d to the priva-cy regime established in the Wiretap Act. S. Rep. 90-1097, at 96 (1968), as reprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2112, 2185 [\\u201cSenate Committee Report\\u201d]. The statu-tory provisions are intended to minimize unlawful or unauthorized interception and ensure compliance with the Act. There is no basis in the text, history, or purpose of the Wiretap Act for judicially manufac-tured limitations on the law\\u2019s unambiguous provi-sions. In the privacy realm, the Court appropriately determines the bounds of the Fourth Amendment. But the Court should leave it to Congress to make changes to privacy protections established by statute. \\n4 \\n The \\u201ccore purpose\\u201d of the Wiretap Act is to strictly limit unlawful or unauthorized interception and to \\u201cprotect the privacy of individuals by banning eavesdropping other than by duly authorized law en-forcement officers who complied with the safeguards provided by the law.\\u201d Edith J. Lapidus, Eavesdrop-ping on Trial 7 (1974). The law accomplishes this in three distinct ways: (1) by generally prohibiting un-authorized interception and providing for civil reme-dies, 18 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2511, 2520; (2) by criminally sanc-tioning both unlawful interception and the facilita-tion of unlawful interception through manufacture and distribution of \\u201cintercepting devices,\\u201d 18 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2511, 2512; and (3) by establishing specific proce-dures that courts and law enforcement officers must follow in order to be authorized to intercept commu-nications in criminal investigations, 18 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2516\\u201318. In order to ensure that these rules would be enforced, Congress provided a full range of remedies: damages, criminal penalties, injunctive relief, and suppression of evidence derived from an unlawful or unauthorized interception. Congress also established an extensive reporting scheme to facilitate public oversight of the use of Wiretap authority. 18 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2519. See generally EPIC, Wiretapping (2017).2 Congress made clear from the outset that the exclusionary rule is essential to the Wiretap Act\\u2019s ro-bust privacy protections and therefore should not be limited. The Senate Judiciary Committee described the broad exclusionary provision in \\u00a7 2515 as \\u201cneces-sary and proper to protect privacy\\u201d and \\u201can integral part of the system of limitations designed to protect privacy.\\u201d Senate Committee Report, supra, at 96. Pri-                                                2 https://epic.org/privacy/wiretap/. \\n5 \\n or to 1968, the idea of authorizing interception of pri-vate communications was so controversial that Con-gress failed repeatedly to pass any statutes authoriz-ing wiretapping. See Edward V. Long, The Intruders 153\\u201354 (1967); Lapidus, supra, at 11. Congress intended section 2518(10)(a)\\u2014the provision that provides standing to file a motion to suppress\\u2014to provide \\u201cthe remedy for the right creat-ed by section 2515.\\u201d Senate Committee Report, supra at 106. The Senate Committee Report cautioned that \\u201c[o]nly by striking at all aspects of the problem can privacy be adequately protected.\\u201d Id. at 69. Accord-ingly, the law provides for criminal, civil, and eviden-tiary remedies. Id. These three remedies were in-tended \\u201cto guarantee that the standards of the new chapter will sharply curtail the unlawful interception of wire and oral communications.\\u201d Id. at 96.  Congress also intended the exclusionary rule to be a sanction for those law enforcement officers that engaged in unlawful wiretapping. The report de-scribes section 2515\\u2019s exclusionary rule as an \\u201cevi-dentiary sanction.\\u201d Id. The Senate report also states that the \\u201cperpetrator must be denied the fruits of his unlawful action in civil and criminal proceedings.\\u201d Id. at 69. This indicates that Congress intended the pro-vision to have a deterrent effect on officers, prevent-ing future unlawful wiretapping. These strict limita-tions on the use of wiretap evidence are consistent with the law that existed post-Olmstead. See Samuel Dash, The Eavesdroppers 387\\u2013400 (1959) (discussing Section 605 of the Federal Communications Act and the early post-Olmstead cases interpreting the exclu-sionary rule). \\n6 \\n When Congress ultimately adopted sections 2515 and 2518(10), it used unambiguous language that prohibits the use of evidence obtained in viola-tion of Title III; those provisions should be applied broadly and without exception. The Senate indicated \\u201cthat all unauthorized interception of such communi-cation should be prohibited, as well as the use of the contents of unauthorized interceptions as evidence in courts and administrative hearings.\\u201d Senate Commit-tee Report, supra, at 89 [emphasis added]. Indeed, the only limitation on the broad exclusionary rule is the requirement that the movant be an \\u201caggrieved person\\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2510(11). As the Senate Committee Report explained, they did not intend \\u201cto change the general rule\\u201d governing grand jury pro-ceedings or \\u201cto grant jurisdiction to Federal courts over Congress itself,\\u201d but provided that \\u201c[o]therwise the scope of the provision is intended to be compre-hensive.\\u201d Senate Committee Report, supra, at 106. Judicially crafted exceptions to the exclusionary rule on the basis of a change in technology would be in-consistent with this intent for a comprehensive scope.  The meaning of the exclusion and suppression provisions in the Wiretap Act are also informed by the cases that preceded their adoption. Although members of the Court have subsequently disagreed over the scope of the constitutional exclusionary rule, the statutory rule in the Wiretap Act should be inter-preted based on both its text and the law as it existed in 1968. In the decade leading up to the Act\\u2019s pas-sage, the Court in Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961), established that \\u201cthe exclusionary rule is an essential part of both the Fourth and Fourteenth Amend-ments.\\u201d Mapp, 367 U.S. at 657. Justice Black\\u2019s con-curring opinion in Mapp noted that \\u201cwhen the Fourth \\n7 \\n Amendment's ban against unreasonable searches and seizures is considered together with the Fifth Amendment's ban against compelled self-incrimination, a constitutional basis emerges which not only justifies but actually requires the exclusion-ary rule.\\u201d Id. at 662 (Black, J., concurring). The Court had previously recognized this right as stemming from a combination of Fourth and Fifth Amendment protections. See Agnello v. United States, 269 U.S. 20, 33\\u201334 (1925) (\\u201cIt is well settled that, when properly invoked, the Fifth Amendment protects every person from incrimination by the use of evidence obtained through search or seizure made in violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment.\\u201d). As Justice Stewart explained in his seminal lecture, the exclusionary rule serves an important de-terrent function that is not matched by other reme-dies\\u2014criminal prosecutions, injunctions, and civil damages\\u2014which have a limited application in the law enforcement context. See Potter Stewart, The Road to Mapp v. Ohio and Beyond: The Origins, De-velopment and Future of the Exclusionary Rule in Search-and-Seizure Cases, 83 Colum. L. Rev. 1365, 1386\\u201389 (1983). Criminal prosecutions are seen as a severe penalty for law enforcement officers, and thus are limited to \\u201cwillful\\u201d violations. Id. at 1386. Injunc-tions require proof of widespread constitutional viola-tions to establish likelihood of a future violation. Id. at 1389. And civil damages are both expensive to pursue and difficult to prove due to deference given to law enforcement officers. Id. at 1387\\u201388. Justice Stewart, writing for the Court in Elkins v. United States, 364 U.S. 206 (1960), found that the exclusionary rule \\u201ccompel[s] respect for the \\n8 \\n constitutional guaranty in the only effectively availa-ble way\\u2014by removing the incentive to disregard it.\\u201d Elkins, 364 U.S. at 217. The exclusionary rule is con-stitutionally required not as a right \\u201cbut as a remedy necessary to ensure that those prohibitions are ob-served in fact.\\u201d Stewart, supra, at 1380. Whether the exclusionary rule is understood as a right enshrined in the Constitution or as a remedy that is constitu-tionally required to make the Fourth Amendment meaningful in practice, it was well established by 1968 that an exclusionary remedy was necessary to preserve privacy.  Congress enacted the broad exclusionary rule in the Wiretap Act following the expansion of the remedy in Mapp v. Ohio and prior to any of the sub-sequent limitations imposed in the constitutional context. After Elkins, Mapp, and Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), the broad scope and application of the suppression remedy was solidified. That is the broad principle that Congress embraced in Title III. As Professor Murphy explained, \\u201cthe exclusionary rule was effectively mandated as regards Title III, because Katz v. United States and Berger v. New York had already made it clear that improper wiretapping violated the Constitution.\\u201d Erin Murphy, The Politics of Privacy in the Criminal Justice System: Infor-mation Disclosure, the Fourth Amendment, and Stat-utory Law Enforcement Exemptions, 111 Mich. L. Rev. 485, 522 (2013). The Court has had occasion since that time to qualify somewhat the availability of exclusion as a pure constitutional remedy. See Aziz Z. Huq, Judicial Independence and the Rationing of Constitutional Remedies, 65 Duke L.J. 1, 17\\u201320 (2015). But it is not necessary to impose new limits or qualifications on \\n9 \\n the statutory remedy in the Wiretap Act, which have been clearly set out by Congress. Title III is not the only statute where Congress has chosen to create a suppression remedy. In the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988, 18 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2710, Congress also enacted a broad and unambig-uous exclusionary rule like the one in the Wiretap Act.  Personally identifiable information ob-tained in any manner other than as pro-vided in this section shall not be re-ceived in evidence in any trial, hearing, arbitration, or other proceeding in or be-fore any court, grand jury, department, officer, agency, regulatory body, legisla-tive committee, or other authority of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State. 18 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2710(d). See Murphy, supra, at 522\\u201326. It would raise substantial separation of powers concerns for the courts to narrow Congress\\u2019 authority to enact statutory suppression remedies based on a judicial determination as to the statute\\u2019s \\u201ccore\\u201d pur-pose where there is no support in the text or history of the Act to reach such a result. II. Where Congress has provided a broad and unambiguous suppression remedy, courts should not create atextual excep-tions.  The Wiretap Act provides detailed rules that limit the government\\u2019s ability to intercept private communications. Congress has since updated the law to carry forward the purpose of the 1968 Act and to reflect significant changes in the technology. As Jus-\\n10 \\n tice Alito has explained, \\u201cIn circumstances involving dramatic technological change, the best solution to privacy concerns may be legislative. A legislative body is well situated to gauge changing public atti-tudes, to draw detailed lines, and to balance privacy and public safety in a comprehensive way.\\u201d United States v. Jones, 565 U.S. 400, 427\\u201328 (2012) (Alito, J., concurring) (internal citations omitted). This process of technological refinement in statutory privacy law, where Congress defines protections and courts apply those definitions to emerging technologies, is ongoing and important. Congress also has the ability to conduct de-tailed fact-finding and develop clear rules set out in public law. Professors Gray and Citron write, \\u201cthe law enforcement and privacy interests at stake can be explored in a more expansive and timely manner in the context of legislative or executive rule making processes than they can be in the context of constitu-tional litigation.\\u201d David Gray & Danielle Citron, The Right to Quantitative Privacy, 98 Minn. L. Rev. 62, 110 (2013). Professor Murphy has stated, \\u201cCongress has proven more adept than the courts at implement-ing mechanisms for systemic oversight of privacy practices, as well as for reform of noncompliant insti-tutions.\\u201d Murphy, supra, at 535.  Congress looks to the Court\\u2019s constitutional guidance to enact privacy legislation \\u201cthat draws rea-sonable distinctions based on categories of infor-mation or [] other variables.\\u201d Riley v. California, 134 S. Ct. 2473, 2497 (2014) (Alito, J., concurring). As Justice Alito explained in Riley, \\u201cThe regulation of electronic surveillance provides an instructive exam-ple\\u201d of Congress\\u2019s complementary role in defining \\n11 \\n privacy protections. Id. In 1967, the Court struck down a New York statute because it permitted elec-tronic eavesdropping \\u201cwithout requiring belief that any particular offense ha[d] been or [was] being committed\\u201d and without requiring that the \\u201cconversa-tions [sought] be particularly described.\\u201d Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41, 58-59 (1967). Later that term, the Court held that warrantless eavesdropping on a telephone booth violated the Fourth Amendment be-cause it intruded on the caller\\u2019s reasonable expecta-tion of privacy. Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 358-59 (1967); id. at 360 (Harlan, J., concurring). This Court has recognized the importance of judicial deference and treading carefully so as not to usurp the role of Congress. Chief Justice Roberts em-phasized that, \\u201cin every case we must respect the role of the Legislature, and take care not to undo what it has done.\\u201d King v. Burwell, 135 S. Ct. 2480, 2495 (2015). Justice Scalia cited Justice Brennan in cau-tioning \\u201cjudges [] to refrain from substituting their own interstitial lawmaking.\\u201d City of Arlington, Tex. v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 304\\u201305 (2013) (citing Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, 444 U.S. 555, 568 (1980)). Where Congress has gone through the effort of creat-ing a broad and unambiguous suppression remedy, as it has done in the Wiretap Act, the Court should heed deference to Congress.  Since Title III was enacted in 1968, Congress has passed several amendments to the Wiretap Act, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-508, 100 Stat. 1848 [\\u201cECPA\\u201d], and the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, Pub. L. 103-414, 108 Stat. 4279 (1994) [\\u201cCALEA\\u201d]. Congress passed ECPA to \\u201cupdate and \\n12 \\n clarify Federal privacy protections and standards in light of dramatic changes in new computer and tele-communications technologies.\\u201d S. Rep. 99-541, at 1 (1986), as reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555, 3555. Eight years later, Congress again amended the law, in part, to extend protections \\u201cto cordless phones and certain data communications transmitted by radio.\\u201d H.R. Rep. 103-827, at 10 (1994), as reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3489, 3490. In both instances, Congress made the determination that changes in technology had altered the communications landscape in a way that required legislative action. But Congress has not amended the Wiretap Act to provide for authorization of interception across jurisdictional boundaries. The district court\\u2019s attempt to do so was a direct violation of the statute, making the order facially invalid. Congress clearly knew how to provide authority for cross-jurisdictional wiretap-ping where it determined that such authorization was proper. In ECPA, Congress both extended Wire-tap Act protections to electronic communications and provided specific authority for the interception of oral communications across jurisdictional boundaries in a specific, narrow context: where law enforcement sought to use a \\u201cmobile tracking device.\\u201d 18 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2518(3).  The \\u201cmobile tracking device\\u201d provision was en-acted for a specific purpose: to enable the authoriza-tion to use \\u201ca tap\\u201d that is \\u201cinstalled on a vehicle.\\u201d S. Rep. 99-541, supra, at 30. Congress recognized that \\u201c[i]n certain cases . . . a device authorized for installa-tion in an automobile may be authorized in one dis-trict and the vehicle might be moved to another dis-trict prior to installation.\\u201d Id. Congress decided in \\n13 \\n ECPA that, with an appropriate court order, the gov-ernment has the authority to complete \\u201cinstallation in the district to which the vehicle has been moved.\\u201d Id. This is precisely the type of narrow solution to a specific problem that Congress is capable of enacting when necessary.  But if a court simply ignores the jurisdictional limitation altogether by refusing to enforce the exclu-sionary rule when it is violated, then Congress would never have the occasion to review and update the law. Indeed, it is directly contrary to Congress\\u2019 intent for the court to deny the remedy outlined in the stat-ute (suppression of evidence) even when the jurisdic-tional limitation provision was violated. Suppression of evidence acquired in violation of Title III is not op-tional, it is required under the statute. 18 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2515. Accordingly, the courts should defer to Con-gress to make any changes to the statutory scheme in response to emerging technologies, rather than adopt an atextual exemption by judicial fiat.  The Court and Congress have long worked to-gether to determine the scope of the right to privacy. Marc Rotenberg & David Brody, Protecting Privacy: The Role of the Courts and Congress, Hum. Rts., March 2013, at 7, 10. (\\u201cBoth courts and Congress share responsibility for safeguarding individuals\\u2019 pri-vacy from advancing technology and overzealous gov-ernment surveillance.\\u201d). The Wiretap Act was drafted in response to this Court\\u2019s opinions in Berger and Katz. The drafters considered the cases to be authori-tative pronouncements of the necessary procedures for constitutional wiretaps. See S. Rep. 90-1097 (1968), as reprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2112, 2153 (asserting \\u201c[i]n the course of the [Berger] Opinion the \\n14 \\n Court delineated the constitutional criteria that elec-tronic surveillance legislation should contain. Title III was drafted to meet these standards\\u201d).  In drafting Title III, Congress expressly relied on the factors that the Court set out in Berger. S. Rep. 90-1097, 73-75 (1968), as reprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2112, 2161\\u201363 (\\u201cWorking from the hy-pothesis that any wiretapping and electronic surveil-lance legislation should include . . . constitutional standards, the subcommittee has used the Berger and Katz decisions as a guide in drafting title III.\\u201d). \\u201cIt was the Court\\u2019s decision in 1967 that set the course for the modern right to privacy, but it was the con-gressional legislation the following year that gave meaning to that right.\\u201d Rotenberg & Brody, supra. It is for the Court to determine the scope of the Fourth Amendment. Congress has codified these de-cisions into statutes. Title III, for example, \\u201cauthoriz-es but imposes detailed restrictions on electronic sur-veillance.\\u201d Riley, 134 S. Ct. at 2497; see 18 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2510.  Since the enactment of the Wiretap Act, \\u201celec-tronic surveillance has been governed primarily, not by decisions of this Court, but by the statute.\\u201d Riley, 134 S. Ct. at 2497. If Congress has chosen a broad and unambiguous suppression remedy for violations of the Wiretap Act, then it is not for the courts to    create atextual exceptions.   \\n15 \\n CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, EPIC respectfully asks this Court to reverse the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.

She also has a master\\u2019s degree in bioethics and completed the National Catholic Bioethics Center ethics certificate course. In addition to her full-time clinical duties within the neonatal intensive care unit of a large regional medical center, Dr. Pierucci remains active in perinatal palliative care, and ongoing performance improvement projects.  She has multiple publications in peer and non-peer reviewed journals and has spoken around the country on multiple perinatal and ethical topics.  As an expert in caring for extremely young premature babies, Dr. Pierucci understands that medical science provides only limited ability to determine neonatal survival and that such a determination is best made by trained and experienced neonatologists, not abortion providers.  Dr. Pierucci contests the disconnect between two standards of care that are allowed under current law: the same patient that neonatologists such as herself are ethically, medically, and legally responsible to treat, obstetricians can legally abort.

Though human beings look different at different stages of development (e.g., embryo, fetus, neonate, toddler, adolescent, adult, elderly), we are always human beings. Because we are always human beings, doctors always have the obligation to provide the best care possible, and the state will always have an equal obligation to safeguard all its members. Amicus Life Legal Defense Foundation is a California non-profit 501(c)(3) public interest legal and educational organization that works to assist and support those who advocate in defense of life. Its mission is to give innocent and helpless human beings of any age, particularly unborn children, a trained and committed defense against the threat of death, and to support their advocates in the nation\\u2019s courtrooms. Life Legal Defense Foundation believes life begins at the moment of conception and does not end until natural death. We litigate cases to protect human life, from preborn babies targeted by a billion-dollar abortion industry to the elderly, disabled, and medically vulnerable denied life-sustaining care.  Life Legal Defense Foundation sees in the present case an opportunity for this Court to right a 47-year-old wrong: the stripping from states of their authority to protect the lives of innocent human beings within their borders.  SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT  The Fifth Circuit held that the State of Mississippi\\u2019s Gestational Age Act was an \\n \\t3 \\n unconstitutional ban on pre-viability abortions, based on Supreme Court precedent in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992). Cert. Pet. App.  13a. The lower court noted that, although viability \\u201cmay differ with each pregnancy\\u201d and is dependent on a variety of factors, nonetheless \\u201cviability is the critical point.\\u201d  Id. at 12a and n. 34 (quoting Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 388-89 (1979)).  Because of this Court\\u2019s precedents, the Fifth Circuit was forced to adhere to a legal framework this Court has never explained.  This Court first bestowed constitutional significance on the concept of viability in its abortion jurisprudence in 1973, at which time it stated, \\u201cViability is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks.\\u201d Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 160 (1973). Within two decades, that already generous window has shifted by several weeks.2 More importantly, as this brief will demonstrate, viability outside the womb depends on a variety of external and subjective factors, including individual physicians\\u2019 competence, continuing education in neonatal medicine, personal and institutional philosophies of the \\t\\t2 See, e.g., Isaacson v. Horne, 716 F.3d 1213, 1233 (9th Cir. 2013) (Kleinfeld, J., concurring) (\\u201cViability is the \\u2018critical fact\\u2019 that controls constitutionality. That is an odd rule, because viability changes as medicine changes. As Planned Parenthood v. Casey noted, between Roe v. Wade in 1973 and the time Casey was decided in 1992, viability dropped from 28 weeks to 23 or 24 weeks, because medical science became more effective at preserving the lives of premature babies.\\u201d)  \\n \\t4 \\n provision of life-sustaining medical interventions, and physician attitudes toward disabilities and societal challenges.  Amici join Petitioner Dobbs in urging this Court to revisit the doctrine of viability and clarify that the State\\u2019s interest in preserving the life of human beings in the womb is not contingent on the entirely unrelated question of the possible medical outcomes if the mother went into labor and delivered the child prematurely.  This Court should grant the Petition and reverse the judgment of the Fifth Circuit.  ARGUMENT  I. THE VIABILITY BENCHMARK WITH ROE CONFLICTS WITH THIS COURT\\u2019S DETERMINATION THAT THERE IS AN UNQUALIFIED COMPELLING STATE INTEREST IN PRESERVING HUMAN LIFE.   In Cruzan v. Dir., Mo. Dep't of Health, 497 U.S. 261 (1990), this Court found that the state not only has an interest in protecting an individual\\u2019s right to life, but also has \\u201can interest in life\\u201d itself. Id. at 281. This holding was consistent with the Court\\u2019s finding in Roe v. Wade that the state has an \\u201cimportant and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life.\\u201d Roe, 410 U.S. at 162.  In both cases, the state\\u2019s interest in life and in protecting human life were weighed against an \\n \\t5 \\n individual\\u2019s constitutional rights (right to due process and right to privacy, respectively).  In Roe, this Court determined that the state\\u2019s interest in the protection of human life became compelling at viability, relying on the fetus\\u2019 \\u201ccapability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb.\\u201d Id. at 163. By contrast, in Cruzan this Court rejected the idea of \\u201cmeaningful life,\\u201d holding that \\u201ca State may properly decline to make judgments about the \\u2018quality\\u2019 of life that a particular individual may enjoy, and simply assert an unqualified interest in the preservation of human life to be weighed against the constitutionally protected interests of the individual.\\u201d Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 282; Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 729 (1997) (quoting Cruzan and holding that the state \\u201chas an unqualified interest in the preservation of human life\\u201d) (emphasis added). See also Britell v. United States, 372 F.3d 1370, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (\\u201cIt is not the role of the courts to draw lines as to which fetal abnormalities or birth defects are so severe as to negate the state's otherwise legitimate interest in the fetus' potential life.\\u201d); State v. Final Exit Network, Inc., 889 N.W.2d 296, 305-06 (Minn. Ct. App. 2016) (\\u201cThe state has a compelling interest in the preservation of D.D.\\u2019s life, and the prevention of her suicide, regardless of her incurable [non-viable] condition.\\u201d)   Limiting a state\\u2019s ability to protect human lives directly to only those lives deemed \\u201cmeaningful\\u201d because the arbitrary benchmark of viability has been reached is in direct conflict with this Court\\u2019s 1990 holding in Cruzan, that a state \\n \\t6 \\n need not qualify its interest in the preservation of human life before acting.    This Court should grant the petition to resolve the conflict between its abortion jurisprudence and its decisions in Cruzan and Glucksberg allowing states to protect human life regardless of the \\u201cmeaningfulness\\u201d of that life as measured by the uncertain yardstick of viability.  II. THERE IS NO \\u201cPOINT\\u201d IN PREGNANCY AT WHICH VIABILITY \\u201cOCCURS.\\u201d   In Roe, this Court established viability as the \\u201cpoint\\u201d at which the state\\u2019s interest in protecting human life becomes compelling, allowing the state to prohibit abortion. The Court defined viable as \\u201cpotentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid.\\u201d Roe, 410 U.S. at 160. One commentator noted that, with this holding, this Court \\u201cseems to mistake a definition for a syllogism.\\u201d3 Indeed, this Court has never attempted to elaborate on why a child\\u2019s ability or inability to survive outside the womb in the case of a premature delivery has any bearing on the state\\u2019s interest in protecting the child from being killed inside the womb.  In Roe, the Court could not locate the so-called \\u201cpoint\\u201d of viability more precisely than to say that it is \\u201cusually placed about seven months (28 \\t\\t3 John Hart Ely, The Wages of Crying Wolf: A Comment on Roe v. Wade, 82 YALE L. J. 920, 924 (1973). \\n \\t7 \\n weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks.\\u201d Id. Thus, even as first enunciated by this Court, the \\u201cpoint\\u201d when viability \\u201coccurred\\u201d ranged across 10% of a full-term 40-week pregnancy.4 A few years later, this Court acknowledged that multiple factors go into the assessment of viability including \\u201cfetal weight, based on an inexact estimate of the size and condition of the uterus; the woman's general health and nutrition; the quality of the available medical facilities; and other factors.\\u201d Colautti, 439 U.S. at 395-96 (emphasis added). In other words, there is no \\u201cpoint\\u201d of viability in pregnancy generally, or even in any particular pregnancy.  It gets worse. Colautti assigned the role of assessing the viability of the fetus to the \\u201cresponsible attending physician,\\u201d i.e., the abortion provider. However, to the extent any given abortion provider has relevant5 specialized training, such training would be in obstetrics, not neonatology.  Abortion providers are unlikely to stay current on medical advancements for infant survival. The largest abortion provider networks, Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the National Abortion Federation, offer continuing \\t\\t4 Pregnancy is commonly dated from the onset of the mother\\u2019s last menstrual period (LMP), approximately two weeks before conception. All gestational ages described in this brief are dated from LMP.  5 Relevant as opposed to specialized training in, e.g., radiology or ophthalmology. Cf. June Medical Servs. L. L. C. et al. v. Russo. 2020 LEXIS 3516 at *116 (2020) (abortion provider \\u201chired a radiologist and ophthalmologist to do abortions\\u201d). \\n \\t8 \\n medical education on clinical abortion procedure but not on infant viability.6 The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology follows the same pattern, focusing its continuing education offerings related to abortion on maternal care, not infant viability.7 Neonatologists, not obstetricians, are the experts in viability.  Unsurprisingly, the presence or absence of specialized training makes a noticeable difference in how physicians practice as well. A 2015 study by the Indiana University School of Medicine found that obstetricians and neonatologists approach patient consultations in drastically different ways. Obstetricians tend to discuss topics like maternal health risks, while neonatologists focus on post-birth complications and treatment options for the \\t\\t6 Among abortion providers, infant survival is a \\u201ccomplication\\u201d to be carefully avoided.

Injecting further subjectivity into the viability calculus is the fact that a physician\\u2019s personal philosophy and attitude regarding the provision of life-sustaining medical interventions impacts the actual survival rate of an infant. Study after study throughout the world has shown that offering immediate life-sustaining treatment to preemies is the largest modifiable factor affecting infant survival.9   Compare, for example, the difference in survival rates between two American neonatal \\t\\t8 B.

Backes et al., Outcomes Following a Comprehensive Versus a Selective Approach for Infants Born at 22 Weeks of Gestation, 39 J. Perinatology 39, 45 (2019) (hospital that routinely provided prenatal corticoster-oid administration, neonatal resuscitation, and intensive care had substantially higher survival rates [53 percent] than the hospital that only selectively provided such care [8 percent]); J.

This is, at least to some degree, the result of differences in the aggressiveness of obstetrical and neonatal management at these gestational ages.\\u201d) \\n \\t10 \\n facilities that work with extremely pre-term births. At the University of Iowa, physicians default to immediate, active medical treatment for all pre-term infants starting at 22 weeks\\u2019 gestation.10 These physicians have long seen over a 60% survival rate for babies in the 22-week category. Physicians at the University directly credit their default-to-treatment strategy for the high survival rate.11 By contrast, Providence Women and Children\\u2019s Services of Oregon has a very different rate of survival for 22-week births. The physicians there have a facility-wide policy to not provide care for any 22-week births, regardless of the parents\\u2019 wishes, and thus they have a 0% survival rate. Moreover, because the success of treatment rate is also dependent on the experience of doctors, Providence has a much lower survival rate for 23-week births, as well \\u2013 only 21%, compared to the national average of 38%.12 \\t\\t10 In a 2020 publication, University of Iowa neonatologists reported they provided immediate, active medical intervention for 97% of periviable births in their facility between 2006 and 2015. For the purposes of this study, a periviable birth was defined as a birth that occurred after 21 weeks\\u2019 gestation, but before 26 weeks\\u2019 gestation.  11 Keith Barrington, Active intervention at 22 weeks\\u2019 gestation, is it futile?, Neonatal Research Blog (Oct. 29, 2018), available at https://neonatalresearch.org/2018/10/29/active-intervention -at-22-weeks-gestation-isit-futile/; P. Watkins, J. Dagle, et al., Outcomes at 18 to 22 Months of Corrected Age for Infants Born at 22 to 25 Weeks of Gestation in a Center Practicing Active Management, 217 J. Pediatrics 52 (Feb 2020). 12 Patrick J. Marmion, Periviability and the \\u2018god committee,\\u2019 106 Acta Paediatrica 857 (Jun 2017). \\n \\t11 \\n  Clearly, the willingness of a neonatologists to provide active care to a baby after birth is a large factor in the child\\u2019s chance of survival. The philosophy of defaulting against care lowers the survival rate, even for those children who do receive care. Conversely, when a facility defaults to immediate active medical intervention, survival rates of all treated neonates increase.13   The decision for or against medical care for premature babies is also shaped by attitudes toward disability. A November 2019 report from the National Council on Disability found:   [m]any healthcare providers critically undervalue life with a disability. Providers often perceive people with disabilities to have a low quality of life when, in reality, most report a high quality of life and level of happiness, especially when they have access to sufficient healthcare services and supports. This misperception has negatively influenced physicians\\u2019 medical futility decisions and resulted in the withdrawal of necessary medical care from people with disabilities.14   \\t\\t13 M. A. Rysavy, A. Das, S. R.  Hintz, J. B. Stoll, B. R. Vohr, et al., Between-hospital variation in treatment and outcomes in extremely preterm infants, 372 New Engl. J. Med. 1801 (2015). 14 National Counsel on Disability, Medical Futility and Disability Bias, Bioethics and Disability Series at 10 (Nov. 2019).  \\n \\t12 \\n Such biases play a large role in setting institutional policies concerning whether to default against care in dealing with premature newborns, where there is an incorrect presumption that most if not all survivors will have severe disabilities.15 In discussing treatment decisions with parents, doctors may use the word futile as code to mean that the survival of the baby is not worth the cost of the treatment.16 Though various studies have shown that, when adjusted for future life expectancy, costs for NICU treatments are one-twentieth to one-tenth the costs of treatments for adult ICU patients,17 some researchers and doctors are reluctant to allow that the quality of life obtained is worth the treatment costs. In doing so, a circular dynamic is established where anticipated poor prognoses lead to denial of medical care, which in turn leads to poor outcomes and low survival rates, reinforcing the data underlying the original poor prognosis.   The same circularity can manifest itself with regard to social conditions. In 2018, the University of Texas released a report of the disparity between infant mortality rates from zip code to zip code.18 \\t\\t15 P. Watkins, J. Dagle, et al., Outcomes at 18 to 22 Months of Corrected Age for Infants Born at 22 to 25 Weeks of Gestation in a Center Practicing Active Management, 217 J. Pediatrics 52 (Feb 2020). See also Patrick J. Marmion, Decreasing disabilities by letting babies die, 33 Issues in Law and Medicine 209 (Nov 2018). 16 Barrington, supra n. 11. 17 Marmion, supra, n. 12. 18 E. Nehme, et al., Infant mortality in communities across Texas, The University of Texas (2012). \\n \\t13 \\n Though Texas had an infant mortality rate lower than the national average, troubling findings were uncovered when some zip codes were shown to have disparities as high as 12 times the rates of neighboring zip codes.19 While all races had areas of high infant mortality, Black mothers had the highest rates of infant mortality overall.20 Even when a mother lives in a locale flooded with medical resources, a child\\u2019s chance of survival can decrease if none of the local hospitals have enough experience in saving the lives of extremely premature babies. While generally speaking, the availability of a NICU in a geographical area increases chances of survival, when NICUs become more commonplace, each unit may see fewer individual cases of periviable births each year and, thus, have less experience in successfully treating these babies.21 This can then perpetuate the myth that active treatment is \\u201cfutile,\\u201d which may indurate a physician\\u2019s incorrect assumption that a child of a certain age or weight is simply non-viable.   In sum, this Court\\u2019s assumption in Roe, Colautti, and Casey that there is a \\u201cpoint\\u201d in pregnancy when viability \\u201coccurs\\u201d is mistaken. Viability is a prediction, not a point. Even if there were such a point, it would be impossible for most doctors, especially abortion providers who rarely \\t\\t19 Id. at 7. 20 Id. at 12. 21  R.

Viability depends on myriad factors that vary and fluctuate both before and after birth, from the physical to the philosophical, from the personal to the institutional to the systemic.  III. ATTACHING CONSTITUTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE TO VIABILITY IS ILLOGICAL.   Why is any of this relevant to the case at issue? Mississippi\\u2019s Gestational Age Act bans almost all abortions after 15 weeks\\u2019 gestation. Petitioners have never suggested that an unborn child at 15 weeks\\u2019 gestation is capable of sustained survival outside the womb under any circumstances, so why does uncertainty about the \\u201cpoint\\u201d of viability matter? It matters because this Court has built a constitutional framework on an illogical and imaginary premise, undeserving of the benefit of stare decisis.  As noted above, this Court\\u2019s explanation in Roe of the significance of the non-existent \\u201cpoint\\u201d of viability consisted simply of restating the definition of viability. Colautti, in turn, took the significance of viability as a given, with no further attempt at explaining the logic behind it. Rather, Colautti emphasized that, because the point of viability (i.e., \\u201ca reasonable probability of the fetus\\u2019 sustained survival outside the womb\\u201d) is specific to each pregnancy and can be determined only by the attending physician, \\u201cneither the legislature nor \\n \\t15 \\n the courts may proclaim one of the elements entering  into the ascertainment of viability -- be it weeks of gestation or fetal weight or any other single factor -- as the determinant of when the State has a compelling interest in the life or health of the fetus.\\u201d Colautti, 439 U.S. at 388-389 (emphasis added). This Court has never revoked or modified Colautti\\u2019s holding that an abortion ban based on gestational age is impermissible, and that determination of viability must be left to the judgment of the \\u201cresponsible attending\\u201d abortion provider. As the years rolled by, dissenting justices continued to point out the illogic of attaching constitutional significance to viability, e.g.,    The governmental interest at issue is in protecting those who will be citizens if their lives are not ended in the womb. The substantiality of this interest is in no way dependent on the probability that the fetus may be capable of surviving outside the womb at any given point in its development, as the possibility of fetal survival is contingent on the state of medical practice and technology, factors that are in essence morally and constitutionally irrelevant. The State's interest is in the fetus as an entity in itself, and the character of this entity does not change at the point of viability under conventional medical wisdom. Accordingly, the State's interest, if compelling after viability, is equally compelling before viability. \\n \\t16 \\n  Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747, 795 (1986) (White, J., dissenting). See also, City of Akron v. Akron Ctr. for Reprod. Health, 462 U.S. 416, 461 (1983) (O\\u2019Connor, J., dissenting) (\\u201cThe choice of viability as the point at which the state interest in potential life becomes compelling is no less arbitrary than choosing any point before viability or any point afterward.\\u201d)   However, the plurality in Casey, relying on stare decisis, reaffirmed the Court\\u2019s commitment to the constitutional significance of viability, even while acknowledging that its original judgment might have been unsound:  [V]iability marks the earliest point at which the State's interest in fetal life is constitutionally adequate to justify a legislative ban on nontherapeutic abortions. The soundness or unsoundness of that constitutional judgment in no sense turns on whether viability occurs at approximately 28 weeks, as was usual at the time of Roe, at 23 to 24 weeks, as it sometimes does today, or at some moment even slightly earlier in pregnancy, as it may if fetal respiratory capacity can somehow be enhanced in the future.  Casey, 505 U.S. at 860 (emphasis added). In affirming \\u201cRoe\\u2019s central holding,\\u201d the Casey plurality also restated Roe\\u2019s utterly false premise \\n \\t17 \\n that viability \\u201coccurs\\u201d at a \\u201cpoint\\u201d or \\u201cmoment\\u201d in pregnancy. The Casey plurality made a self-conscious attempt to explain the reasoning behind the viability standard:  The second reason is that the concept of viability, as we noted in Roe, is the time at which there is a realistic possibility of maintaining and nourishing a life outside the womb, so that the independent existence of the second life can in reason and all fairness be the object of state protection that now overrides the rights of the woman.22   Casey, 505 U.S. at 870.  However, as Justice Scalia pointed out,  [t]he arbitrariness of the viability line is confirmed by the Court's inability to offer any justification for it beyond the conclusory \\t\\t22 This Court also half-heartedly offered a third justification for drawing a line a viability: \\u201cThe viability line also has, as a practical matter, an element of fairness. In some broad sense it might be said that a woman who fails to act before viability has consented to the State's intervention on behalf of the developing child.\\u201d Casey, 505 U.S. at 870. However, given government data showing that over 90% of abortions are performed in the first trimester and over 98% by 20 weeks of pregnancy (CDC, Abortion Surveillance \\u2013 Findings and Reports (2016), available at https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/data_stats/abortion.htm), laches could be said, as a matter of fairness, to come into play well before viability.  \\n \\t18 \\n assertion that it is only at that point that the unborn child's life \\\"can in reason and all fairness\\\" be thought to override the interests of the mother. . . .  Precisely why is it that, at the magical second when machines currently in use (though not necessarily available to the particular woman) are able to keep an unborn child alive apart from its mother, the creature is suddenly able (under our Constitution) to be protected by law, whereas before that magical second it was not? That makes no more sense than according infants legal protection only after the point when they can feed themselves.  Id. at 989, fn. 5 (Scalia, J., concurring and dissenting).23  With a touch of unconscious irony, the Casey plurality distinguished the freedom of legislatures to \\u201cdraw lines which appear arbitrary without the necessity of offering a justification\\u201d from its own duty to justify its line-drawing. Id. at 870. But no legal scholar has found this Court\\u2019s justification persuasive, much less compelling.24 This Court\\u2019s \\t\\t23 A closer analogy than Justice Scalia\\u2019s might be found in the concept of \\u201cpool safe,\\u201d defined as the stage of development at which a child has a reasonable chance of survival if he or she accidentally falls into a swimming pool. Analogizing to viability, the state may act to protect the life of a pool-safe child, but may not act to protect a child who is not pool safe from being held face down in a bucket of water until dead.  24 See, e.g., Paul Benjamin Linton and Maura K. Quinlan, Does Stare Decisis Preclude Reconsideration of Roe v. Wade? A Critique of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 70 Case W. Res. L. \\n \\t19 \\n fictitious \\u201cpoint of viability\\u201d line has less justification than Mississippi\\u2019s line of 15 weeks, based as the latter is on the science of fetal development, preservation of maternal health, and protection of medical ethics. Compare Pet. Cert. at 15-20 (examining viability standard) with id. at 20-26 (justification for 15-week abortion limit).   The Casey plurality also noted that \\u201cthere is no line other than viability which is more workable.\\u201d Casey, 505 U.S. at 370. But, as demonstrated above, viability is not a line, or a point, or a moment, and for that reason, it is less \\u201cworkable,\\u201d and certainly gives less notice, than a limit on abortion stated in weeks of gestational age justified by factors such as anatomical development, the capability of feeling pain, or the presence of a heartbeat. Viability as determined by the abortion provider is \\u201cworkable\\u201d only in the sense that it is unenforceable, and thus does not give rise to difficult cases. It \\u201cworks\\u201d for the abortion industry, but not for the state trying to protect unborn children.   CONCLUSION \\t Mississippi\\u2019s 15-week abortion restriction is well-supported by the state\\u2019s compelling interest in the preservation of human life.

CAC works in our courts, through our government, and with legal schol-ars to improve understanding of the Constitution and preserve the rights and freedoms it guarantees.  CAC has a strong interest in ensuring meaningful access to the courts, in accordance with constitutional text and history, and therefore has an interest in this case. INTRODUCTION AND  SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT According to Yassir Fazaga and the other plain-tiffs in this case, the FBI used an informant to gather information about them and make surreptitious re-cordings of their private conversations\\u2014all because of their religion.  In response to their lawsuit alleging vi-olations of the Constitution and the Foreign Intelli-gence Surveillance Act (FISA), the government tried to invoke the state secrets privilege to have the case dis-missed, but the court below held that the privilege was displaced here by FISA procedures allowing judges to review materials concerning electronic surveillance in camera to determine the lawfulness of the surveil-lance.  Disagreeing with that conclusion, the govern-ment attempts to buttress its statutory arguments by  1 The parties have consented to the filing of this brief.  Under Rule 37.6 of the Rules of this Court, amicus states that no counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part, and no counsel or party made a monetary contribution intended to fund the prep-aration or submission of this brief.  No person other than amicus or its counsel made a monetary contribution to its preparation or submission. \\n2 invoking constitutional principles that it says should control the Act\\u2019s interpretation.  This effort to tilt the interpretive scales in the government\\u2019s favor should be rejected.   According to the government, the state secrets privilege \\u201cis rooted in the Executive\\u2019s Art[icle] II duties to protect the national security and conduct foreign af-fairs.\\u201d  Pet. Br. 3.  Because of that \\u201cconstitutional foun-dation,\\u201d the government says, this Court should not in-terpret FISA here in the same way that statutes are normally construed\\u2014instead, it should adopt a pre-sumption against displacement of the state secrets privilege by requiring a \\u201cclear statement . . . that Con-gress intended to bring about such a startling change in the Executive\\u2019s authority to protect national-secu-rity information.\\u201d  Id. at 3, 47.  In other words, accord-ing to the government, \\u201cany ambiguity should be con-strued in favor of retaining the privilege.\\u201d  Id. at 19. The government\\u2019s position rests on a misleading account of the state secrets privilege that is at odds with the history of the privilege and this Court\\u2019s prec-edents.  In reality, the judiciary has never grounded the state secrets privilege in the Constitution; rather, it developed the privilege as a matter of federal com-mon law, using its power to devise evidentiary rules based on its own perceptions of sound public policy.  In-deed, far from representing a construction of the pres-ident\\u2019s inherent Article II authority over military and foreign affairs, the key aspects of the state secrets priv-ilege were drawn from twentieth-century case law in the United Kingdom, which this Court imported nearly wholesale into federal common law when it es-tablished the contours of the privilege in United States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1 (1953).  None of this Court\\u2019s decisions resolving state secrets questions has ever \\n3 relied on the separation of powers or inherent execu-tive authority under the Constitution. In addition to distorting the legal basis for the state secrets privilege, the government also exagger-ates its historical pedigree.  For most of the nineteenth century, there was no American case law recognizing any privilege from disclosing state secrets in judicial proceedings.  See Robert M. Chesney, State Secrets and the Limits of National Security Litigation, 75 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1249, 1273-77 (2007).  While the govern-ment claims that episodes in the early Republic indi-cate a recognition of the executive\\u2019s power to withhold sensitive information from disclosure, those inci-dents\\u2014each of which is deeply ambiguous\\u2014at best represent early expressions of a general concept of ex-ecutive privilege, rooted in concerns over confidential-ity in government communications.  These episodes have little if any bearing on the state secrets privilege and provide no evidence of a constitutional foundation for that doctrine. Rather than stemming from principles widely ac-cepted in the early Republic, the concept of an eviden-tiary privilege protecting state secrets from disclosure in court proceedings was a later innovation that devel-oped slowly in American jurisprudence.  And far from reflecting constitutional imperatives, the privilege was justified, at every step of its development, exclusively by the courts\\u2019 common law authority to shape eviden-tiary rules in service of public policy. The idea of a state secrets privilege entered Amer-ican legal thought through the works of nineteenth-century treatise writers, who drew on diverse strands of English precedent in an effort to \\u201crationalize and systematize the body of common law evidentiary rules.\\u201d  Id. at 1270.  When this Court first endorsed a bar against the judicial enforcement of espionage \\n4 agreements in Totten v. United States, 92 U.S. 105 (1875), it similarly relied on analogies to common law privileges shielding \\u201cconfidential\\u201d information from disclosure, as well as on general notions of \\u201cpublic pol-icy,\\u201d id. at 107, without referencing constitutional con-siderations of any kind.  See Gen. Dynamics Corp. v. United States, 563 U.S. 478, 485 (2011) (describing Totten as a use of \\u201cour common-law authority to fash-ion contractual remedies\\u201d). Notwithstanding Totten, which involved a \\u201cunique and categorical\\u201d rule barring certain types of suits en-tirely, Tenet v. Doe, 544 U.S. 1, 6 n.4 (2005), it was not until the early twentieth century that \\u201c[t]he core of a distinctive \\u2018state secrets\\u2019 privilege, focused on security-related matters, . . . beg[a]n to emerge,\\u201d Chesney, su-pra, at 1281.  Over the first half of that century, a num-ber of lower court decisions recognized an evidentiary privilege against the public disclosure of government materials on the ground that their release would harm the public interest.  Throughout this period, the emerging state secrets privilege continued to be under-stood as a common law evidentiary doctrine, not a mat-ter of constitutional law, supported by citations to treatises, pragmatic arguments from necessity, and vague invocations of \\u201cpublic policy.\\u201d  Firth Sterling Steel Co. v. Bethlehem Steel Co., 199 F. 353, 355 (E.D. Pa. 1912). Before Reynolds, state secrets jurisprudence re-mained \\u201climited and vague, and failed to set forth a standardized doctrine by which privilege claims ought to be evaluated.\\u201d  Sudha Setty, Litigating Secrets: Comparative Perspectives on the State Secrets Privi-lege, 75 Brook. L. Rev. 201, 232 (2009).  When this Court eventually fleshed out the contours of the state secrets privilege and outlined a process to use in ad-ministering it, this Court acknowledged that judicial \\n5 experience with the privilege had been \\u201climited in this country.\\u201d  Reynolds, 345 U.S. at 7.  To fill the gap, this Court turned to contemporary developments in the United Kingdom, largely adopting the substantive and procedural standards for the privilege that had been recently prescribed by the House of Lords in Duncan v. Cammell, Laird & Co., [1942] A.C. 624 (H.L.).   Critically, Reynolds derived none of its new stand-ards from the separation of powers or the president\\u2019s Article II authority.  Indeed, this Court expressly dis-claimed any reliance on constitutional principles when fashioning these standards\\u2014despite the government\\u2019s urging of an \\u201cinherent executive power\\u201d under the Constitution to withhold materials from the judiciary.  See 345 U.S. at 6 & n.9.  Instead, Reynolds \\u201cdecided a purely evidentiary dispute by applying evidentiary rules.\\u201d  Gen. Dynamics, 563 U.S. at 485.  As in prior decisions concerning the state secrets privilege, this Court exercised its authority under federal common law to recognize evidentiary privileges based on gen-eral assessments of good public policy.   Reynolds remains \\u201cthe only instance in which [this] Court has articulated a standard for the state secrets privilege.\\u201d  Setty, supra, at 208; cf. Tenet, 544 U.S. at 8-9 (applying the Totten bar while distinguish-ing it from the Reynolds privilege); Gen. Dynamics, 563 U.S. at 485-87 (same).  To be sure, passages in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974), a case that did not concern state secrets, may suggest that Arti-cle II calls for some type of evidentiary privilege ena-bling the president to safeguard military and diplo-matic secrets from public disclosure.  \\u201cPlainly, how-ever,\\u201d whatever \\u201ccore\\u201d of the state secrets privilege might be constitutionally compelled \\u201cdoes not account for the full scope of the privilege as it has come to be understood.\\u201d  Chesney, supra, at 1309.  None of the \\n6 specific components of the privilege articulated in Reynolds has ever been linked to constitutional imper-atives\\u2014including the rules concerning in camera re-view of allegedly privileged material.   In light of this history, the government is wildly off base to portray the state secrets privilege as \\u201cfirmly rooted in the Constitution,\\u201d with its common law ori-gins relegated to an afterthought.  Pet. Br. 42.  Far from being the product of constitutional analysis, the standards governing the state secrets privilege were patterned on foreign sources in the course of exercising the courts\\u2019 authority to craft evidentiary rules under federal common law, without any consideration of Ar-ticle II or the separation of powers.   There is no warrant, therefore, for placing an in-terpretive thumb on the scale in the government\\u2019s fa-vor here by imposing an unusual requirement that Congress be \\u201cunmistakably clear\\u201d in displacing the state secrets privilege.  Pet. Br. 16 (quoting Pet. App. 110a (Bumatay, J., dissenting from the denial of re-hearing en banc)).  Instead, this case should be re-solved just like any other statutory dispute in which a party argues that Congress has supplanted federal common law.  Under that standard, for the reasons ex-plained by Respondents, the decision below should be affirmed. ARGUMENT I. The State Secrets Privilege Is Not a Product of Constitutional Analysis but of Federal Common Law. In the government\\u2019s telling, the state secrets priv-ilege is \\u201cinherent in the constitutional design\\u201d and has been \\u201cacknowledged since our Nation\\u2019s founding.\\u201d  Pet. Br. 46 (quoting Pet. App. 134a (Bumatay, J., dissent-ing from denial of rehearing en banc)).  In reality, the \\n7 standards governing the privilege \\u201cemerged during the mid-twentieth century,\\u201d Chesney, supra, at 1271, and were fashioned as a matter of federal common law without reference to the Constitution.  Constitutional reasoning concerning executive authority and the sep-aration of powers has played no role at any point in the long development of the state secrets privilege. A. Nineteenth-century precursors to the state secrets privilege invoked English common law and general notions of public policy. Although the government cites episodes from the early Republic to claim that the state secrets privilege has been \\u201cacknowledged since our Nation\\u2019s founding,\\u201d Pet. Br. 46 (quoting Pet. App. 134a), those episodes have no clear relationship to the privilege.  See infra Part II.  Until the late nineteenth century, there was no American case law recognizing any \\u201cprivilege against court-ordered disclosure of state and military secrets.\\u201d  Gen. Dynamics, 563 U.S. at 484. Instead, the concept of such a privilege entered American legal thought in the mid\\u2013nineteenth cen-tury, thanks to \\u201ctreatise writers actively seeking to ra-tionalize and systematize the body of common law ev-identiary rules.\\u201d  Chesney, supra, at 1270.  Given \\u201cthe absence of on-point case law in the United States,\\u201d these authors \\u201crelied extensively on English prece-dent.\\u201d  Id. at 1273.  They did not root their discussions in the American separation of powers or the presi-dent\\u2019s constitutional authority.  Rather, citing English decisions and general notions of public policy, these authors combined \\u201cdisparate threads\\u201d under \\u201cthe um-brella concept of a multifaceted \\u2018public interest\\u2019 privi-lege, some aspects of which were referred to under the subheading of \\u2018state secrets.\\u2019\\u201d  Id. at 1270-71. \\n8 For example, Thomas Starkie\\u2019s English treatise on evidence\\u2014subsequently published and widely influen-tial in America\\u2014discussed the exclusion of evidence \\u201con grounds of public policy,\\u201d including in situations where \\u201cdisclosure might be prejudicial to the commu-nity.\\u201d  1 Thomas Starkie, A Practical Treatise on the Law of Evidence 69, 71 (7th Am. ed. 1842).  This dis-cussion integrated \\u201cthree distinct lines of English prec-edent\\u201d involving protections for criminal informers, for the deliberative process, and for information kept se-cret \\u201con security grounds.\\u201d  Chesney, supra, at 1274; see, e.g., Starkie, supra, at 71-72 (citing Rex v. Watson, 2 Starkie\\u2019s C. 148 (K.B. 1817), where, for public safety, \\u201can officer from the Tower of London could not be ex-amined as to the accuracy of a plan of the Tower\\u201d). Simon Greenleaf\\u2019s treatise, \\u201carguably the first suc-cessful volume of this nature to be written from an ex-plicitly American perspective,\\u201d Chesney, supra, at 1276, likewise discussed evidence \\u201cexcluded from mo-tives of public policy,\\u201d including \\u201csecrets of State . . . the disclosure of which would be prejudicial to the public interest,\\u201d 1 Simon Greenleaf, A Treatise on the Law of Evidence 327 (7th ed. 1854).  Greenleaf\\u2019s \\u201csecrets of state\\u201d category encompassed a diverse range of situa-tions not tied to military or foreign affairs, was based primarily on English precedent, and referenced no American constitutional law principles.  See id. at 329.   While treatises propagated the idea of evidentiary privileges tied to public safety, it was not until 1875, in Totten, that this Court first established \\u201ca Govern-ment privilege against court-ordered disclosure of state and military secrets.\\u201d  Gen. Dynamics, 563 U.S. at 484.  Totten \\u201cpreclude[d] judicial review\\u201d entirely in cases \\u201cwhere success depends upon the existence of [a] secret espionage relationship with the Government,\\u201d Tenet, 544 U.S. at 8, essentially concluding that \\u201csome \\n9 claims against the government are simply not justici-able based on the nature of the claim being made and the need for government secrecy,\\u201d Setty, supra, at 233.  While Totten\\u2019s \\u201cunique and categorical\\u201d bar to suit is distinct from the more limited evidentiary privilege recognized in later cases, Tenet, 544 U.S. at 6 n.4, it was \\u201ca significant extension of the still-evolving con-cept of a state secrets privilege,\\u201d Chesney, supra, at 1278; see Gen. Dynamics, 563 U.S. at 485-86 (describ-ing Totten as part of \\u201cour state-secrets jurisprudence\\u201d). Totten \\u201cat no point described its holding in separa-tion of powers or other constitutional terms.\\u201d  Chesney, supra, at 1278.  \\u201cRather, the Court simply spoke in terms of the detrimental \\u2018public policy\\u2019 ramifications of permitting lawsuits regarding unacknowledged espio-nage contracts to proceed,\\u201d id. at 1278-79, reasoning that secrecy was an implied term of such contracts, precluding \\u201cany action for their enforcement,\\u201d Totten, 92 U.S. at 107; cf. Gen. Dynamics, 563 U.S. at 490 (\\u201cAs in Totten, our refusal to enforce this contract captures what the ex ante expectations of the parties were or reasonably ought to have been.\\u201d (citation omitted)).   Given the secret matters involved, Totten com-pared the enforcement of espionage contracts to other types of suits that could not be pursued because they would \\u201clead to the disclosure of matters which the law itself regards as confidential.\\u201d  Totten, 92 U.S. at 107 (citing suits that \\u201cwould require a disclosure of the con-fidences of the confessional, or those between husband and wife, or of communications by a client to his coun-sel for professional advice, or of a patient to his physi-cian\\u201d).  As with those other examples of common law evidentiary privileges, suits to enforce espionage agreements were prohibited for the simple reason that exposing the relevant facts would be to the \\u201cserious detriment of the public.\\u201d  Id.  \\u201c\\u2018[P]ublic policy,\\u2019\\u201d this \\n10 Court held, \\u201cforbids the maintenance of any [such] suit.\\u201d  Gen. Dynamics, 563 U.S. at 486 (quoting Totten, 92 U.S. at 107).  Totten thus \\u201cfollowed the British ex-ample . . . in recognizing a public-policy justification in American law for precluding public disclosure of infor-mation on security-related grounds.\\u201d  Chesney, supra, at 1278.   In short, Totten was an exercise of the judiciary\\u2019s \\u201ccommon-law authority to fashion contractual reme-dies in Government-contracting disputes.\\u201d  Gen. Dy-namics, 563 U.S. at 485; see id. at 488 (explaining that courts may refuse, \\u201con grounds of public policy,\\u201d to aid an \\u201cunenforceable promise\\u201d).  Totten\\u2019s \\u201cpublic policy\\u201d rationale arose from that common law framework, not from any reference to Article II or the separation of powers.  And that rationale persists today.  See id. at 487 (\\u201crefusal to enforce promises contrary to public policy . . . is not unknown to the common law, and the traditional course is to leave the parties where they stood\\u201d); id. at 491 (\\u201cwhat we promulgate today is . . . a common-law opinion\\u201d). B. When a privilege concerning state secrets began to emerge in the twentieth century, it was based on federal common law authority to shape evidentiary rules in service of public policy. \\u201cBy the late nineteenth century, treatise writers in the United States had begun to refer expressly to a \\u2018state secrets\\u2019 privilege.\\u201d  Chesney, supra, at 1280.  But they were still using that term \\u201cmuch as the early writ-ers had referred to a \\u2018public interest\\u2019 privilege: namely, as an umbrella concept integrating cases like Totten . . . with precedents concerning the informer\\u2019s privi-lege, the deliberative-process privilege, and the gov-ernment-communications privilege.\\u201d  Id.  Only \\u201cin the \\n11 early twentieth century\\u201d did the \\u201c[t]he core of a distinc-tive \\u2018state secrets\\u2019 privilege, focused on security-re-lated matters, . . . begin to emerge.\\u201d  Id. at 1281.  The nature of the privilege remained nebulous throughout this period, with little articulation of its standards or procedures.  But the nascent doctrine was firmly un-derstood as a common law evidentiary principle\\u2014not a matter of constitutional law\\u2014justified by citations to treatises, pragmatic arguments from necessity, and vague invocations of public policy. Over the first half of the twentieth century, in \\u201cfairly conclusory fashion and without extended anal-ysis, a handful of lower courts considered what was in substance a state secrets privilege, typically described as a \\u2018military or national security privilege.\\u2019\\u201d  Anthony John Trenga, What Judges Say and Do in Deciding National Security Cases: The Example of the State Se-crets Privilege, 9 Harv. Nat\\u2019l Sec. J. 1, 12 (2018).  In the absence of any comprehensive standards or \\u201cunify-ing doctrine,\\u201d Setty, supra, at 234, these decisions rested on vague invocations of \\u201cpublic policy,\\u201d sup-ported by citations to treatises, English precedent, and Totten.  See Firth Sterling, 199 F. at 355 (citing those sources for \\u201cthe rule of public policy forbidding the dis-closure of military secrets\\u201d); Robinson v. United States, 50 Ct. Cl. 159, 167 (1915) (\\u201cThe Government is not re-quired to answer questions or supply papers which on the grounds of public policy it is entitled to resist.\\u201d); Pollen v. United States, 85 Ct. Cl. 673, 679 (1937) (re-lying on treatises and the \\u201cmany English cases\\u201d pro-tecting \\u201cmilitary secrets, the disclosure of which . . . would be detrimental to the National defense\\u201d).   Courts universally understood the emerging state secrets privilege to be a common law evidentiary doc-trine.  See O\\u2019Neill v. United States, 79 F. Supp. 827, 829 (E.D. Pa. 1948) (citing \\u201cthe general policy of the \\n12 common law, prohibiting disclosure of state secrets the publication of which might . . . harm the government in its diplomatic relations, military operations or measures for national security\\u201d); Firth Sterling, 199 F. at 355 (stating that \\u201cat common law\\u201d the court \\u201cmight, upon grounds of public policy, strike out evidence of this nature\\u201d).  Constitutional principles were not in-voked.   Indeed, when decisions of this era elaborated on the theoretical justification for the privilege, they de-scribed it as a matter of practical necessity emanating from a right of self-preservation intrinsic to all govern-ments.  See, e.g., Pollen, 85 Ct. Cl. at 681 (the privilege is \\u201cpredicated upon the principle of the public good and the right of the Sovereign to maintain an efficient Na-tional defense,\\u201d which \\u201ctranscends the individual in-terests of a private citizen\\u201d).  The reasoning was prag-matic, not constitutional, and no emphasis was placed on executive branch authority vis-\\u00e0-vis the other branches.  See, e.g., Pollen v. Ford Instrument Co., 26 F. Supp. 583, 584 (E.D.N.Y. 1939) (citing \\u201cthe inherent right of self-preservation for purposes of national de-fense\\u201d as \\u201ca paramount government right\\u201d).   Because courts were fashioning a common law doc-trine rather than discerning the executive branch\\u2019s constitutional authority, they felt free to look to con-temporary developments in foreign law for inspiration.  In Bank Line v. United States, 163 F.2d 133 (2d Cir. 1947), for instance, the court of appeals recommended that the district court \\u201cconsider the views of the Eng-lish House of Lords recently expressed . . . in Duncan v. Cammell, Laird & Co., (1942) A.C. 624, when dis-cussing the nature of the privilege to withhold produc-tion of official documents on grounds of public inter-est.\\u201d  Bank Line, 163 F.2d at 139. \\n13 Moreover, even when the government raised con-stitutional arguments in support of nondisclosure, it did not base these arguments on the president\\u2019s mili-tary or foreign affairs powers under Article II.  Rather, the government simply claimed a broad executive priv-ilege to withhold information of any kind from the other branches.  See O\\u2019Neill, 79 F. Supp. at 830 (de-scribing the attorney general\\u2019s argument that under the separation of powers he was \\u201cfree to refuse disclo-sure of any evidence in his possession, regardless of its character, for any reason which may seem to him suffi-cient\\u201d (emphasis added)); United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462, 469 (1951) (describing the at-torney general\\u2019s assertion of \\u201ca determinative power as to whether or on what conditions . . . he may refuse to produce government papers under his charge\\u201d); 25 Op. Att\\u2019y Gen. 326, 331 (1905) (advising a department head that he could decline to furnish records of his de-partment \\u201cwhenever in your judgment the production of such papers . . . might prove prejudicial for any rea-son to the Government or to the public interest\\u201d). Significantly, too, courts that recognized a state secrets privilege in this era saw no tension between that privilege and a judge\\u2019s in camera review of the materials alleged to be privileged.  See Cresmer v. United States, 9 F.R.D. 203, 204 (E.D.N.Y. 1949) (\\u201c[T]o make sure that the report in question contained no military or service secrets which would be detrimental to the interests of the armed forces of the United States or to the National security, I requested counsel to produce the report for my examination.\\u201d). \\n14 C. The standards governing the state secrets privilege were borrowed, as a matter of federal common law, from contemporary developments in the United Kingdom. In United States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1 (1953), this Court confirmed the existence of a state secrets privilege in the common law of evidence and for the first time established standards to govern the admin-istration of the privilege.  Those standards were im-ported nearly wholesale from contemporary case law in the United Kingdom.  This Court borrowed those standards as an exercise of federal common law au-thority without suggesting that any of them have any relationship to the separation of powers or the presi-dent\\u2019s Article II authority. Reynolds was a dispute \\u201cabout the admission of ev-idence,\\u201d Gen. Dynamics, 563 U.S. at 485, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Those rules author-ized discovery only of materials \\u201cnot privileged,\\u201d which this Court construed as referring \\u201cto \\u2018privileges\\u2019 as that term is understood in the law of evidence.\\u201d  Reynolds, 345 U.S. at 6.  \\u201cAt the time, Congress had not yet ap-proved the Federal Rules of Evidence, and therefore the only \\u2018law of evidence\\u2019 to apply in federal court was an amalgam of common law, local practice and statu-tory provisions with indefinite contours.\\u201d  In re NSA Telecommunications Recs. Litig., 564 F. Supp. 2d 1109, 1123 (N.D. Cal. 2008).  Citing treatises and some of the limited American precedent available, this Court con-firmed that a privilege against revealing military and state secrets was \\u201cwell established in the law of evi-dence.\\u201d  Reynolds, 345 U.S. at 6-7. Beyond merely recognizing the existence of such a privilege, Reynolds fleshed out its contours and \\u201cadopted for the first time a methodology\\u201d for \\n15 administering it.  Trenga, supra, at 13.  That guidance was sorely needed because, as this Court observed, \\u201c[j]udicial experience with the privilege\\u201d had \\u201cbeen limited in this country.\\u201d  Reynolds, 345 U.S. at 7. In confirming the existence of a state secrets priv-ilege and defining its scope, this Court did not draw on Article II, the separation of powers, or any other con-stitutional principles concerning executive authority.  Reynolds was explicit on this point: The government asserted a \\u201cpower to suppress documents\\u201d based on \\u201can inherent executive power which is protected in the constitutional system of separation of power.\\u201d  Id. at 6 n.9.  But this Court disclaimed any reliance on consti-tutional considerations, finding it \\u201cunnecessary to pass upon\\u201d these \\u201cbroad propositions.\\u201d  Id. at 6.  In-stead, Reynolds \\u201cdecided a purely evidentiary dispute by applying evidentiary rules.\\u201d  Gen. Dynamics, 563 U.S. at 485.2 Having expressly \\u201cdeclined to address the consti-tutional question\\u201d raised by the government, Reynolds simply \\u201cinterpreted and applied federal common law.\\u201d  In re NSA, 564 F. Supp. 2d at 1123.  But with \\u201clittle domestic doctrine to rely upon,\\u201d Setty, supra, at 226-27, this Court sketched the outlines of the state secrets privilege by turning to foreign law\\u2014specifically, con-temporary standards in the United Kingdom.  \\u201cEng-lish experience has been more extensive,\\u201d this Court explained, and \\u201cthe principles which control the appli-cation of the privilege emerge quite clearly from the available precedents.\\u201d  Reynolds, 345 U.S. at 7; see Wil-liam G. Weaver & Robert M. Pallitto, State Secrets and  2 Reynolds did draw on constitutional principles, but not con-cerning Article II or the separation of powers.  See 345 U.S. at 8 (analogizing to the privilege against self-incrimination secured by the Fifth Amendment). \\n16 Executive Power, 120 Pol. Sci. Q. 85, 97 (2005) (while American decisions had begun to distinguish the state secrets privilege from various forms of executive priv-ilege, \\u201ccase law in the United States proved too thin a resource to fully explain this distinction, and so [this] Court turned to the law of the United Kingdom and the development of the doctrine of \\u2018crown privilege\\u2019\\u201d).   Significantly, among the principles that Reynolds borrowed from abroad was a cautious stance toward in camera judicial review of materials alleged to be privileged\\u2014an attitude not previously found in Amer-ican state secrets jurisprudence.  Two English deci-sions, \\u201cone in the 1860s and the other in the 1940s,\\u201d were \\u201cdecisive\\u201d in entrenching this principle in Eng-land, \\u201claying the groundwork for the parameters of the U.S. state secrets privilege as laid out in Reynolds.\\u201d  Setty, supra, at 228.   First, Beatson v. Skene held that when the head of a department \\u201cstates that in his opinion the production of the document would be injurious to the public ser-vice, . . . the Judge ought not to compel the production of it.\\u201d  157 Eng. Rep. 1415, 1421-22 (Exch. Div. 1860).  Notably, \\u201c[t]he court in Beatson reasoned that a con-trary approach ordinarily would not be possible be-cause, it believed, a judicial inspection \\u2018cannot take place in private\\u2019 and thus necessarily would entail public exposure of the matter in issue.\\u201d  Chesney, su-pra, at 1280 (quoting Beatson, 157 Eng. Rep. at 1421). That principle was fortified in Duncan v. Cammell, Laird & Co., [1942] A.C. 624 (H.L.), in which the House of Lords essentially ruled that \\u201cif a government officer offers a good faith affidavit as to the need for nondisclosure,\\u201d it should be accepted \\u201cat face value.\\u201d  Setty, supra, at 228-29.  \\u201cThose who are responsible for the national security must be the sole judges of what the national security requires,\\u201d Duncan stated, \\n17 and so the \\u201capproved practice\\u201d was \\u201cto treat a Ministe-rial objection taken in proper form as conclusive,\\u201d and \\u201cthe Court should not ask to see the documents.\\u201d  Dun-can, A.C. 624 (quotation marks omitted).  While the decision to exclude documents remained \\u201cthe decision of the Judge,\\u201d a validly taken objection to production, \\u201con the ground that this would be injurious to the pub-lic interest,\\u201d was \\u201cconclusive.\\u201d  Id.   This Court largely \\u201cadopted the framework\\u201d of Duncan when setting forth the parameters of the state secrets privilege in Reynolds.  Weaver & Pallitto, su-pra, at 98; see Reynolds, 345 U.S. at 7-8 & nn.15, 20-22.  This Court made an important change, however, re-garding the one aspect of the privilege that it said \\u201cpre-sents real difficulty,\\u201d namely, the rule that a court de-termining whether the privilege applies should \\u201cdo so without forcing a disclosure of the very thing the priv-ilege is designed to protect.\\u201d  Reynolds, 345 U.S. at 8; see id. at 8 n.22 (citing Duncan for this principle).  Un-der Reynolds, an official\\u2019s assertion of the state secrets privilege is not \\u201cconclusive.\\u201d  Duncan, A.C. 624.  In-stead, drawing on judicial experience with the privi-lege against self-incrimination, this Court fashioned a \\u201clike formula of compromise,\\u201d permitting courts to re-quire a \\u201cdisclosure to the judge before the claim of priv-ilege will be accepted,\\u201d including, if necessary, a \\u201ccom-plete disclosure.\\u201d  Reynolds, 345 U.S. at 9-10. In sum, like Totten before it, Reynolds was a com-mon law decision decided on common law principles, and it derived none of its rules from the president\\u2019s Ar-ticle II responsibilities.  Exercising the traditional au-thority to carve out evidentiary privileges under fed-eral common law based on general assessments of sound public policy, this Court patterned the scope of the privilege on the model provided by contemporary law in the United Kingdom. \\n18 II. The Government Mischaracterizes the Origins and Foundation of the Privilege. A. Ambiguous episodes in the early Republic have no clear connection to the state secrets privilege. Despite the history recounted above, the govern-ment insists that \\u201c[t]he Executive\\u2019s power and duty . . . to protect state secrets\\u201d has been \\u201crecognized since the earliest years of the Republic,\\u201d Pet. Br. 2, and attempts to trace a direct line between certain episodes in the early Republic and the privilege later established in Reynolds.  That effort is unavailing.  Early judicial de-cisions did not recognize a state secrets privilege or any predecessor to it.  The government\\u2019s evidence con-sists of ambiguous dicta and an incident involving a congressional request for documents\\u2014none of which has any clear relationship to the state secrets privi-lege, much less supplies evidence of a constitutional foundation for that privilege. The \\u201cearly pronouncements\\u201d cited by the govern-ment and the dissent below \\u201cdealt with a series of evi-dentiary questions that were quite distinct from one another and which did not necessarily concern matters of a diplomatic or military nature.\\u201d  Chesney, supra, at 1270.  Focused on the confidentiality of communica-tions among government officials, not on presidential authority under Article II, these discussions are, at best, nascent expressions of a \\u201cgeneral notion of exec-utive privilege\\u201d that fail to clarify its \\u201cnature or ex-tent.\\u201d  Setty, supra, at 232; see Weaver & Pallitto, su-pra, at 96 (\\u201cuntil recently, courts did not undertake to disentangle executive privilege from the power to withhold military and state secrets from judicial pro-ceedings\\u201d). \\n19 The government points primarily to statements made by Chief Justice Marshall while presiding over Aaron Burr\\u2019s treason trial, in which the defense sought a letter discussing Burr that a U.S. general had sent to President Jefferson.  See United States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 187, 190 (C.C.D. Va. 1807).  According to the government, Marshall acknowledged a need for judi-cial deference to \\u201cthe President\\u2019s judgment that, in re-sponse to a trial subpoena, the public interest required that certain documents \\u2018be kept secret.\\u2019\\u201d  Pet. Br. 3 (quoting Burr, 25 F. Cas. at 192).  But the government mischaracterizes Marshall\\u2019s statements.   Contrary to the government\\u2019s intimation, Jeffer-son \\u201cdid not attempt to withhold any documents from production to the court.\\u201d  Setty, supra, at 232-33.  Ra-ther, prosecutor George Hay \\u201csaid he had that letter, and would produce it,\\u201d but that \\u201csome matters\\u201d dis-cussed in the letter \\u201cought not to be made public.\\u201d  Burr, 25 F. Cas. at 190 (emphasis added); see id. (ob-jecting to \\u201cpublic inspection\\u201d of these passages).  Nota-bly, Hay \\u201cwas willing to put them in the hands of the clerk confidentially\\u201d to \\u201ccopy all those parts which had relation to the cause,\\u201d and suggested that \\u201cif there should be any difference of opinion as to what were confidential passages, the court should decide.\\u201d  Id. (emphasis added).   Marshall approved a subpoena duces tecum for the letter, and Hay produced it, \\u201cexcepting such parts\\u201d as were, in his view, \\u201cnot material\\u201d to the defense or the issues involved.  Id.  The government \\u201cwas not resist-ing production on the ground that disclosure of the doc-ument would endanger the public safety,\\u201d Chesney, su-pra, at 1272 (quotation marks omitted), but rather be-cause portions of the letter were \\u201cconfidential,\\u201d Burr, 25 F. Cas. at 190.  And crucially, Hay had no objection to allowing the court to view the entire letter to \\n20 confirm that the passages in question were not mate-rial: \\u201cThe accuracy of this opinion I am willing to refer to the judgment of the court, by submitting the original letter to its inspection.\\u201d  Id. (emphasis added).  Thus, \\u201cthe Government was perfectly willing to leave it to the court to determine whether portions of the letter were in fact privileged.  It insisted only that the portions so adjudged should be withheld from the defendant.\\u201d  Ra-oul Berger & Abe Krash, Government Immunity from Discovery, 59 Yale L.J. 1451, 1458 (1950).   This was the context for Marshall\\u2019s statement re-lied on here by the government: \\u201cHad the president, when he transmitted [the letter], subjected it to cer-tain restrictions, and stated that in his judgment the public interest required certain parts of it to be kept secret, and had accordingly made a reservation of them, all proper respect would have been paid to it,\\u201d Marshall observed, \\u201cbut he has made no such reserva-tion.\\u201d  Burr, 25 F. Cas. at 192.  Marshall did not elab-orate on what \\u201cproper respect\\u201d would have entailed, and his focus, like the prosecutor\\u2019s, was on public dis-closure: In regard to the secrecy of these parts which it is stated are improper to give out to the world, the court will take any order that may be nec-essary.  I do not think that the accused ought to be prohibited from seeing the letter; but, if it should be thought proper, I will order that no copy of it be taken for public exhibition . . . .  After the accused has seen it, it will yet be a question whether it shall go to the jury or not. Id. (emphasis added).  The government \\u201cproduce[d] the letter under the restrictions suggested by the court,\\u201d id. at 192-93, and ultimately the evidentiary dispute \\u201cbecame moot, sparing Marshall the need to take a \\n21 firm stand with respect to privilege issues,\\u201d Chesney, supra, at 1272-73. In short, Burr does not evince any understanding in the early Republic that executive branch officials could withhold materials from review by the courts on national security grounds, much less suggest a consti-tutional pedigree for the modern state secrets privi-lege.  The government\\u2019s objections in Burr did not clearly relate to military or diplomatic secrets, and constitutional principles were not invoked.  Most im-portantly, no one raised any objection to judicial re-view of the allegedly immaterial passages in the dis-puted letter\\u2014not the prosecutor, not Jefferson, and not Marshall.  To the extent that Burr sheds any light on the present controversy, therefore, it supports the position of Respondents, not the government: the as-sumption shared by all was that court review would remain available even if particular information could not be disclosed publicly.    The dissent below cites Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137 (1803), to similar ends, pointing to a trial colloquy in that case as evidence that \\u201cthe Judiciary has long recognized an executive privilege over sensi-tive information.\\u201d  Pet. App. 116a (Bumatay, J., dis-senting from the denial of rehearing en banc).  But that exchange has nothing to do with state secrets.   At trial in Marbury, the attorney general claimed \\u201cthat he was not bound . . . to answer, as to any facts which came officially to his knowledge while acting as secretary of state.\\u201d  5 U.S. at 143; id. at 144 (\\u201cHe did not think himself bound to disclose his official transac-tions while acting as secretary of state.\\u201d).  Although Chief Justice Marshall had \\u201cno doubt he ought to an-swer\\u201d the questions put to him, because \\u201c[t]here was nothing confidential required to be disclosed,\\u201d Mar-shall also suggested that \\u201cif he thought that any thing \\n22 was communicated to him in confidence he was not bound to disclose it.\\u201d  Id. at 144. \\u201cThe Marbury dicta raised more questions than it answered.\\u201d  Chesney, supra, at 1272.  \\u201cDid the Court mean to suggest that confidential communications to executive branch officials are privileged,\\u201d and if so, \\u201cwas the basis for protection rooted in the common law of evidence, in constitutional considerations associated with the independence of the executive branch, or both?\\u201d  Id.  \\u201cOr was the point to suggest that courts lack the capacity to subject a cabinet official to judicial process . . . ?\\u201d  Id.   There is no way of knowing.  And regardless, the exchange did not involve any claim of authority to withhold state secrets from the judiciary on the basis of the president\\u2019s Article II authority over military and foreign affairs.  Instead, this episode and the one in Burr are \\u201cbest thought of\\u201d as pertaining to the \\u201cdelib-erative process privilege,\\u201d id. at 1274, or simply to an early conception of executive privilege more generally, see Trenga, supra, at 11 n.21.  Neither case is clearly related to the modern state secrets privilege, much less suggests that the privilege is grounded in the Con-stitution.3 With no other judicial sources of even arguable rel-evance, the government cites President Washington\\u2019s response to a legislative request for documents con-cerning the disastrous St. Clair expedition.  Pet. Br. 2; see Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP, 140 S. Ct. 2019, 2029- 3 Notably, Greenleaf\\u2019s mid-nineteenth-century treatise cited Burr and Marbury only in regard to protecting the confidentiality of communications among government officials, a privilege en-joyed by state as well as federal officers.  See Greenleaf, supra, at 329.  The American editor of Starkie\\u2019s treatise cited those opin-ions (only) for the same point.  See Starkie, supra, at 71 n.1. \\n23 30 (2020).  But this episode has even less to do with the state secrets privilege than the discussions in Mar-bury and Burr.   Upon receiving this congressional request, Wash-ington\\u2019s cabinet concluded\\u2014relying primarily on prec-edents from the English House of Commons\\u2014that presidents could withhold documents from Congress \\u201cthe disclosure of which would injure the public.\\u201d  1 The Writings of Thomas Jefferson 304 (Andrew Lip-scomb ed., 1903).  But despite affirming, in theory, this right to withhold documents from Congress, the cabi-net \\u201cagreed in this case, that there was not a paper which might not be properly produced.\\u201d  Id. at 305; see 20 Op. O.L.C. 253, 270 (1996) (\\u201c[T]he cabinet further advised President Washington that the documents in question could all be disclosed consistently with the public interest.\\u201d).   This episode did not concern privileges from dis-closure in judicial proceedings, much less the question of when judges can or should compel disclosure of con-tested materials in camera.  Moreover, there is no rec-ord of the basis for the position taken by Washington\\u2019s cabinet, beyond the vague public-interest rationale quoted above.  And although Congress, upon learning of the administration\\u2019s position, issued a new request asking only for papers \\u201cof a public nature,\\u201d 20 Op. O.L.C. at 270, the import of that change was also \\u201cam-biguous,\\u201d id. at 270 n.54 (quoting Abraham D. Sofaer, War, Foreign Affairs and Constitutional Power 82-83 (1976)).   In short, the St. Clair incident\\u2014flush with ambi-guity and fundamentally involving the interplay be-tween the political branches, see Mazars, 140 S. Ct. at 2031\\u2014offers paltry support for the notion that the state secrets privilege is \\u201ca longstanding feature of our \\n24 legal system\\u201d with \\u201ca firm foundation in the Constitu-tion.\\u201d  Pet. Br. 42, 45 (quotation marks omitted). B. Any relationship between Article II and the state secrets privilege remains undefined.   Since Reynolds, this Court has hinted that Arti-cle II may call for some version of a state secrets priv-ilege, given the president\\u2019s responsibilities in military and diplomatic affairs.  But none of the features of the privilege that actually exists has ever been linked to any constitutional imperatives.   Reynolds is still \\u201cthe only instance in which [this] Court has articulated a standard for the state secrets privilege.\\u201d  Setty, supra, at 208.  Comments made in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974), however, may provide \\u201cindirect support\\u201d for the idea that a priv-ilege against disclosing military and state secrets im-plicates presidential authority under the Constitution.  Chesney, supra, at 1294.  In rejecting President Nixon\\u2019s broad and undifferentiated claim of executive privilege, this Court implied that it might have ac-corded greater protection to his \\u201cinterest in confidenti-ality\\u201d in his \\u201cPresidential communications\\u201d if they had concerned \\u201cmilitary or diplomatic secrets.\\u201d  Nixon, 418 U.S. at 706, 711.  More generally, this Court stated that \\u201cto the extent\\u201d that an interest in confidentiality \\u201crelates to the effective discharge of a President\\u2019s pow-ers, it is constitutionally based.\\u201d  Id. at 711.  At the same time, however, this Court endorsed in camera ju-dicial review of subpoenaed presidential materials to excise any portions that might be privileged under Reynolds.  See id. at 715 n.21.   \\u201cNixon was not, of course, a state secrets privilege case,\\u201d and its allusion to the possibility of a different result if military or diplomatic matters had been \\n25 involved was dicta.  Chesney, supra, at 1294.  Still, this Court\\u2019s comments may suggest that some form of a state secrets privilege could be constitutionally com-pelled\\u2014at least with respect to \\u201cconfidential conversa-tions between a President and his close advisors.\\u201d  Nixon, 418 U.S. at 703.  \\u201cPlainly, however,\\u201d any such constitutional core \\u201cdoes not account for the full scope of the privilege as it has come to be understood.\\u201d  Chesney, supra, at 1309.  As discussed, the substan-tive and procedural standards that actually comprise the privilege did not result from an analysis of the Con-stitution.  Rather, they were imported from abroad and adopted in common law fashion without any con-sideration of Article II or the separation of powers. To assert that the state secrets privilege performs \\u201ca function of constitutional significance,\\u201d therefore, Pet. Br. 45 (quoting El-Masri v. United States, 479 F.3d 296, 304 (4th Cir. 2007)), is not so much wrong as it is misleading in its artful construction.  The ability to conceal information concerning national security may indeed make it easier for the executive branch to pursue the goals it has set in the realms of military or foreign affairs.  In that sense, any state secrets privi-lege adopted by the courts, whatever its scope or ra-tionale, would have \\u201cconstitutional significance.\\u201d  Id.  But it is a leap to jump from that observation to the conclusion that the state secrets privilege as we know it\\u2014fashioned in Reynolds as a matter of federal com-mon law\\u2014has \\u201ca firm foundation in the Constitution.\\u201d  Id. (quoting El-Masri, 479 F.3d at 304).  The history of the privilege belies that assertion. \\n26 III. Because the Question Here Implicates the Powers of All Three Branches of Government, the Analysis Should Not Be Slanted in Favor of the Executive.     Tipping the interpretive scales in the executive branch\\u2019s favor is inappropriate here for an additional reason: the state secrets privilege affects the constitu-tional powers of all three branches of government. \\u201cThe Constitution gives Congress near-plenary power to decide which kinds of Article III cases and controversies federal courts shall hear,\\u201d and the dis-missal of lawsuits as a result of the state secrets priv-ilege therefore \\u201cintrudes not just on the power of courts and the rights of individuals, but on the jurisdiction-conferring authority of the legislature as well.\\u201d  Amanda Frost, The State Secrets Privilege and Sepa-ration of Powers, 75 Fordham L. Rev. 1931, 1932 (2007); see In re United States, 872 F.2d 472, 477 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (\\u201c[D]enial of the forum provided under the Constitution for the resolution of disputes, U.S. Const. art. III, \\u00a7 2, is a drastic remedy . . . .\\u201d).  Further, when the executive branch uses the state secrets privilege \\u201cto obtain dismissals of suits alleging government misconduct or unconstitutional behavior,\\u201d it \\u201craises special concerns relating to democratic ac-countability and the rule of law.\\u201d  Chesney, supra, at 1308.  While the judiciary has no \\u201croving writ to ferret out and strike down executive excess,\\u201d El-Masri, 479 F.3d at 312, the Framers intended that in resolving \\u201cCases\\u201d and \\u201cControversies,\\u201d U.S. Const. art. III, \\u00a7 2, cl. 1, and \\u201cdecid[ing] on the rights of individuals,\\u201d Mar-bury, 5 U.S. at 170, the federal courts would rein in unlawful abuses by the executive branch, preserving the rights secured by federal law \\u201cfrom all violation from every quarter,\\u201d Cohens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. 264, 388 (1821); see 1 Annals of Cong. 457 (1789) (Joseph \\n27 Gales ed., 1834) (James Madison) (\\u201cindependent tribu-nals of justice will consider themselves in a peculiar manner the guardians of those rights; they will be an impenetrable bulwark against every assumption of power in the legislative or executive\\u201d); The Federalist No. 78, at 466 (Alexander Hamilton) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961) (\\u201cWithout this, all the reservations of partic-ular rights or privileges would amount to nothing.\\u201d).   Critically, too, \\u201cpower over national security infor-mation does not rest solely with the president.\\u201d  In re NSA, 564 F. Supp. 2d at 1120-21.  Instead, \\u201cdecisions as to foreign policy . . . . are wholly confided by our Constitution to the political departments of the govern-ment, Executive and Legislative.\\u201d  Chicago & S. Air Lines v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 111 (1948) (emphasis added).  So too for decisions concerning mil-itary policy.  See Martin v. Mott, 25 U.S. 19, 28-29 (1827).  Indeed, Congress, not the president, is the \\u201cfi-nal arbiter of military and diplomatic policy.\\u201d  James Zagel, The State Secrets Privilege, 50 Minn. L. Rev. 875, 896 (1966); see id. at 896 n.82 (\\u201cThe presidential powers over treaties and the armed forces are subject either to outright congressional veto or to implied veto by virtue of Congress\\u2019 control over appointments and appropriations.\\u201d). In line with this constitutional structure, Congress has empowered the judiciary \\u201cto hear cases in which executive power is challenged\\u201d by giving it \\u201cbroad fed-eral question jurisdiction, and by enacting specific statutory limits on executive power in the area of na-tional security, such as in the Foreign Intelligence Sur-veillance Act.\\u201d  Frost, supra, at 1954-55.  When the state secrets privilege restricts the breadth of that ju-risdiction and the effectiveness of those limits, it af-fects the constitutional roles of Congress and the fed-eral courts. \\n28 Thus, when the question is whether a statute en-acted by the legislature permits the judiciary to adju-dicate allegations that the executive has violated the law, the answer implicates the constitutional powers of all three branches of government.  Skewing that statutory analysis in favor of the executive is unwar-ranted. * * * In sum, there is no justification for distorting the normal approach to statutory interpretation here by demanding a showing \\u201cthat Congress was unmistaka-bly clear,\\u201d Pet. Br. 16 (quoting Pet. App. 110a), when it displaced the state secrets privilege in FISA.  This Court should do what it normally does: interpret the statute to discern its meaning.

EPIC routinely participates as amicus curiae before this Court and other courts in cases concern-ing privacy issues, new technologies, and constitu-tional interests. See, e.g., Carpenter v. United States, No. 16-402 (2017) (arguing that the Fourth Amend-ment protects the right against warrantless seizure and search of location data); State v. Earls, 214 N.J. 564 (2013) (same); Packingham v. North Carolina, 137 S. Ct. 1730 (2017) (arguing that the First Amendment protects the right to access speech from the privacy of a personal electronic device); Utah v. Streiff, 136 S. Ct. 2056 (2016) (arguing that evidence obtained via suspicionless identification should be suppressed); Riley v. California, 134 S. Ct. 2473 (2014) (arguing that it is unreasonable to warrant-lessly search a cell phone incident to an arrest); Flor-ida v. Harris, 133 S. Ct. 1050 (2013) (arguing that the government bears the burden of establishing the reliability of new investigative techniques used in es-tablishing probable cause for a search); United States                                                 1 Both parties consent to the filing of this brief. In accord-ance with Rule 37.6, the undersigned states that no mone-tary contributions were made for the preparation or sub-mission of this brief, and this brief was not authored, in whole or in part, by counsel for a party. \\n2 \\n v. Jones, 565 U.S. 400 (2012) (arguing that warrant-less tracking of a car using a GPS device violates the Fourth Amendment); Commonwealth v. Connolly, 454 Mass. 808 (2009) (same). EPIC seeks to ensure that the statutory pro-tections established by Congress to safeguard privacy are fully enforced by the courts. This case presents a fundamental question about the obligation of the courts to comply with the plain text of 18 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2518(10)(a), the suppression remedy for an inter-ception that is unlawful, supported by insufficient authorization, or not in conformity with authoriza-tion or approval. EPIC submits this amicus brief in support of petitioners. SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT In recent years, this Court has considered sev-eral important privacy cases, arising from new tech-nologies, that present important constitutional ques-tions. This is not such a case. This case is about the authority of Congress to enact statutes to safeguard privacy. The suppression and exclusion provisions in the Wiretap Act, 18 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2515, 2518(10), are broad and unambiguous, and it is the responsibility of the courts to ensure they are enforced. Congress has made clear that wiretap orders cannot authorize surveillance beyond a court\\u2019s jurisdictional boundary. Any order that does is facially invalid and triggers suppression of evidence under the plain text of \\u00a7 2518(10). If the government wishes a different out-come, then it should go to Congress to revise the statute. It is not for the Court to undo the statutory provisions. \\n3 \\n The Wiretap Act was enacted by Congress in 1968 to respond to this Court\\u2019s rulings in Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41 (1967), and Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967). The purpose of the Act is to protect the privacy of communications, to strictly limit unauthorized and unlawful interception, and to ensure meaningful enforcement of statutory rights. Congress has subsequently amended the Wiretap Act on several occasions, and may choose to do so again to provide, for example, specific rules governing cell phone location information. But it is not for the courts to create atextual exceptions to the suppres-sion and exclusion provisions in the Wiretap Act. The lower court\\u2019s decision should be overturned. ARGUMENT I. Congress enacted broad and unambigu-ous suppression and exclusion provisions in the Wiretap Act to minimize unlawful or unauthorized surveillance and to en-sure compliance with the Act. The provisions for exclusion and suppression in Sections 2515 and 2518 are \\u201cintegral\\u201d to the priva-cy regime established in the Wiretap Act. S. Rep. 90-1097, at 96 (1968), as reprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2112, 2185 [\\u201cSenate Committee Report\\u201d]. The statu-tory provisions are intended to minimize unlawful or unauthorized interception and ensure compliance with the Act. There is no basis in the text, history, or purpose of the Wiretap Act for judicially manufac-tured limitations on the law\\u2019s unambiguous provi-sions. In the privacy realm, the Court appropriately determines the bounds of the Fourth Amendment. But the Court should leave it to Congress to make changes to privacy protections established by statute. \\n4 \\n The \\u201ccore purpose\\u201d of the Wiretap Act is to strictly limit unlawful or unauthorized interception and to \\u201cprotect the privacy of individuals by banning eavesdropping other than by duly authorized law en-forcement officers who complied with the safeguards provided by the law.\\u201d Edith J. Lapidus, Eavesdrop-ping on Trial 7 (1974). The law accomplishes this in three distinct ways: (1) by generally prohibiting un-authorized interception and providing for civil reme-dies, 18 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2511, 2520; (2) by criminally sanc-tioning both unlawful interception and the facilita-tion of unlawful interception through manufacture and distribution of \\u201cintercepting devices,\\u201d 18 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2511, 2512; and (3) by establishing specific proce-dures that courts and law enforcement officers must follow in order to be authorized to intercept commu-nications in criminal investigations, 18 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2516\\u201318. In order to ensure that these rules would be enforced, Congress provided a full range of remedies: damages, criminal penalties, injunctive relief, and suppression of evidence derived from an unlawful or unauthorized interception. Congress also established an extensive reporting scheme to facilitate public oversight of the use of Wiretap authority. 18 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2519. See generally EPIC, Wiretapping (2017).2 Congress made clear from the outset that the exclusionary rule is essential to the Wiretap Act\\u2019s ro-bust privacy protections and therefore should not be limited. The Senate Judiciary Committee described the broad exclusionary provision in \\u00a7 2515 as \\u201cneces-sary and proper to protect privacy\\u201d and \\u201can integral part of the system of limitations designed to protect privacy.\\u201d Senate Committee Report, supra, at 96. Pri-                                                2 https://epic.org/privacy/wiretap/. \\n5 \\n or to 1968, the idea of authorizing interception of pri-vate communications was so controversial that Con-gress failed repeatedly to pass any statutes authoriz-ing wiretapping. See Edward V. Long, The Intruders 153\\u201354 (1967); Lapidus, supra, at 11. Congress intended section 2518(10)(a)\\u2014the provision that provides standing to file a motion to suppress\\u2014to provide \\u201cthe remedy for the right creat-ed by section 2515.\\u201d Senate Committee Report, supra at 106. The Senate Committee Report cautioned that \\u201c[o]nly by striking at all aspects of the problem can privacy be adequately protected.\\u201d Id. at 69. Accord-ingly, the law provides for criminal, civil, and eviden-tiary remedies. Id. These three remedies were in-tended \\u201cto guarantee that the standards of the new chapter will sharply curtail the unlawful interception of wire and oral communications.\\u201d Id. at 96.  Congress also intended the exclusionary rule to be a sanction for those law enforcement officers that engaged in unlawful wiretapping. The report de-scribes section 2515\\u2019s exclusionary rule as an \\u201cevi-dentiary sanction.\\u201d Id. The Senate report also states that the \\u201cperpetrator must be denied the fruits of his unlawful action in civil and criminal proceedings.\\u201d Id. at 69. This indicates that Congress intended the pro-vision to have a deterrent effect on officers, prevent-ing future unlawful wiretapping. These strict limita-tions on the use of wiretap evidence are consistent with the law that existed post-Olmstead. See Samuel Dash, The Eavesdroppers 387\\u2013400 (1959) (discussing Section 605 of the Federal Communications Act and the early post-Olmstead cases interpreting the exclu-sionary rule). \\n6 \\n When Congress ultimately adopted sections 2515 and 2518(10), it used unambiguous language that prohibits the use of evidence obtained in viola-tion of Title III; those provisions should be applied broadly and without exception. The Senate indicated \\u201cthat all unauthorized interception of such communi-cation should be prohibited, as well as the use of the contents of unauthorized interceptions as evidence in courts and administrative hearings.\\u201d Senate Commit-tee Report, supra, at 89 [emphasis added]. Indeed, the only limitation on the broad exclusionary rule is the requirement that the movant be an \\u201caggrieved person\\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2510(11). As the Senate Committee Report explained, they did not intend \\u201cto change the general rule\\u201d governing grand jury pro-ceedings or \\u201cto grant jurisdiction to Federal courts over Congress itself,\\u201d but provided that \\u201c[o]therwise the scope of the provision is intended to be compre-hensive.\\u201d Senate Committee Report, supra, at 106. Judicially crafted exceptions to the exclusionary rule on the basis of a change in technology would be in-consistent with this intent for a comprehensive scope.  The meaning of the exclusion and suppression provisions in the Wiretap Act are also informed by the cases that preceded their adoption. Although members of the Court have subsequently disagreed over the scope of the constitutional exclusionary rule, the statutory rule in the Wiretap Act should be inter-preted based on both its text and the law as it existed in 1968. In the decade leading up to the Act\\u2019s pas-sage, the Court in Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961), established that \\u201cthe exclusionary rule is an essential part of both the Fourth and Fourteenth Amend-ments.\\u201d Mapp, 367 U.S. at 657. Justice Black\\u2019s con-curring opinion in Mapp noted that \\u201cwhen the Fourth \\n7 \\n Amendment's ban against unreasonable searches and seizures is considered together with the Fifth Amendment's ban against compelled self-incrimination, a constitutional basis emerges which not only justifies but actually requires the exclusion-ary rule.\\u201d Id. at 662 (Black, J., concurring). The Court had previously recognized this right as stemming from a combination of Fourth and Fifth Amendment protections. See Agnello v. United States, 269 U.S. 20, 33\\u201334 (1925) (\\u201cIt is well settled that, when properly invoked, the Fifth Amendment protects every person from incrimination by the use of evidence obtained through search or seizure made in violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment.\\u201d). As Justice Stewart explained in his seminal lecture, the exclusionary rule serves an important de-terrent function that is not matched by other reme-dies\\u2014criminal prosecutions, injunctions, and civil damages\\u2014which have a limited application in the law enforcement context. See Potter Stewart, The Road to Mapp v. Ohio and Beyond: The Origins, De-velopment and Future of the Exclusionary Rule in Search-and-Seizure Cases, 83 Colum. L. Rev. 1365, 1386\\u201389 (1983). Criminal prosecutions are seen as a severe penalty for law enforcement officers, and thus are limited to \\u201cwillful\\u201d violations. Id. at 1386. Injunc-tions require proof of widespread constitutional viola-tions to establish likelihood of a future violation. Id. at 1389. And civil damages are both expensive to pursue and difficult to prove due to deference given to law enforcement officers. Id. at 1387\\u201388. Justice Stewart, writing for the Court in Elkins v. United States, 364 U.S. 206 (1960), found that the exclusionary rule \\u201ccompel[s] respect for the \\n8 \\n constitutional guaranty in the only effectively availa-ble way\\u2014by removing the incentive to disregard it.\\u201d Elkins, 364 U.S. at 217. The exclusionary rule is con-stitutionally required not as a right \\u201cbut as a remedy necessary to ensure that those prohibitions are ob-served in fact.\\u201d Stewart, supra, at 1380. Whether the exclusionary rule is understood as a right enshrined in the Constitution or as a remedy that is constitu-tionally required to make the Fourth Amendment meaningful in practice, it was well established by 1968 that an exclusionary remedy was necessary to preserve privacy.  Congress enacted the broad exclusionary rule in the Wiretap Act following the expansion of the remedy in Mapp v. Ohio and prior to any of the sub-sequent limitations imposed in the constitutional context. After Elkins, Mapp, and Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), the broad scope and application of the suppression remedy was solidified. That is the broad principle that Congress embraced in Title III. As Professor Murphy explained, \\u201cthe exclusionary rule was effectively mandated as regards Title III, because Katz v. United States and Berger v. New York had already made it clear that improper wiretapping violated the Constitution.\\u201d Erin Murphy, The Politics of Privacy in the Criminal Justice System: Infor-mation Disclosure, the Fourth Amendment, and Stat-utory Law Enforcement Exemptions, 111 Mich. L. Rev. 485, 522 (2013). The Court has had occasion since that time to qualify somewhat the availability of exclusion as a pure constitutional remedy. See Aziz Z. Huq, Judicial Independence and the Rationing of Constitutional Remedies, 65 Duke L.J. 1, 17\\u201320 (2015). But it is not necessary to impose new limits or qualifications on \\n9 \\n the statutory remedy in the Wiretap Act, which have been clearly set out by Congress. Title III is not the only statute where Congress has chosen to create a suppression remedy. In the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988, 18 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2710, Congress also enacted a broad and unambig-uous exclusionary rule like the one in the Wiretap Act.  Personally identifiable information ob-tained in any manner other than as pro-vided in this section shall not be re-ceived in evidence in any trial, hearing, arbitration, or other proceeding in or be-fore any court, grand jury, department, officer, agency, regulatory body, legisla-tive committee, or other authority of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State. 18 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2710(d). See Murphy, supra, at 522\\u201326. It would raise substantial separation of powers concerns for the courts to narrow Congress\\u2019 authority to enact statutory suppression remedies based on a judicial determination as to the statute\\u2019s \\u201ccore\\u201d pur-pose where there is no support in the text or history of the Act to reach such a result. II. Where Congress has provided a broad and unambiguous suppression remedy, courts should not create atextual excep-tions.  The Wiretap Act provides detailed rules that limit the government\\u2019s ability to intercept private communications. Congress has since updated the law to carry forward the purpose of the 1968 Act and to reflect significant changes in the technology. As Jus-\\n10 \\n tice Alito has explained, \\u201cIn circumstances involving dramatic technological change, the best solution to privacy concerns may be legislative. A legislative body is well situated to gauge changing public atti-tudes, to draw detailed lines, and to balance privacy and public safety in a comprehensive way.\\u201d United States v. Jones, 565 U.S. 400, 427\\u201328 (2012) (Alito, J., concurring) (internal citations omitted). This process of technological refinement in statutory privacy law, where Congress defines protections and courts apply those definitions to emerging technologies, is ongoing and important. Congress also has the ability to conduct de-tailed fact-finding and develop clear rules set out in public law. Professors Gray and Citron write, \\u201cthe law enforcement and privacy interests at stake can be explored in a more expansive and timely manner in the context of legislative or executive rule making processes than they can be in the context of constitu-tional litigation.\\u201d David Gray & Danielle Citron, The Right to Quantitative Privacy, 98 Minn. L. Rev. 62, 110 (2013). Professor Murphy has stated, \\u201cCongress has proven more adept than the courts at implement-ing mechanisms for systemic oversight of privacy practices, as well as for reform of noncompliant insti-tutions.\\u201d Murphy, supra, at 535.  Congress looks to the Court\\u2019s constitutional guidance to enact privacy legislation \\u201cthat draws rea-sonable distinctions based on categories of infor-mation or [] other variables.\\u201d Riley v. California, 134 S. Ct. 2473, 2497 (2014) (Alito, J., concurring). As Justice Alito explained in Riley, \\u201cThe regulation of electronic surveillance provides an instructive exam-ple\\u201d of Congress\\u2019s complementary role in defining \\n11 \\n privacy protections. Id. In 1967, the Court struck down a New York statute because it permitted elec-tronic eavesdropping \\u201cwithout requiring belief that any particular offense ha[d] been or [was] being committed\\u201d and without requiring that the \\u201cconversa-tions [sought] be particularly described.\\u201d Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41, 58-59 (1967). Later that term, the Court held that warrantless eavesdropping on a telephone booth violated the Fourth Amendment be-cause it intruded on the caller\\u2019s reasonable expecta-tion of privacy. Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 358-59 (1967); id. at 360 (Harlan, J., concurring). This Court has recognized the importance of judicial deference and treading carefully so as not to usurp the role of Congress. Chief Justice Roberts em-phasized that, \\u201cin every case we must respect the role of the Legislature, and take care not to undo what it has done.\\u201d King v. Burwell, 135 S. Ct. 2480, 2495 (2015). Justice Scalia cited Justice Brennan in cau-tioning \\u201cjudges [] to refrain from substituting their own interstitial lawmaking.\\u201d City of Arlington, Tex. v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 304\\u201305 (2013) (citing Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, 444 U.S. 555, 568 (1980)). Where Congress has gone through the effort of creat-ing a broad and unambiguous suppression remedy, as it has done in the Wiretap Act, the Court should heed deference to Congress.  Since Title III was enacted in 1968, Congress has passed several amendments to the Wiretap Act, including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-508, 100 Stat. 1848 [\\u201cECPA\\u201d], and the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, Pub. L. 103-414, 108 Stat. 4279 (1994) [\\u201cCALEA\\u201d]. Congress passed ECPA to \\u201cupdate and \\n12 \\n clarify Federal privacy protections and standards in light of dramatic changes in new computer and tele-communications technologies.\\u201d S. Rep. 99-541, at 1 (1986), as reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555, 3555. Eight years later, Congress again amended the law, in part, to extend protections \\u201cto cordless phones and certain data communications transmitted by radio.\\u201d H.R. Rep. 103-827, at 10 (1994), as reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3489, 3490. In both instances, Congress made the determination that changes in technology had altered the communications landscape in a way that required legislative action. But Congress has not amended the Wiretap Act to provide for authorization of interception across jurisdictional boundaries. The district court\\u2019s attempt to do so was a direct violation of the statute, making the order facially invalid. Congress clearly knew how to provide authority for cross-jurisdictional wiretap-ping where it determined that such authorization was proper. In ECPA, Congress both extended Wire-tap Act protections to electronic communications and provided specific authority for the interception of oral communications across jurisdictional boundaries in a specific, narrow context: where law enforcement sought to use a \\u201cmobile tracking device.\\u201d 18 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2518(3).  The \\u201cmobile tracking device\\u201d provision was en-acted for a specific purpose: to enable the authoriza-tion to use \\u201ca tap\\u201d that is \\u201cinstalled on a vehicle.\\u201d S. Rep. 99-541, supra, at 30. Congress recognized that \\u201c[i]n certain cases . . . a device authorized for installa-tion in an automobile may be authorized in one dis-trict and the vehicle might be moved to another dis-trict prior to installation.\\u201d Id. Congress decided in \\n13 \\n ECPA that, with an appropriate court order, the gov-ernment has the authority to complete \\u201cinstallation in the district to which the vehicle has been moved.\\u201d Id. This is precisely the type of narrow solution to a specific problem that Congress is capable of enacting when necessary.  But if a court simply ignores the jurisdictional limitation altogether by refusing to enforce the exclu-sionary rule when it is violated, then Congress would never have the occasion to review and update the law. Indeed, it is directly contrary to Congress\\u2019 intent for the court to deny the remedy outlined in the stat-ute (suppression of evidence) even when the jurisdic-tional limitation provision was violated. Suppression of evidence acquired in violation of Title III is not op-tional, it is required under the statute. 18 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2515. Accordingly, the courts should defer to Con-gress to make any changes to the statutory scheme in response to emerging technologies, rather than adopt an atextual exemption by judicial fiat.  The Court and Congress have long worked to-gether to determine the scope of the right to privacy. Marc Rotenberg & David Brody, Protecting Privacy: The Role of the Courts and Congress, Hum.

The Wiretap Act was drafted in response to this Court\\u2019s opinions in Berger and Katz. The drafters considered the cases to be authori-tative pronouncements of the necessary procedures for constitutional wiretaps. See S. Rep. 90-1097 (1968), as reprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2112, 2153 (asserting \\u201c[i]n the course of the [Berger] Opinion the \\n14 \\n Court delineated the constitutional criteria that elec-tronic surveillance legislation should contain.

She also has a master's degree in bioethics and completed the National Catholic Bioethics Center ethics certificate course. In addition to her full-time clinical duties within the neonatal intensive care unit of a large regional medical center, Dr. Pierucci remains active in perinatal palliative care, and ongoing performance improvement projects.  She has multiple publications in peer and non-peer reviewed journals and has spoken around the country on multiple perinatal and ethical topics.  As an expert in caring for extremely young premature babies, Dr. Pierucci understands that medical science provides only limited ability to determine neonatal survival and that such a determination is best made by trained and experienced neonatologists, not abortion providers.  Dr. Pierucci contests the disconnect between two standards of care that are allowed under current law: the same patient that neonatologists such as herself are ethically, medically, and legally responsible to treat, obstetricians can legally abort. While the law currently allows two standards of care, the science informs us that a unique human \\t\\t1  This brief was wholly authored by counsel for amici Robin Pierucci, M.D. and Life Legal Defense Foundation.

Though human beings look different at different stages of development (e.g., embryo, fetus, neonate, toddler, adolescent, adult, elderly), we are always human beings. Because we are always human beings, doctors always have the obligation to provide the best care possible, and the state will always have an equal obligation to safeguard all its members. Amicus Life Legal Defense Foundation is a California non-profit 501(c)(3) public interest legal and educational organization that works to assist and support those who advocate in defense of life. Its mission is to give innocent and helpless human beings of any age, particularly unborn children, a trained and committed defense against the threat of death, and to support their advocates in the nation's courtrooms. Life Legal Defense Foundation believes life begins at the moment of conception and does not end until natural death. We litigate cases to protect human life, from preborn babies targeted by a billion-dollar abortion industry to the elderly, disabled, and medically vulnerable denied life-sustaining care.  Life Legal Defense Foundation sees in the present case an opportunity for this Court to right a 47-year-old wrong: the stripping from states of their authority to protect the lives of innocent human beings within their borders.  SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT  The Fifth Circuit held that the State of Mississippi's Gestational Age Act was an \\n \\t3 \\n unconstitutional ban on pre-viability abortions, based on Supreme Court precedent in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992). Cert. Pet. App.  13a. The lower court noted that, although viability \\\"may differ with each pregnancy\\\" and is dependent on a variety of factors, nonetheless \\\"viability is the critical point.\\\"  Id. at 12a and n. 34 (quoting Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 388-89 (1979)).  Because of this Court's precedents, the Fifth Circuit was forced to adhere to a legal framework this Court has never explained.  This Court first bestowed constitutional significance on the concept of viability in its abortion jurisprudence in 1973, at which time it stated, \\\"Viability is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks.\\\" Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 160 (1973). Within two decades, that already generous window has shifted by several weeks.2 More importantly, as this brief will demonstrate, viability outside the womb depends on a variety of external and subjective factors, including individual physicians' competence, continuing education in neonatal medicine, personal and institutional philosophies of the \\t\\t2 See, e.g., Isaacson v. Horne, 716 F.3d 1213, 1233 (9th Cir. 2013) (Kleinfeld, J., concurring) (\\\"Viability is the 'critical fact' that controls constitutionality. That is an odd rule, because viability changes as medicine changes. As Planned Parenthood v. Casey noted, between Roe v. Wade in 1973 and the time Casey was decided in 1992, viability dropped from 28 weeks to 23 or 24 weeks, because medical science became more effective at preserving the lives of premature babies.\\\")  \\n \\t4 \\n provision of life-sustaining medical interventions, and physician attitudes toward disabilities and societal challenges.  Amici join Petitioner Dobbs in urging this Court to revisit the doctrine of viability and clarify that the State's interest in preserving the life of human beings in the womb is not contingent on the entirely unrelated question of the possible medical outcomes if the mother went into labor and delivered the child prematurely.  This Court should grant the Petition and reverse the judgment of the Fifth Circuit.  ARGUMENT  I. THE VIABILITY BENCHMARK WITH ROE CONFLICTS WITH THIS COURT'S DETERMINATION THAT THERE IS AN UNQUALIFIED COMPELLING STATE INTEREST IN PRESERVING HUMAN LIFE.   In Cruzan v. Dir., Mo. Dep't of Health, 497 U.S. 261 (1990), this Court found that the state not only has an interest in protecting an individual's right to life, but also has \\\"an interest in life\\\" itself. Id. at 281. This holding was consistent with the Court's finding in Roe v. Wade that the state has an \\\"important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life.\\\" Roe, 410 U.S. at 162.  In both cases, the state's interest in life and in protecting human life were weighed against an \\n \\t5 \\n individual's constitutional rights (right to due process and right to privacy, respectively).  In Roe, this Court determined that the state's interest in the protection of human life became compelling at viability, relying on the fetus' \\\"capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb.\\\" Id. at 163. By contrast, in Cruzan this Court rejected the idea of \\\"meaningful life,\\\" holding that \\\"a State may properly decline to make judgments about the 'quality' of life that a particular individual may enjoy, and simply assert an unqualified interest in the preservation of human life to be weighed against the constitutionally protected interests of the individual.\\\" Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 282; Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 729 (1997) (quoting Cruzan and holding that the state \\\"has an unqualified interest in the preservation of human life\\\") (emphasis added). See also Britell v. United States, 372 F.3d 1370, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (\\\"It is not the role of the courts to draw lines as to which fetal abnormalities or birth defects are so severe as to negate the state's otherwise legitimate interest in the fetus' potential life.\\\"); State v. Final Exit Network, Inc., 889 N.W.2d 296, 305-06 (Minn. Ct. App. 2016) (\\\"The state has a compelling interest in the preservation of D.D.'s life, and the prevention of her suicide, regardless of her incurable [non-viable] condition.\\\")   Limiting a state's ability to protect human lives directly to only those lives deemed \\\"meaningful\\\" because the arbitrary benchmark of viability has been reached is in direct conflict with this Court's 1990 holding in Cruzan, that a state \\n \\t6 \\n need not qualify its interest in the preservation of human life before acting.    This Court should grant the petition to resolve the conflict between its abortion jurisprudence and its decisions in Cruzan and Glucksberg allowing states to protect human life regardless of the \\\"meaningfulness\\\" of that life as measured by the uncertain yardstick of viability.  II. THERE IS NO \\\"POINT\\\" IN PREGNANCY AT WHICH VIABILITY \\\"OCCURS.\\\"   In Roe, this Court established viability as the \\\"point\\\" at which the state's interest in protecting human life becomes compelling, allowing the state to prohibit abortion. The Court defined viable as \\\"potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid.\\\" Roe, 410 U.S. at 160. One commentator noted that, with this holding, this Court \\\"seems to mistake a definition for a syllogism.\\\"3 Indeed, this Court has never attempted to elaborate on why a child's ability or inability to survive outside the womb in the case of a premature delivery has any bearing on the state's interest in protecting the child from being killed inside the womb.  In Roe, the Court could not locate the so-called \\\"point\\\" of viability more precisely than to say that it is \\\"usually placed about seven months (28 \\t\\t3 John Hart Ely, The Wages of Crying Wolf: A Comment on Roe v. Wade, 82 YALE L. J. 920, 924 (1973). \\n \\t7 \\n weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks.\\\" Id. Thus, even as first enunciated by this Court, the \\\"point\\\" when viability \\\"occurred\\\" ranged across 10% of a full-term 40-week pregnancy.4 A few years later, this Court acknowledged that multiple factors go into the assessment of viability including \\\"fetal weight, based on an inexact estimate of the size and condition of the uterus; the woman's general health and nutrition; the quality of the available medical facilities; and other factors.\\\" Colautti, 439 U.S. at 395-96 (emphasis added). In other words, there is no \\\"point\\\" of viability in pregnancy generally, or even in any particular pregnancy.  It gets worse. Colautti assigned the role of assessing the viability of the fetus to the \\\"responsible attending physician,\\\" i.e., the abortion provider. However, to the extent any given abortion provider has relevant5 specialized training, such training would be in obstetrics, not neonatology.  Abortion providers are unlikely to stay current on medical advancements for infant survival. The largest abortion provider networks, Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the National Abortion Federation, offer continuing \\t\\t4 Pregnancy is commonly dated from the onset of the mother's last menstrual period (LMP), approximately two weeks before conception. All gestational ages described in this brief are dated from LMP.  5 Relevant as opposed to specialized training in, e.g., radiology or ophthalmology. Cf. June Medical Servs. L. L. C. et al. v. Russo. 2020 LEXIS 3516 at 116 (2020) (abortion provider \\\"hired a radiologist and ophthalmologist to do abortions\\\"). \\n \\t8 \\n medical education on clinical abortion procedure but not on infant viability.6 The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology follows the same pattern, focusing its continuing education offerings related to abortion on maternal care, not infant viability.7 Neonatologists, not obstetricians, are the experts in viability.  Unsurprisingly, the presence or absence of specialized training makes a noticeable difference in how physicians practice as well. A 2015 study by the Indiana University School of Medicine found that obstetricians and neonatologists approach patient consultations in drastically different ways. Obstetricians tend to discuss topics like maternal health risks, while neonatologists focus on post-birth complications and treatment options for the \\t\\t6 Among abortion providers, infant survival is a \\\"complication\\\" to be carefully avoided.

Injecting further subjectivity into the viability calculus is the fact that a physician's personal philosophy and attitude regarding the provision of life-sustaining medical interventions impacts the actual survival rate of an infant. Study after study throughout the world has shown that offering immediate life-sustaining treatment to preemies is the largest modifiable factor affecting infant survival.9   Compare, for example, the difference in survival rates between two American neonatal \\t\\t8 B. Tucker Edmonds, F. McKenzie, et al., Comparing Obstetricians' and Neonatologists' Approaches to Periviable Counseling, 35 J. Perinatology 344 (May 2015). 9 See, e.g., C. H. Backes et al., Outcomes Following a Comprehensive Versus a Selective Approach for Infants Born at 22 Weeks of Gestation, 39 J. Perinatology 39, 45 (2019) (hospital that routinely provided prenatal corticoster-oid administration, neonatal resuscitation, and intensive care had substantially higher survival rates [53 percent] than the hospital that only selectively provided such care [8 percent]); J. Lorenz, Management decisions in extremely premature infants, 8 Seminars in Neonatology 475 (December 2003), available at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1084275603001180 (\\\"There is significant variability between developed nations in the survival of extremely premature infants among cohorts born within perinatal tertiary care centres. This is, at least to some degree, the result of differences in the aggressiveness of obstetrical and neonatal management at these gestational ages.\\\") \\n \\t10 \\n facilities that work with extremely pre-term births. At the University of Iowa, physicians default to immediate, active medical treatment for all pre-term infants starting at 22 weeks' gestation.10 These physicians have long seen over a 60% survival rate for babies in the 22-week category. Physicians at the University directly credit their default-to-treatment strategy for the high survival rate.11 By contrast, Providence Women and Children's Services of Oregon has a very different rate of survival for 22-week births. The physicians there have a facility-wide policy to not provide care for any 22-week births, regardless of the parents' wishes, and thus they have a 0% survival rate. Moreover, because the success of treatment rate is also dependent on the experience of doctors, Providence has a much lower survival rate for 23-week births, as well \\u2013 only 21%, compared to the national average of 38%.12 \\t\\t10 In a 2020 publication, University of Iowa neonatologists reported they provided immediate, active medical intervention for 97% of periviable births in their facility between 2006 and 2015. For the purposes of this study, a periviable birth was defined as a birth that occurred after 21 weeks' gestation, but before 26 weeks' gestation.  11 Keith Barrington, Active intervention at 22 weeks' gestation, is it futile?, Neonatal Research Blog (Oct. 29, 2018), available at https://neonatalresearch.org/2018/10/29/active-intervention -at-22-weeks-gestation-isit-futile/; P. Watkins, J. Dagle, et al., Outcomes at 18 to 22 Months of Corrected Age for Infants Born at 22 to 25 Weeks of Gestation in a Center Practicing Active Management, 217 J. Pediatrics 52 (Feb 2020). 12 Patrick J. Marmion, Periviability and the 'god committee,' 106 Acta Paediatrica 857 (Jun 2017). \\n \\t11 \\n  Clearly, the willingness of a neonatologists to provide active care to a baby after birth is a large factor in the child's chance of survival. The philosophy of defaulting against care lowers the survival rate, even for those children who do receive care. Conversely, when a facility defaults to immediate active medical intervention, survival rates of all treated neonates increase.13   The decision for or against medical care for premature babies is also shaped by attitudes toward disability. A November 2019 report from the National Council on Disability found:   [m]any healthcare providers critically undervalue life with a disability. Providers often perceive people with disabilities to have a low quality of life when, in reality, most report a high quality of life and level of happiness, especially when they have access to sufficient healthcare services and supports. This misperception has negatively influenced physicians' medical futility decisions and resulted in the withdrawal of necessary medical care from people with disabilities.14   \\t\\t13 M. A. Rysavy, A. Das, S. R.  Hintz, J. B. Stoll, B. R. Vohr, et al., Between-hospital variation in treatment and outcomes in extremely preterm infants, 372 New Engl. J. Med. 1801 (2015). 14 National Counsel on Disability, Medical Futility and Disability Bias, Bioethics and Disability Series at 10 (Nov. 2019).  \\n \\t12 \\n Such biases play a large role in setting institutional policies concerning whether to default against care in dealing with premature newborns, where there is an incorrect presumption that most if not all survivors will have severe disabilities.15 In discussing treatment decisions with parents, doctors may use the word futile as code to mean that the survival of the baby is not worth the cost of the treatment.16 Though various studies have shown that, when adjusted for future life expectancy, costs for NICU treatments are one-twentieth to one-tenth the costs of treatments for adult ICU patients,17 some researchers and doctors are reluctant to allow that the quality of life obtained is worth the treatment costs. In doing so, a circular dynamic is established where anticipated poor prognoses lead to denial of medical care, which in turn leads to poor outcomes and low survival rates, reinforcing the data underlying the original poor prognosis.   The same circularity can manifest itself with regard to social conditions. In 2018, the University of Texas released a report of the disparity between infant mortality rates from zip code to zip code.18 \\t\\t15 P. Watkins, J. Dagle, et al., Outcomes at 18 to 22 Months of Corrected Age for Infants Born at 22 to 25 Weeks of Gestation in a Center Practicing Active Management, 217 J. Pediatrics 52 (Feb 2020).

Nehme, et al., Infant mortality in communities across Texas, The University of Texas (2012). \\n \\t13 \\n Though Texas had an infant mortality rate lower than the national average, troubling findings were uncovered when some zip codes were shown to have disparities as high as 12 times the rates of neighboring zip codes.19 While all races had areas of high infant mortality, Black mothers had the highest rates of infant mortality overall.20 Even when a mother lives in a locale flooded with medical resources, a child's chance of survival can decrease if none of the local hospitals have enough experience in saving the lives of extremely premature babies. While generally speaking, the availability of a NICU in a geographical area increases chances of survival, when NICUs become more commonplace, each unit may see fewer individual cases of periviable births each year and, thus, have less experience in successfully treating these babies.21 This can then perpetuate the myth that active treatment is \\\"futile,\\\" which may indurate a physician's incorrect assumption that a child of a certain age or weight is simply non-viable.   In sum, this Court's assumption in Roe, Colautti, and Casey that there is a \\\"point\\\" in pregnancy when viability \\\"occurs\\\" is mistaken. Viability is a prediction, not a point. Even if there were such a point, it would be impossible for most doctors, especially abortion providers who rarely \\t\\t19 Id. at 7. 20 Id. at 12. 21  R. Patel, M.

Viability depends on myriad factors that vary and fluctuate both before and after birth, from the physical to the philosophical, from the personal to the institutional to the systemic.  III. ATTACHING CONSTITUTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE TO VIABILITY IS ILLOGICAL.   Why is any of this relevant to the case at issue? Mississippi's Gestational Age Act bans almost all abortions after 15 weeks' gestation. Petitioners have never suggested that an unborn child at 15 weeks' gestation is capable of sustained survival outside the womb under any circumstances, so why does uncertainty about the \\\"point\\\" of viability matter? It matters because this Court has built a constitutional framework on an illogical and imaginary premise, undeserving of the benefit of stare decisis.  As noted above, this Court's explanation in Roe of the significance of the non-existent \\\"point\\\" of viability consisted simply of restating the definition of viability. Colautti, in turn, took the significance of viability as a given, with no further attempt at explaining the logic behind it. Rather, Colautti emphasized that, because the point of viability (i.e., \\\"a reasonable probability of the fetus' sustained survival outside the womb\\\") is specific to each pregnancy and can be determined only by the attending physician, \\\"neither the legislature nor \\n \\t15 \\n the courts may proclaim one of the elements entering  into the ascertainment of viability -- be it weeks of gestation or fetal weight or any other single factor -- as the determinant of when the State has a compelling interest in the life or health of the fetus.\\\" Colautti, 439 U.S. at 388-389 (emphasis added). This Court has never revoked or modified Colautti's holding that an abortion ban based on gestational age is impermissible, and that determination of viability must be left to the judgment of the \\\"responsible attending\\\" abortion provider. As the years rolled by, dissenting justices continued to point out the illogic of attaching constitutional significance to viability, e.g.,    The governmental interest at issue is in protecting those who will be citizens if their lives are not ended in the womb. The substantiality of this interest is in no way dependent on the probability that the fetus may be capable of surviving outside the womb at any given point in its development, as the possibility of fetal survival is contingent on the state of medical practice and technology, factors that are in essence morally and constitutionally irrelevant. The State's interest is in the fetus as an entity in itself, and the character of this entity does not change at the point of viability under conventional medical wisdom. Accordingly, the State's interest, if compelling after viability, is equally compelling before viability. \\n \\t16 \\n  Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747, 795 (1986) (White, J., dissenting). See also, City of Akron v. Akron Ctr. for Reprod. Health, 462 U.S. 416, 461 (1983) (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (\\\"The choice of viability as the point at which the state interest in potential life becomes compelling is no less arbitrary than choosing any point before viability or any point afterward.\\\")   However, the plurality in Casey, relying on stare decisis, reaffirmed the Court's commitment to the constitutional significance of viability, even while acknowledging that its original judgment might have been unsound:  [V]iability marks the earliest point at which the State's interest in fetal life is constitutionally adequate to justify a legislative ban on nontherapeutic abortions. The soundness or unsoundness of that constitutional judgment in no sense turns on whether viability occurs at approximately 28 weeks, as was usual at the time of Roe, at 23 to 24 weeks, as it sometimes does today, or at some moment even slightly earlier in pregnancy, as it may if fetal respiratory capacity can somehow be enhanced in the future.  Casey, 505 U.S. at 860 (emphasis added). In affirming \\\"Roe's central holding,\\\" the Casey plurality also restated Roe's utterly false premise \\n \\t17 \\n that viability \\\"occurs\\\" at a \\\"point\\\" or \\\"moment\\\" in pregnancy. The Casey plurality made a self-conscious attempt to explain the reasoning behind the viability standard:  The second reason is that the concept of viability, as we noted in Roe, is the time at which there is a realistic possibility of maintaining and nourishing a life outside the womb, so that the independent existence of the second life can in reason and all fairness be the object of state protection that now overrides the rights of the woman.22   Casey, 505 U.S. at 870.  However, as Justice Scalia pointed out,  [t]he arbitrariness of the viability line is confirmed by the Court's inability to offer any justification for it beyond the conclusory \\t\\t22 This Court also half-heartedly offered a third justification for drawing a line a viability: \\\"The viability line also has, as a practical matter, an element of fairness. In some broad sense it might be said that a woman who fails to act before viability has consented to the State's intervention on behalf of the developing child.\\\" Casey, 505 U.S. at 870. However, given government data showing that over 90% of abortions are performed in the first trimester and over 98% by 20 weeks of pregnancy (CDC, Abortion Surveillance \\u2013 Findings and Reports (2016), available at https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/data_stats/abortion.htm), laches could be said, as a matter of fairness, to come into play well before viability.  \\n \\t18 \\n assertion that it is only at that point that the unborn child's life \\\"can in reason and all fairness\\\" be thought to override the interests of the mother. . . .  Precisely why is it that, at the magical second when machines currently in use (though not necessarily available to the particular woman) are able to keep an unborn child alive apart from its mother, the creature is suddenly able (under our Constitution) to be protected by law, whereas before that magical second it was not? That makes no more sense than according infants legal protection only after the point when they can feed themselves.  Id. at 989, fn. 5 (Scalia, J., concurring and dissenting).23  With a touch of unconscious irony, the Casey plurality distinguished the freedom of legislatures to \\\"draw lines which appear arbitrary without the necessity of offering a justification\\\" from its own duty to justify its line-drawing. Id. at 870. But no legal scholar has found this Court's justification persuasive, much less compelling.24 This Court's \\t\\t23 A closer analogy than Justice Scalia's might be found in the concept of \\\"pool safe,\\\" defined as the stage of development at which a child has a reasonable chance of survival if he or she accidentally falls into a swimming pool. Analogizing to viability, the state may act to protect the life of a pool-safe child, but may not act to protect a child who is not pool safe from being held face down in a bucket of water until dead.  24 See, e.g., Paul Benjamin Linton and Maura K. Quinlan, Does Stare Decisis Preclude Reconsideration of Roe v. Wade? A Critique of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 70 Case W. Res. L. \\n \\t19 \\n fictitious \\\"point of viability\\\" line has less justification than Mississippi's line of 15 weeks, based as the latter is on the science of fetal development, preservation of maternal health, and protection of medical ethics. Compare Pet. Cert. at 15-20 (examining viability standard) with id. at 20-26 (justification for 15-week abortion limit).   The Casey plurality also noted that \\\"there is no line other than viability which is more workable.\\\" Casey, 505 U.S. at 370. But, as demonstrated above, viability is not a line, or a point, or a moment, and for that reason, it is less \\\"workable,\\\" and certainly gives less notice, than a limit on abortion stated in weeks of gestational age justified by factors such as anatomical development, the capability of feeling pain, or the presence of a heartbeat. Viability as determined by the abortion provider is \\\"workable\\\" only in the sense that it is unenforceable, and thus does not give rise to difficult cases. It \\\"works\\\" for the abortion industry, but not for the state trying to protect unborn children.   \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_content_alt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 69,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"...................................................... 19\\t\\n ii \\n TABLE OF AUTHORITIES  CASES\\tBritell v.

She also has a master's degree in bioethics and completed the National Catholic Bioethics Center ethics certificate course. In addition to her full-time clinical duties within the neonatal intensive care unit of a large regional medical center, Dr. Pierucci remains active in perinatal palliative care, and ongoing performance improvement projects.  She has multiple publications in peer and non-peer reviewed journals and has spoken around the country on multiple perinatal and ethical topics.  As an expert in caring for extremely young premature babies, Dr. Pierucci understands that medical science provides only limited ability to determine neonatal survival and that such a determination is best made by trained and experienced neonatologists, not abortion providers.  Dr. Pierucci contests the disconnect between two standards of care that are allowed under current law: the same patient that neonatologists such as herself are ethically, medically, and legally responsible to treat, obstetricians can legally abort. While the law currently allows two standards of care, the science informs us that a unique human \\t\\t1  This brief was wholly authored by counsel for amici Robin Pierucci, M.D. and Life Legal Defense Foundation.

Though human beings look different at different stages of development (e.g., embryo, fetus, neonate, toddler, adolescent, adult, elderly), we are always human beings. Because we are always human beings, doctors always have the obligation to provide the best care possible, and the state will always have an equal obligation to safeguard all its members. Amicus Life Legal Defense Foundation is a California non-profit 501(c)(3) public interest legal and educational organization that works to assist and support those who advocate in defense of life. Its mission is to give innocent and helpless human beings of any age, particularly unborn children, a trained and committed defense against the threat of death, and to support their advocates in the nation's courtrooms. Life Legal Defense Foundation believes life begins at the moment of conception and does not end until natural death. We litigate cases to protect human life, from preborn babies targeted by a billion-dollar abortion industry to the elderly, disabled, and medically vulnerable denied life-sustaining care.  Life Legal Defense Foundation sees in the present case an opportunity for this Court to right a 47-year-old wrong: the stripping from states of their authority to protect the lives of innocent human beings within their borders.  SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT  The Fifth Circuit held that the State of Mississippi's Gestational Age Act was an \\n \\t3 \\n unconstitutional ban on pre-viability abortions, based on Supreme Court precedent in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992). Cert. Pet. App.  13a. The lower court noted that, although viability \\\"may differ with each pregnancy\\\" and is dependent on a variety of factors, nonetheless \\\"viability is the critical point.\\\"  Id. at 12a and n. 34 (quoting Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 388-89 (1979)).  Because of this Court's precedents, the Fifth Circuit was forced to adhere to a legal framework this Court has never explained.  This Court first bestowed constitutional significance on the concept of viability in its abortion jurisprudence in 1973, at which time it stated, \\\"Viability is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks.\\\" Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 160 (1973). Within two decades, that already generous window has shifted by several weeks.2 More importantly, as this brief will demonstrate, viability outside the womb depends on a variety of external and subjective factors, including individual physicians' competence, continuing education in neonatal medicine, personal and institutional philosophies of the \\t\\t2 See, e.g., Isaacson v. Horne, 716 F.3d 1213, 1233 (9th Cir. 2013) (Kleinfeld, J., concurring) (\\\"Viability is the 'critical fact' that controls constitutionality. That is an odd rule, because viability changes as medicine changes. As Planned Parenthood v. Casey noted, between Roe v. Wade in 1973 and the time Casey was decided in 1992, viability dropped from 28 weeks to 23 or 24 weeks, because medical science became more effective at preserving the lives of premature babies.\\\")  \\n \\t4 \\n provision of life-sustaining medical interventions, and physician attitudes toward disabilities and societal challenges.  Amici join Petitioner Dobbs in urging this Court to revisit the doctrine of viability and clarify that the State's interest in preserving the life of human beings in the womb is not contingent on the entirely unrelated question of the possible medical outcomes if the mother went into labor and delivered the child prematurely.  This Court should grant the Petition and reverse the judgment of the Fifth Circuit.  ARGUMENT  I. THE VIABILITY BENCHMARK WITH ROE CONFLICTS WITH THIS COURT'S DETERMINATION THAT THERE IS AN UNQUALIFIED COMPELLING STATE INTEREST IN PRESERVING HUMAN LIFE.   In Cruzan v. Dir., Mo. Dep't of Health, 497 U.S. 261 (1990), this Court found that the state not only has an interest in protecting an individual's right to life, but also has \\\"an interest in life\\\" itself. Id. at 281. This holding was consistent with the Court's finding in Roe v. Wade that the state has an \\\"important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life.\\\" Roe, 410 U.S. at 162.  In both cases, the state's interest in life and in protecting human life were weighed against an \\n \\t5 \\n individual's constitutional rights (right to due process and right to privacy, respectively).  In Roe, this Court determined that the state's interest in the protection of human life became compelling at viability, relying on the fetus' \\\"capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb.\\\" Id. at 163. By contrast, in Cruzan this Court rejected the idea of \\\"meaningful life,\\\" holding that \\\"a State may properly decline to make judgments about the 'quality' of life that a particular individual may enjoy, and simply assert an unqualified interest in the preservation of human life to be weighed against the constitutionally protected interests of the individual.\\\" Cruzan, 497 U.S. at 282; Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 729 (1997) (quoting Cruzan and holding that the state \\\"has an unqualified interest in the preservation of human life\\\") (emphasis added). See also Britell v. United States, 372 F.3d 1370, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (\\\"It is not the role of the courts to draw lines as to which fetal abnormalities or birth defects are so severe as to negate the state's otherwise legitimate interest in the fetus' potential life.\\\"); State v. Final Exit Network, Inc., 889 N.W.2d 296, 305-06 (Minn. Ct. App. 2016) (\\\"The state has a compelling interest in the preservation of D.D.'s life, and the prevention of her suicide, regardless of her incurable [non-viable] condition.\\\")   Limiting a state's ability to protect human lives directly to only those lives deemed \\\"meaningful\\\" because the arbitrary benchmark of viability has been reached is in direct conflict with this Court's 1990 holding in Cruzan, that a state \\n \\t6 \\n need not qualify its interest in the preservation of human life before acting.    This Court should grant the petition to resolve the conflict between its abortion jurisprudence and its decisions in Cruzan and Glucksberg allowing states to protect human life regardless of the \\\"meaningfulness\\\" of that life as measured by the uncertain yardstick of viability.  II. THERE IS NO \\\"POINT\\\" IN PREGNANCY AT WHICH VIABILITY \\\"OCCURS.\\\"   In Roe, this Court established viability as the \\\"point\\\" at which the state's interest in protecting human life becomes compelling, allowing the state to prohibit abortion. The Court defined viable as \\\"potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid.\\\" Roe, 410 U.S. at 160. One commentator noted that, with this holding, this Court \\\"seems to mistake a definition for a syllogism.\\\"3 Indeed, this Court has never attempted to elaborate on why a child's ability or inability to survive outside the womb in the case of a premature delivery has any bearing on the state's interest in protecting the child from being killed inside the womb.  In Roe, the Court could not locate the so-called \\\"point\\\" of viability more precisely than to say that it is \\\"usually placed about seven months (28 \\t\\t3 John Hart Ely, The Wages of Crying Wolf: A Comment on Roe v. Wade, 82 YALE L. J. 920, 924 (1973). \\n \\t7 \\n weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks.\\\" Id. Thus, even as first enunciated by this Court, the \\\"point\\\" when viability \\\"occurred\\\" ranged across 10% of a full-term 40-week pregnancy.4 A few years later, this Court acknowledged that multiple factors go into the assessment of viability including \\\"fetal weight, based on an inexact estimate of the size and condition of the uterus; the woman's general health and nutrition; the quality of the available medical facilities; and other factors.\\\" Colautti, 439 U.S. at 395-96 (emphasis added). In other words, there is no \\\"point\\\" of viability in pregnancy generally, or even in any particular pregnancy.  It gets worse. Colautti assigned the role of assessing the viability of the fetus to the \\\"responsible attending physician,\\\" i.e., the abortion provider. However, to the extent any given abortion provider has relevant5 specialized training, such training would be in obstetrics, not neonatology.  Abortion providers are unlikely to stay current on medical advancements for infant survival. The largest abortion provider networks, Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the National Abortion Federation, offer continuing \\t\\t4 Pregnancy is commonly dated from the onset of the mother's last menstrual period (LMP), approximately two weeks before conception. All gestational ages described in this brief are dated from LMP.  5 Relevant as opposed to specialized training in, e.g., radiology or ophthalmology. Cf. June Medical Servs. L. L. C. et al. v. Russo. 2020 LEXIS 3516 at 116 (2020) (abortion provider \\\"hired a radiologist and ophthalmologist to do abortions\\\"). \\n \\t8 \\n medical education on clinical abortion procedure but not on infant viability.6 The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology follows the same pattern, focusing its continuing education offerings related to abortion on maternal care, not infant viability.7 Neonatologists, not obstetricians, are the experts in viability.  Unsurprisingly, the presence or absence of specialized training makes a noticeable difference in how physicians practice as well. A 2015 study by the Indiana University School of Medicine found that obstetricians and neonatologists approach patient consultations in drastically different ways. Obstetricians tend to discuss topics like maternal health risks, while neonatologists focus on post-birth complications and treatment options for the \\t\\t6 Among abortion providers, infant survival is a \\\"complication\\\" to be carefully avoided.

Injecting further subjectivity into the viability calculus is the fact that a physician's personal philosophy and attitude regarding the provision of life-sustaining medical interventions impacts the actual survival rate of an infant. Study after study throughout the world has shown that offering immediate life-sustaining treatment to preemies is the largest modifiable factor affecting infant survival.9   Compare, for example, the difference in survival rates between two American neonatal \\t\\t8 B.

This is, at least to some degree, the result of differences in the aggressiveness of obstetrical and neonatal management at these gestational ages.\\\") \\n \\t10 \\n facilities that work with extremely pre-term births. At the University of Iowa, physicians default to immediate, active medical treatment for all pre-term infants starting at 22 weeks' gestation.10 These physicians have long seen over a 60% survival rate for babies in the 22-week category. Physicians at the University directly credit their default-to-treatment strategy for the high survival rate.11 By contrast, Providence Women and Children's Services of Oregon has a very different rate of survival for 22-week births. The physicians there have a facility-wide policy to not provide care for any 22-week births, regardless of the parents' wishes, and thus they have a 0% survival rate. Moreover, because the success of treatment rate is also dependent on the experience of doctors, Providence has a much lower survival rate for 23-week births, as well \\u2013 only 21%, compared to the national average of 38%.12 \\t\\t10 In a 2020 publication, University of Iowa neonatologists reported they provided immediate, active medical intervention for 97% of periviable births in their facility between 2006 and 2015. For the purposes of this study, a periviable birth was defined as a birth that occurred after 21 weeks' gestation, but before 26 weeks' gestation.  11 Keith Barrington, Active intervention at 22 weeks' gestation, is it futile?, Neonatal Research Blog (Oct. 29, 2018), available at https://neonatalresearch.org/2018/10/29/active-intervention -at-22-weeks-gestation-isit-futile/; P. Watkins, J. Dagle, et al., Outcomes at 18 to 22 Months of Corrected Age for Infants Born at 22 to 25 Weeks of Gestation in a Center Practicing Active Management, 217 J. Pediatrics 52 (Feb 2020). 12 Patrick J. Marmion, Periviability and the 'god committee,' 106 Acta Paediatrica 857 (Jun 2017). \\n \\t11 \\n  Clearly, the willingness of a neonatologists to provide active care to a baby after birth is a large factor in the child's chance of survival. The philosophy of defaulting against care lowers the survival rate, even for those children who do receive care. Conversely, when a facility defaults to immediate active medical intervention, survival rates of all treated neonates increase.13   The decision for or against medical care for premature babies is also shaped by attitudes toward disability. A November 2019 report from the National Council on Disability found:   [m]any healthcare providers critically undervalue life with a disability. Providers often perceive people with disabilities to have a low quality of life when, in reality, most report a high quality of life and level of happiness, especially when they have access to sufficient healthcare services and supports. This misperception has negatively influenced physicians' medical futility decisions and resulted in the withdrawal of necessary medical care from people with disabilities.14   \\t\\t13 M. A.

Med. 1801 (2015). 14 National Counsel on Disability, Medical Futility and Disability Bias, Bioethics and Disability Series at 10 (Nov. 2019).  \\n \\t12 \\n Such biases play a large role in setting institutional policies concerning whether to default against care in dealing with premature newborns, where there is an incorrect presumption that most if not all survivors will have severe disabilities.15 In discussing treatment decisions with parents, doctors may use the word futile as code to mean that the survival of the baby is not worth the cost of the treatment.16 Though various studies have shown that, when adjusted for future life expectancy, costs for NICU treatments are one-twentieth to one-tenth the costs of treatments for adult ICU patients,17 some researchers and doctors are reluctant to allow that the quality of life obtained is worth the treatment costs. In doing so, a circular dynamic is established where anticipated poor prognoses lead to denial of medical care, which in turn leads to poor outcomes and low survival rates, reinforcing the data underlying the original poor prognosis.   The same circularity can manifest itself with regard to social conditions. In 2018, the University of Texas released a report of the disparity between infant mortality rates from zip code to zip code.18 \\t\\t15 P. Watkins, J. Dagle, et al., Outcomes at 18 to 22 Months of Corrected Age for Infants Born at 22 to 25 Weeks of Gestation in a Center Practicing Active Management, 217 J. Pediatrics 52 (Feb 2020). See also Patrick J. Marmion, Decreasing disabilities by letting babies die, 33 Issues in Law and Medicine 209 (Nov 2018). 16 Barrington, supra n. 11. 17 Marmion, supra, n. 12. 18 E. Nehme, et al., Infant mortality in communities across Texas, The University of Texas (2012). \\n \\t13 \\n Though Texas had an infant mortality rate lower than the national average, troubling findings were uncovered when some zip codes were shown to have disparities as high as 12 times the rates of neighboring zip codes.19 While all races had areas of high infant mortality, Black mothers had the highest rates of infant mortality overall.20 Even when a mother lives in a locale flooded with medical resources, a child's chance of survival can decrease if none of the local hospitals have enough experience in saving the lives of extremely premature babies. While generally speaking, the availability of a NICU in a geographical area increases chances of survival, when NICUs become more commonplace, each unit may see fewer individual cases of periviable births each year and, thus, have less experience in successfully treating these babies.21 This can then perpetuate the myth that active treatment is \\\"futile,\\\" which may indurate a physician's incorrect assumption that a child of a certain age or weight is simply non-viable.   In sum, this Court's assumption in Roe, Colautti, and Casey that there is a \\\"point\\\" in pregnancy when viability \\\"occurs\\\" is mistaken. Viability is a prediction, not a point. Even if there were such a point, it would be impossible for most doctors, especially abortion providers who rarely \\t\\t19 Id. at 7. 20 Id. at 12. 21  R. Patel, M. Rysavy, et al., Survival of Infants Born at Periviable Gestational Ages, 44 Clinics in Perinatology 287 (June 2017). \\n \\t14 \\n provide care for even uncomplicated pregnancies, to determine where it is. Viability depends on myriad factors that vary and fluctuate both before and after birth, from the physical to the philosophical, from the personal to the institutional to the systemic.  III. ATTACHING CONSTITUTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE TO VIABILITY IS ILLOGICAL.   Why is any of this relevant to the case at issue? Mississippi's Gestational Age Act bans almost all abortions after 15 weeks' gestation. Petitioners have never suggested that an unborn child at 15 weeks' gestation is capable of sustained survival outside the womb under any circumstances, so why does uncertainty about the \\\"point\\\" of viability matter? It matters because this Court has built a constitutional framework on an illogical and imaginary premise, undeserving of the benefit of stare decisis.  As noted above, this Court's explanation in Roe of the significance of the non-existent \\\"point\\\" of viability consisted simply of restating the definition of viability. Colautti, in turn, took the significance of viability as a given, with no further attempt at explaining the logic behind it. Rather, Colautti emphasized that, because the point of viability (i.e., \\\"a reasonable probability of the fetus' sustained survival outside the womb\\\") is specific to each pregnancy and can be determined only by the attending physician, \\\"neither the legislature nor \\n \\t15 \\n the courts may proclaim one of the elements entering  into the ascertainment of viability -- be it weeks of gestation or fetal weight or any other single factor -- as the determinant of when the State has a compelling interest in the life or health of the fetus.\\\" Colautti, 439 U.S. at 388-389 (emphasis added). This Court has never revoked or modified Colautti's holding that an abortion ban based on gestational age is impermissible, and that determination of viability must be left to the judgment of the \\\"responsible attending\\\" abortion provider. As the years rolled by, dissenting justices continued to point out the illogic of attaching constitutional significance to viability, e.g.,    The governmental interest at issue is in protecting those who will be citizens if their lives are not ended in the womb. The substantiality of this interest is in no way dependent on the probability that the fetus may be capable of surviving outside the womb at any given point in its development, as the possibility of fetal survival is contingent on the state of medical practice and technology, factors that are in essence morally and constitutionally irrelevant. The State's interest is in the fetus as an entity in itself, and the character of this entity does not change at the point of viability under conventional medical wisdom. Accordingly, the State's interest, if compelling after viability, is equally compelling before viability. \\n \\t16 \\n  Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747, 795 (1986) (White, J., dissenting). See also, City of Akron v. Akron Ctr. for Reprod. Health, 462 U.S. 416, 461 (1983) (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (\\\"The choice of viability as the point at which the state interest in potential life becomes compelling is no less arbitrary than choosing any point before viability or any point afterward.\\\")   However, the plurality in Casey, relying on stare decisis, reaffirmed the Court's commitment to the constitutional significance of viability, even while acknowledging that its original judgment might have been unsound:  [V]iability marks the earliest point at which the State's interest in fetal life is constitutionally adequate to justify a legislative ban on nontherapeutic abortions. The soundness or unsoundness of that constitutional judgment in no sense turns on whether viability occurs at approximately 28 weeks, as was usual at the time of Roe, at 23 to 24 weeks, as it sometimes does today, or at some moment even slightly earlier in pregnancy, as it may if fetal respiratory capacity can somehow be enhanced in the future.  Casey, 505 U.S. at 860 (emphasis added). In affirming \\\"Roe's central holding,\\\" the Casey plurality also restated Roe's utterly false premise \\n \\t17 \\n that viability \\\"occurs\\\" at a \\\"point\\\" or \\\"moment\\\" in pregnancy. The Casey plurality made a self-conscious attempt to explain the reasoning behind the viability standard:  The second reason is that the concept of viability, as we noted in Roe, is the time at which there is a realistic possibility of maintaining and nourishing a life outside the womb, so that the independent existence of the second life can in reason and all fairness be the object of state protection that now overrides the rights of the woman.22   Casey, 505 U.S. at 870.  However, as Justice Scalia pointed out,  [t]he arbitrariness of the viability line is confirmed by the Court's inability to offer any justification for it beyond the conclusory \\t\\t22 This Court also half-heartedly offered a third justification for drawing a line a viability: \\\"The viability line also has, as a practical matter, an element of fairness. In some broad sense it might be said that a woman who fails to act before viability has consented to the State's intervention on behalf of the developing child.\\\" Casey, 505 U.S. at 870. However, given government data showing that over 90% of abortions are performed in the first trimester and over 98% by 20 weeks of pregnancy (CDC, Abortion Surveillance \\u2013 Findings and Reports (2016), available at https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/data_stats/abortion.htm), laches could be said, as a matter of fairness, to come into play well before viability.  \\n \\t18 \\n assertion that it is only at that point that the unborn child's life \\\"can in reason and all fairness\\\" be thought to override the interests of the mother. . . .  Precisely why is it that, at the magical second when machines currently in use (though not necessarily available to the particular woman) are able to keep an unborn child alive apart from its mother, the creature is suddenly able (under our Constitution) to be protected by law, whereas before that magical second it was not? That makes no more sense than according infants legal protection only after the point when they can feed themselves.  Id. at 989, fn. 5 (Scalia, J., concurring and dissenting).23  With a touch of unconscious irony, the Casey plurality distinguished the freedom of legislatures to \\\"draw lines which appear arbitrary without the necessity of offering a justification\\\" from its own duty to justify its line-drawing. Id. at 870. But no legal scholar has found this Court's justification persuasive, much less compelling.24 This Court's \\t\\t23 A closer analogy than Justice Scalia's might be found in the concept of \\\"pool safe,\\\" defined as the stage of development at which a child has a reasonable chance of survival if he or she accidentally falls into a swimming pool. Analogizing to viability, the state may act to protect the life of a pool-safe child, but may not act to protect a child who is not pool safe from being held face down in a bucket of water until dead.  24 See, e.g., Paul Benjamin Linton and Maura K. Quinlan, Does Stare Decisis Preclude Reconsideration of Roe v. Wade? A Critique of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 70 Case W. Res. L. \\n \\t19 \\n fictitious \\\"point of viability\\\" line has less justification than Mississippi's line of 15 weeks, based as the latter is on the science of fetal development, preservation of maternal health, and protection of medical ethics. Compare Pet. Cert. at 15-20 (examining viability standard) with id. at 20-26 (justification for 15-week abortion limit).   The Casey plurality also noted that \\\"there is no line other than viability which is more workable.\\\" Casey, 505 U.S. at 370. But, as demonstrated above, viability is not a line, or a point, or a moment, and for that reason, it is less \\\"workable,\\\" and certainly gives less notice, than a limit on abortion stated in weeks of gestational age justified by factors such as anatomical development, the capability of feeling pain, or the presence of a heartbeat. Viability as determined by the abortion provider is \\\"workable\\\" only in the sense that it is unenforceable, and thus does not give rise to difficult cases. It \\\"works\\\" for the abortion industry, but not for the state trying to protect unborn children.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_args\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sections_alt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 55,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/18-1165.html\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Section 1806(c) and (d) require the federal or a state government to \\nprovide notice to an aggrieved person whenever it in-\\ntends to introduce such info rmation as evidence in any \\nproceedings against that person. Section 1806(e) af-\\nfords the aggrieved person the opportunity to move to \\nsuppress any such information that was not obtained in compliance with FISA. And Section 1806(f) estab-\\nlishes special in camera  and ex parte  procedures to \\ndetermine the admissibility of such evidence, if the At-torney General attests that a typical adversarial hear-\\ning would harm the national security of the United \\nStates. The question presented is as follows: \\n Whether Section 1806(f ) displaces th e state-secrets \\nprivilege and authorizes a district court to resolve, in \\ncamera  and ex parte , the merits of a lawsuit challeng-\\ning the lawfulness of government surveillance by con-\\nsidering the privileged evidence. \\n \\n \\nii \\n \\nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING BELOW  \\n \\n  Petitioners are the United States of America, the \\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); Christopher A.

Six Un-\\nknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics , \\n403 U.S. 388 (1971) ( Bivens ). The Respondent Agents \\nare confident that they would defeat these claims, if \\nonly they had the same op portunity to defend them-\\nselves that is afforded to other federal officers accused \\nof violating the Constitution. However, the Ninth Cir-\\ncuit Court of Appeals\\u2019 decision below denies the Re-spondent Agents that opportunity.  \\n The decision below arises out of the Government\\u2019s \\nassertion in the district court that the identity of \\nthe individuals under invest igation in Operation Flex \\nand the reasons for investigating those individuals are state secrets. As the district court found, that assertion \\nshould spell the end of the case \\u2013 since the court cannot \\nhear evidence as to who the FBI investigated or why, it cannot adjudicate whether the government targeted \\nPlaintiffs based on their religion, and therefore Plain-\\ntiffs\\u2019 Bivens claims must be dismissed.  \\n2 \\n  Yet, the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that Sec-\\ntion 1806(f) of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \\nAct of 1978 (FISA), 50 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1801, et seq. , displaces \\nthe state secrets privilege. As a result, the court of ap-peals held, the district court cannot dismiss the case. \\nInstead, the decision below interpreted Section 1806(f )  \\nas requiring the district court to hear the state secrets evidence in camera and ex parte , and on that basis, de-\\ntermine whether the Respondent Agents violated the \\nConstitution.  \\n The government\\u2019s Petition For A Writ Of Certiorari \\ncapably explains why the Ninth Circuit\\u2019s erroneous in-terpretation of Section 1806(f )  requires immediate re-\\nview by this Court, and the Respondent Agents join in \\nthat Petition in full. But the decision below suffers \\nfrom an additional constitutional infirmity not ad-\\ndressed by the government: by requiring the district \\ncourt to determine the Respondent Agents\\u2019 Bivens  lia-\\nbility in a secret trial, on secret evidence, the Ninth \\nCircuit has deprived the Respondent Agents of their \\nSeventh Amendment right to a trial by jury. This incip-ient violation of the Respondent Agents\\u2019 constitutional \\nrights provides a further reason for immediate review \\nby this Court.  \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nSTATEMENT  \\n The Respondent Agents join in the Statement in-\\ncluded in the government\\u2019s Petition. In addition, the \\nRespondent Agents offer the following supplemental \\n3 \\n information concerning the disposition of their Sev-\\nenth Amendment argument below.  \\n The Ninth Circuit held that the Respondent \\nAgents\\u2019 \\u201cSeventh Amendment argument is prema-\\nture,\\u201d because Plaintiffs\\u2019 claims may be resolved before \\nthey could reach a jury. Pet. App. 65a. For example, the court of appeals noted, the trial court may dismiss \\nPlaintiffs\\u2019 damages  claims in light of recent decisions \\nby this Court that \\u201chave severely restricted the availa-bility of Bivens  actions for new claims and contexts\\u201d \\nlike the ones asserted here. Id., see also Pet. App. 71a \\n(citing Ziglar v. Abbasi , 137 S. Ct. 1843, 1857 (2017)). \\nAccordingly, the Ninth Circuit \\u201cdecline[d] to address \\nthe hypothetical constitutional question\\u201d raised by the \\nRespondent Agents at this time. Id.  \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \\n The Respondent Agents agree that the govern-\\nment\\u2019s Petition should be granted for the reasons \\nstated therein. Specifically, the Respondent Agents \\nagree that Section 1806(f) is unambiguous, that the Ninth Circuit\\u2019s construction thereof is implausible, \\nand that the decision below should be reversed on that \\nbasis. Moreover, to the extent the foregoing is true, the Respondent Agents concede that there is no need to \\nexamine whether the Ninth Circuit\\u2019s construction of \\nSection 1806(f) also runs afoul of the Seventh Amend-ment.  \\n \\n4 \\n A. The Ninth Circuit\\u2019s Decision Must Be Re-\\nversed Under The Cano n Of Constitutional \\nAvoidance. \\n Even if the Ninth Circuit\\u2019s opinion offers a plausi-\\nble interpretation of an ambi guous statute, however, \\nimmediate review in this Court is warranted, because \\nthe canon of constitutional avoidance requires reversal \\nof the decision below.  \\n 1.  The canon of constitutional avoidance \\u201cpro-\\nvides that when a serious doubt is raised about the constitutionality of an act of Congress, this Court will \\nfirst ascertain whether a cons truction of the statute is \\nfairly possible by which the question may be avoided.\\u201d Nielsen v. Preap , 139 S. Ct. 954, 971 (2019) (alterations \\nomitted). If such a construction is permissible, then it \\nshould be adopted. See Crowell v. Benson , 285 U.S. 22, \\n62 (1932). The canon applies in a wide range of con-\\ntexts, including as relevant here, where a proffered \\nconstruction of a federal statute runs afoul of the Sev-enth Amendment. See City of Monterey v. Del Monte \\nDunes at Monterey, Ltd. , 526 U.S. 687, 707 (1999) (be-\\nfore \\u201cinquiring into the applicability of the Seventh Amendment, we must first ascertain whether a con-\\nstruction of the statute is fairly possible by which the \\nconstitutional question may be avoided\\u201d).  \\n 2.  The Seventh Amendment to the United States \\nConstitution provides in relevant part that in \\u201cSuits at common law, where the value in controversy shall ex-\\nceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be \\npreserved.\\u201d U.S. Const. amend. VII. This Court has \\n5 \\n \\u201cconsistently interpreted the phrase \\u2018Suits at common \\nlaw\\u2019 to refer to \\u2018suits in which legal rights were to be \\nascertained and determined, in contradistinction to \\nthose where equitable rights  alone were recognized, \\nand equitable remedies were administered.\\u2019 \\u201d Granfi-\\nnanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg , 492 U.S. 33, 41 (1989) ( quot-\\ning Parsons v. Bedford , 3 Pet. 433, 447, 7 L.Ed. 732 \\n(1830)). Put another way, the Seventh Amendment em-\\nbraces \\u201c \\u2018all suits which are not of equity and admiralty \\njurisdiction, whatever might be the peculiar form which they may assume to settle legal rights.\\u2019 \\u201d Curtis \\nv. Loether , 415 U.S. 189, 193 (1974) ( quoting Parsons , 3 \\nPet. at 446-447).   \\n 3. Whether \\u201cthe government had denied a consti-\\ntutional right in acting outside the bounds of its au-thority, and, if so, the extent of any resulting damages\\u201d \\nare quintessential \\u201cquestions for the jury\\u201d under the \\nSeventh Amendment. City of Monterey , 526 U.S. at 722. \\nIt is thus unsurprising that  this Court has held that \\nBivens claims should be heard by a jury. See Carlson v. \\nGreen , 446 U.S. 14, 22 (1980) (noting that a party can \\nopt for a jury in a Bivens suit, unlike an action under \\nthe Federal Tort Claims Act). The circuit courts \\u2013 in-\\ncluding the Ninth Circuit \\u2013 are in agreement. See, e.g. , \\nNurse v. United States , 226 F.3d 996, 1005 (9th Cir. \\n2000) (following Carlson and noting that jury trials are \\n\\u201cavailable in claims against individual defendants un-der Bivens \\u201d).  \\n 4.  Presumably in reliance on these authorities, \\nPlaintiffs demanded a jury trial in their complaint. \\n(See, e.g. , Case 8:11-cv-00301, Docket no. 1 at 1.) \\n6 \\n Plaintiffs also conceded  on appeal that their Bivens \\nclaims must ordinarily be decided by a jury. (Case 12-\\n56874, Dkt. 79-2 at 21 (\\u201cAs a threshold matter, the Sev-\\nenth Amendment protects plaintiffs\\u2019 right to jury trial as well\\u201d).) In other words, it is undisputed among the \\nparties that, but for the decision below, the Respondent \\nAgents have a right to a jury trial of Plaintiffs\\u2019 Bivens \\nclaims.  \\n 5.  In light of the foregoing, the Ninth Circuit\\u2019s \\nconstruction of Section 1806(f )  raises serious doubt as \\nto its constitutionality under the Seventh Amendment. \\nThat construction requires the district court to adjudi-cate the merits of Plaintiffs\\u2019 Bivens claims in an ex \\nparte  and in camera  proceeding instead of in a trial be-\\nfore a jury. Absent a waiver, the Seventh Amendment simply does not permit a district court judge, rather \\nthan a jury, to determine the merits of a Bivens claim \\nasserted against a federal officer. By placing sole re-sponsibility for determining liability \\u2013 and presumably \\ndamages \\u2013 in the hands of the district court judge, the \\ndecision below deprives the Respondent Agents of their right to a jury trial.  \\n 6.  In light of these serious doubts, this Court \\nshould adopt the far more plausible interpretation of \\nthe statute advanced by the government in its Petition: \\nthat Section 1806(f )  may create a procedure for \\u201cre-solving questions of admissib ility or suppression\\u201d of \\nFISA-related evidence in certain circumstances, but \\nthat section does not create \\u201ca freestanding in camera  \\nand ex parte  mechanism for resolving the merits of a \\ncase brought against the government or its officers.\\u201d \\n7 \\n Pet. at 15. This construction comports with FISA\\u2019s stat-\\nutory text and pays proper deference to the Executive\\u2019s \\nresponsibility to safeguard the national security, while \\nalso avoiding an irreconcilable clash with the Respond-ent Agents\\u2019 Seventh Amendment rights. \\n \\nB. If The Canon Of Constitutional Avoidance \\nDoes Not Apply, The Decision Below Should \\nBe Reversed And The Ninth Circuit Required \\nTo Address The Respondent Agents\\u2019 Seventh Amendment Rights.  \\n As noted above, the canon of constitutional avoid-\\nance \\u201chas no application absent ambiguity\\u201d in the \\nsubject statute. Nielsen , 139 S. Ct. at 972 (quotations \\nomitted). In other words, the canon cannot be used to \\noverturn the Ninth Circuit\\u2019s interpretation of Section \\n1806(f), if the statutory te xt unambiguously supports \\nthat interpretation. Id. \\n However, even if this Court were to adopt the \\nNinth Circuit\\u2019s construction of the statute, the case \\nshould still be remanded to the Ninth Circuit for that \\ncourt to consider \\u2013 at this stage in the proceedings, not \\nat a later stage \\u2013 whether the statute must yield to the \\nSeventh Amendment. See Nielsen , 139 S. Ct. at 972 \\n(noting that where constitutional avoidance does not apply, a statute may still fall if a \\u201chead-on\\u201d challenge \\nestablishes that it violates the Constitution); see also \\nCity of Monterey , 526 U.S. at 707-22 (finding that civil \\nrights claims under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983 require a jury un-\\nder the Seventh Amendment, even though the statute \\n8 \\n itself cannot be plausibly interpreted as including such \\na requirement).  \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nCONCLUSION \\n For all of the foregoing reasons, this Court\\u2019s review \\nis warranted, and the government\\u2019s Petition For A Writ \\nOf Certiorari should be granted. \\nRespectfully submitted. \\nALEXANDER  H.

Section 1806(c) and (d) require the federal or a state government to \\nprovide notice to an aggrieved person whenever it in-\\ntends to introduce such info rmation as evidence in any \\nproceedings against that person. Section 1806(e) af-\\nfords the aggrieved person the opportunity to move to \\nsuppress any such information that was not obtained in compliance with FISA. And Section 1806(f) estab-\\nlishes special in camera  and ex parte  procedures to \\ndetermine the admissibility of such evidence, if the At-torney General attests that a typical adversarial hear-\\ning would harm the national security of the United \\nStates. The question presented is as follows: \\n Whether Section 1806(f ) displaces th e state-secrets \\nprivilege and authorizes a district court to resolve, in \\ncamera  and ex parte , the merits of a lawsuit challeng-\\ning the lawfulness of government surveillance by con-\\nsidering the privileged evidence. \\n \\n \\nii \\n \\nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING BELOW  \\n \\n  Petitioners are the United States of America, the \\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); Christopher A. Wray, in his official capacity as the Director of the FBI; \\nand Kristi K.

Asserting that the \\ninvestigation violated the First and Fifth Amendments (among other laws), Plaint iffs seek monetary damages \\nfrom the Respondent Agents under Bivens v. Six Un-\\nknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics , \\n403 U.S. 388 (1971) ( Bivens ). The Respondent Agents \\nare confident that they would defeat these claims, if \\nonly they had the same op portunity to defend them-\\nselves that is afforded to other federal officers accused \\nof violating the Constitution. However, the Ninth Cir-\\ncuit Court of Appeals' decision below denies the Re-spondent Agents that opportunity.  \\n The decision below arises out of the Government's \\nassertion in the district court that the identity of \\nthe individuals under invest igation in Operation Flex \\nand the reasons for investigating those individuals are state secrets. As the district court found, that assertion \\nshould spell the end of the case \\u2013 since the court cannot \\nhear evidence as to who the FBI investigated or why, it cannot adjudicate whether the government targeted \\nPlaintiffs based on their religion, and therefore Plain-\\ntiffs' Bivens claims must be dismissed.  \\n2 \\n  Yet, the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that Sec-\\ntion 1806(f) of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \\nAct of 1978 (FISA), 50 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1801, et seq. , displaces \\nthe state secrets privilege. As a result, the court of ap-peals held, the district court cannot dismiss the case. \\nInstead, the decision below interpreted Section 1806(f )  \\nas requiring the district court to hear the state secrets evidence in camera and ex parte , and on that basis, de-\\ntermine whether the Respondent Agents violated the \\nConstitution.  \\n The government's Petition For A Writ Of Certiorari \\ncapably explains why the Ninth Circuit's erroneous in-terpretation of Section 1806(f )  requires immediate re-\\nview by this Court, and the Respondent Agents join in \\nthat Petition in full. But the decision below suffers \\nfrom an additional constitutional infirmity not ad-\\ndressed by the government: by requiring the district \\ncourt to determine the Respondent Agents' Bivens  lia-\\nbility in a secret trial, on secret evidence, the Ninth \\nCircuit has deprived the Respondent Agents of their \\nSeventh Amendment right to a trial by jury. This incip-ient violation of the Respondent Agents' constitutional \\nrights provides a further reason for immediate review \\nby this Court.  \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nSTATEMENT  \\n The Respondent Agents join in the Statement in-\\ncluded in the government's Petition. In addition, the \\nRespondent Agents offer the following supplemental \\n3 \\n information concerning the disposition of their Sev-\\nenth Amendment argument below.  \\n The Ninth Circuit held that the Respondent \\nAgents' \\\"Seventh Amendment argument is prema-\\nture,\\\" because Plaintiffs' claims may be resolved before \\nthey could reach a jury. Pet. App. 65a. For example, the court of appeals noted, the trial court may dismiss \\nPlaintiffs' damages  claims in light of recent decisions \\nby this Court that \\\"have severely restricted the availa-bility of Bivens  actions for new claims and contexts\\\" \\nlike the ones asserted here. Id., see also Pet. App. 71a \\n(citing Ziglar v. Abbasi , 137 S. Ct. 1843, 1857 (2017)). \\nAccordingly, the Ninth Circuit \\\"decline[d] to address \\nthe hypothetical constitutional question\\\" raised by the \\nRespondent Agents at this time. Id.  \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \\n The Respondent Agents agree that the govern-\\nment's Petition should be granted for the reasons \\nstated therein. Specifically, the Respondent Agents \\nagree that Section 1806(f) is unambiguous, that the Ninth Circuit's construction thereof is implausible, \\nand that the decision below should be reversed on that \\nbasis. Moreover, to the extent the foregoing is true, the Respondent Agents concede that there is no need to \\nexamine whether the Ninth Circuit's construction of \\nSection 1806(f) also runs afoul of the Seventh Amend-ment.  \\n \\n4 \\n A. The Ninth Circuit's Decision Must Be Re-\\nversed Under The Cano n Of Constitutional \\nAvoidance. \\n Even if the Ninth Circuit's opinion offers a plausi-\\nble interpretation of an ambi guous statute, however, \\nimmediate review in this Court is warranted, because \\nthe canon of constitutional avoidance requires reversal \\nof the decision below.  \\n 1.  The canon of constitutional avoidance \\\"pro-\\nvides that when a serious doubt is raised about the constitutionality of an act of Congress, this Court will \\nfirst ascertain whether a cons truction of the statute is \\nfairly possible by which the question may be avoided.\\\" Nielsen v. Preap , 139 S. Ct. 954, 971 (2019) (alterations \\nomitted). If such a construction is permissible, then it \\nshould be adopted. See Crowell v. Benson , 285 U.S. 22, \\n62 (1932). The canon applies in a wide range of con-\\ntexts, including as relevant here, where a proffered \\nconstruction of a federal statute runs afoul of the Sev-enth Amendment. See City of Monterey v. Del Monte \\nDunes at Monterey, Ltd. , 526 U.S. 687, 707 (1999) (be-\\nfore \\\"inquiring into the applicability of the Seventh Amendment, we must first ascertain whether a con-\\nstruction of the statute is fairly possible by which the \\nconstitutional question may be avoided\\\").  \\n 2.  The Seventh Amendment to the United States \\nConstitution provides in relevant part that in \\\"Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall ex-\\nceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be \\npreserved.\\\" U.S. Const. amend. VII. This Court has \\n5 \\n \\\"consistently interpreted the phrase 'Suits at common \\nlaw' to refer to 'suits in which legal rights were to be \\nascertained and determined, in contradistinction to \\nthose where equitable rights  alone were recognized, \\nand equitable remedies were administered.' \\\" Granfi-\\nnanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg , 492 U.S. 33, 41 (1989) ( quot-\\ning Parsons v. Bedford , 3 Pet. 433, 447, 7 L.Ed. 732 \\n(1830)). Put another way, the Seventh Amendment em-\\nbraces \\\" 'all suits which are not of equity and admiralty \\njurisdiction, whatever might be the peculiar form which they may assume to settle legal rights.' \\\" Curtis \\nv. Loether , 415 U.S. 189, 193 (1974) ( quoting Parsons , 3 \\nPet. at 446-447).   \\n 3. Whether \\\"the government had denied a consti-\\ntutional right in acting outside the bounds of its au-thority, and, if so, the extent of any resulting damages\\\" \\nare quintessential \\\"questions for the jury\\\" under the \\nSeventh Amendment. City of Monterey , 526 U.S. at 722. \\nIt is thus unsurprising that  this Court has held that \\nBivens claims should be heard by a jury. See Carlson v. \\nGreen , 446 U.S. 14, 22 (1980) (noting that a party can \\nopt for a jury in a Bivens suit, unlike an action under \\nthe Federal Tort Claims Act). The circuit courts \\u2013 in-\\ncluding the Ninth Circuit \\u2013 are in agreement. See, e.g. , \\nNurse v. United States , 226 F.3d 996, 1005 (9th Cir. \\n2000) (following Carlson and noting that jury trials are \\n\\\"available in claims against individual defendants un-der Bivens \\\").  \\n 4.  Presumably in reliance on these authorities, \\nPlaintiffs demanded a jury trial in their complaint. \\n(See, e.g. , Case 8:11-cv-00301, Docket no. 1 at 1.) \\n6 \\n Plaintiffs also conceded  on appeal that their Bivens \\nclaims must ordinarily be decided by a jury. (Case 12-\\n56874, Dkt. 79-2 at 21 (\\\"As a threshold matter, the Sev-\\nenth Amendment protects plaintiffs' right to jury trial as well\\\").) In other words, it is undisputed among the \\nparties that, but for the decision below, the Respondent \\nAgents have a right to a jury trial of Plaintiffs' Bivens \\nclaims.  \\n 5.  In light of the foregoing, the Ninth Circuit's \\nconstruction of Section 1806(f )  raises serious doubt as \\nto its constitutionality under the Seventh Amendment. \\nThat construction requires the district court to adjudi-cate the merits of Plaintiffs' Bivens claims in an ex \\nparte  and in camera  proceeding instead of in a trial be-\\nfore a jury. Absent a waiver, the Seventh Amendment simply does not permit a district court judge, rather \\nthan a jury, to determine the merits of a Bivens claim \\nasserted against a federal officer. By placing sole re-sponsibility for determining liability \\u2013 and presumably \\ndamages \\u2013 in the hands of the district court judge, the \\ndecision below deprives the Respondent Agents of their right to a jury trial.  \\n 6.  In light of these serious doubts, this Court \\nshould adopt the far more plausible interpretation of \\nthe statute advanced by the government in its Petition: \\nthat Section 1806(f )  may create a procedure for \\\"re-solving questions of admissib ility or suppression\\\" of \\nFISA-related evidence in certain circumstances, but \\nthat section does not create \\\"a freestanding in camera  \\nand ex parte  mechanism for resolving the merits of a \\ncase brought against the government or its officers.\\\" \\n7 \\n Pet. at 15. This construction comports with FISA's stat-\\nutory text and pays proper deference to the Executive's \\nresponsibility to safeguard the national security, while \\nalso avoiding an irreconcilable clash with the Respond-ent Agents' Seventh Amendment rights. \\n \\nB. If The Canon Of Constitutional Avoidance \\nDoes Not Apply, The Decision Below Should \\nBe Reversed And The Ninth Circuit Required \\nTo Address The Respondent Agents' Seventh Amendment Rights.  \\n As noted above, the canon of constitutional avoid-\\nance \\\"has no application absent ambiguity\\\" in the \\nsubject statute. Nielsen , 139 S. Ct. at 972 (quotations \\nomitted). In other words, the canon cannot be used to \\noverturn the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of Section \\n1806(f), if the statutory te xt unambiguously supports \\nthat interpretation. Id. \\n However, even if this Court were to adopt the \\nNinth Circuit's construction of the statute, the case \\nshould still be remanded to the Ninth Circuit for that \\ncourt to consider \\u2013 at this stage in the proceedings, not \\nat a later stage \\u2013 whether the statute must yield to the \\nSeventh Amendment. See Nielsen , 139 S. Ct. at 972 \\n(noting that where constitutional avoidance does not apply, a statute may still fall if a \\\"head-on\\\" challenge \\nestablishes that it violates the Constitution); see also \\nCity of Monterey , 526 U.S. at 707-22 (finding that civil \\nrights claims under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983 require a jury un-\\nder the Seventh Amendment, even though the statute \\n8 \\n itself cannot be plausibly interpreted as including such \\na requirement).  \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_content_alt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \".....................................................  8 \\n \\niv \\n \\nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \\nPage \\n CASES \\nBivens v.

The canon applies in a wide range of con-\\ntexts, including as relevant here, where a proffered \\nconstruction of a federal statute runs afoul of the Sev-enth Amendment. See City of Monterey v. Del Monte \\nDunes at Monterey, Ltd. , 526 U.S. 687, 707 (1999) (be-\\nfore \\\"inquiring into the applicability of the Seventh Amendment, we must first ascertain whether a con-\\nstruction of the statute is fairly possible by which the \\nconstitutional question may be avoided\\\").  \\n 2.  The Seventh Amendment to the United States \\nConstitution provides in relevant part that in \\\"Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall ex-\\nceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be \\npreserved.\\\" U.S. Const. amend. VII. This Court has \\n5 \\n \\\"consistently interpreted the phrase 'Suits at common \\nlaw' to refer to 'suits in which legal rights were to be \\nascertained and determined, in contradistinction to \\nthose where equitable rights  alone were recognized, \\nand equitable remedies were administered.' \\\" Granfi-\\nnanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg , 492 U.S. 33, 41 (1989) ( quot-\\ning Parsons v. Bedford , 3 Pet. 433, 447, 7 L.Ed. 732 \\n(1830)). Put another way, the Seventh Amendment em-\\nbraces \\\" 'all suits which are not of equity and admiralty \\njurisdiction, whatever might be the peculiar form which they may assume to settle legal rights.' \\\" Curtis \\nv. Loether , 415 U.S. 189, 193 (1974) ( quoting Parsons , 3 \\nPet. at 446-447).   \\n 3. Whether \\\"the government had denied a consti-\\ntutional right in acting outside the bounds of its au-thority, and, if so, the extent of any resulting damages\\\" \\nare quintessential \\\"questions for the jury\\\" under the \\nSeventh Amendment. City of Monterey , 526 U.S. at 722. \\nIt is thus unsurprising that  this Court has held that \\nBivens claims should be heard by a jury. See Carlson v. \\nGreen , 446 U.S. 14, 22 (1980) (noting that a party can \\nopt for a jury in a Bivens suit, unlike an action under \\nthe Federal Tort Claims Act). The circuit courts \\u2013 in-\\ncluding the Ninth Circuit \\u2013 are in agreement. See, e.g. , \\nNurse v. United States , 226 F.3d 996, 1005 (9th Cir. \\n2000) (following Carlson and noting that jury trials are \\n\\\"available in claims against individual defendants un-der Bivens \\\").  \\n 4.  Presumably in reliance on these authorities, \\nPlaintiffs demanded a jury trial in their complaint. \\n(See, e.g. , Case 8:11-cv-00301, Docket no. 1 at 1.) \\n6 \\n Plaintiffs also conceded  on appeal that their Bivens \\nclaims must ordinarily be decided by a jury. (Case 12-\\n56874, Dkt. 79-2 at 21 (\\\"As a threshold matter, the Sev-\\nenth Amendment protects plaintiffs' right to jury trial as well\\\").) In other words, it is undisputed among the \\nparties that, but for the decision below, the Respondent \\nAgents have a right to a jury trial of Plaintiffs' Bivens \\nclaims.  \\n 5.  In light of the foregoing, the Ninth Circuit's \\nconstruction of Section 1806(f )  raises serious doubt as \\nto its constitutionality under the Seventh Amendment. \\nThat construction requires the district court to adjudi-cate the merits of Plaintiffs' Bivens claims in an ex \\nparte  and in camera  proceeding instead of in a trial be-\\nfore a jury. Absent a waiver, the Seventh Amendment simply does not permit a district court judge, rather \\nthan a jury, to determine the merits of a Bivens claim \\nasserted against a federal officer. By placing sole re-sponsibility for determining liability \\u2013 and presumably \\ndamages \\u2013 in the hands of the district court judge, the \\ndecision below deprives the Respondent Agents of their right to a jury trial.  \\n 6.  In light of these serious doubts, this Court \\nshould adopt the far more plausible interpretation of \\nthe statute advanced by the government in its Petition: \\nthat Section 1806(f )  may create a procedure for \\\"re-solving questions of admissib ility or suppression\\\" of \\nFISA-related evidence in certain circumstances, but \\nthat section does not create \\\"a freestanding in camera  \\nand ex parte  mechanism for resolving the merits of a \\ncase brought against the government or its officers.\\\" \\n7 \\n Pet. at 15. This construction comports with FISA's stat-\\nutory text and pays proper deference to the Executive's \\nresponsibility to safeguard the national security, while \\nalso avoiding an irreconcilable clash with the Respond-ent Agents' Seventh Amendment rights. \\n \\nB. If The Canon Of Constitutional Avoidance \\nDoes Not Apply, The Decision Below Should \\nBe Reversed And The Ninth Circuit Required \\nTo Address The Respondent Agents' Seventh Amendment Rights.  \\n As noted above, the canon of constitutional avoid-\\nance \\\"has no application absent ambiguity\\\" in the \\nsubject statute. Nielsen , 139 S. Ct. at 972 (quotations \\nomitted). In other words, the canon cannot be used to \\noverturn the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of Section \\n1806(f), if the statutory te xt unambiguously supports \\nthat interpretation. Id. \\n However, even if this Court were to adopt the \\nNinth Circuit's construction of the statute, the case \\nshould still be remanded to the Ninth Circuit for that \\ncourt to consider \\u2013 at this stage in the proceedings, not \\nat a later stage \\u2013 whether the statute must yield to the \\nSeventh Amendment. See Nielsen , 139 S. Ct. at 972 \\n(noting that where constitutional avoidance does not apply, a statute may still fall if a \\\"head-on\\\" challenge \\nestablishes that it violates the Constitution); see also \\nCity of Monterey , 526 U.S. at 707-22 (finding that civil \\nrights claims under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983 require a jury un-\\nder the Seventh Amendment, even though the statute \\n8 \\n itself cannot be plausibly interpreted as including such \\na requirement).  \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_args\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sections_alt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/20-828.html\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

      "of the decision below.  \n",
      " 1.  The canon of constitutional avoidance \"pro-\n",
      "vides that when a serious doubt is raised about the constitutionality of an act of Congress, this Court will \n",
      "first ascertain whether a cons truction of the statute is \n",
      "fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.\" Nielsen v. Preap , 139 S. Ct. 954, 971 (2019) (alterations \n",

      "are quintessential \"questions for the jury\" under the \n",
      "Seventh Amendment. City of Monterey , 526 U.S. at 722. \n",
      "It is thus unsurprising that  this Court has held that \n",

      "cluding the Ninth Circuit – are in agreement. See, e.g. , \n",
      "Nurse v. United States , 226 F.3d 996, 1005 (9th Cir. \n",
      "2000) (following Carlson and noting that jury trials are \n",

      "56874, Dkt. 79-2 at 21 (\"As a threshold matter, the Sev-\n",

      "parties that, but for the decision below, the Respondent \n",
      "Agents have a right to a jury trial of Plaintiffs' Bivens \n",
      "claims.  \n",
      " 5.  In light of the foregoing, the Ninth Circuit's \n",
      "construction of Section 1806(f )  raises serious doubt as \n",
      "to its constitutionality under the Seventh Amendment. \n",
      "That construction requires the district court to adjudi-cate the merits of Plaintiffs' Bivens claims in an ex \n",
      "parte  and in camera  proceeding instead of in a trial be-\n",
      "fore a jury. Absent a waiver, the Seventh Amendment simply does not permit a district court judge, rather \n",
      "than a jury, to determine the merits of a Bivens claim \n",
      "asserted against a federal officer. By placing sole re-sponsibility for determining liability – and presumably \n",
      "damages – in the hands of the district court judge, the \n",
      "decision below deprives the Respondent Agents of their right to a jury trial.  \n",
      " 6.  In light of these serious doubts, this Court \n",
      "should adopt the far more plausible interpretation of \n",
      "the statute advanced by the government in its Petition: \n",
      "that Section 1806(f )  may create a procedure for \"re-solving questions of admissib ility or suppression\" of \n",
      "FISA-related evidence in certain circumstances, but \n",
      "that section does not create \"a freestanding in camera  \n",
      "and ex parte  mechanism for resolving the merits of a \n",
      "case brought against the government or its officers.\" \n",
      "7 \n",

      "also avoiding an irreconcilable clash with the Respond-ent Agents' Seventh Amendment rights. \n",
      " \n",
      "B. If The Canon Of Constitutional Avoidance \n",
      "Does Not Apply, The Decision Below Should \n",

      "subject statute. Nielsen , 139 S. Ct. at 972 (quotations \n",

      "{\"A. The Ninth Circuit's Decision Must Be Reversed Under The Canon Of Constitutional Avoidance  \": '. \\n Even if the Ninth Circuit\\'s opinion offers a plausi-\\nble interpretation of an ambi guous statute, however, \\nimmediate review in this Court is warranted, because \\nthe canon of constitutional avoidance requires reversal \\nof the decision below.  \\n 1.  The canon of constitutional avoidance \"pro-\\nvides that when a serious doubt is raised about the constitutionality of an act of Congress, this Court will \\nfirst ascertain whether a cons truction of the statute is \\nfairly possible by which the question may be avoided.\" Nielsen v. Preap , 139 S. Ct. 954, 971 (2019) (alterations \\nomitted). If such a construction is permissible, then it \\nshould be adopted. See Crowell v. Benson , 285 U.S. 22, \\n62 (1932). The canon applies in a wide range of con-\\ntexts, including as relevant here, where a proffered \\nconstruction of a federal statute runs afoul of the Sev-enth Amendment. See City of Monterey v. Del Monte \\nDunes at Monterey, Ltd. , 526 U.S. 687, 707 (1999) (be-\\nfore \"inquiring into the applicability of the Seventh Amendment, we must first ascertain whether a con-\\nstruction of the statute is fairly possible by which the \\nconstitutional question may be avoided\").  \\n 2.  The Seventh Amendment to the United States \\nConstitution provides in relevant part that in \"Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall ex-\\nceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be \\npreserved.\" U.S. Const. amend. VII. This Court has \\n5 \\n \"consistently interpreted the phrase \\'Suits at common \\nlaw\\' to refer to \\'suits in which legal rights were to be \\nascertained and determined, in contradistinction to \\nthose where equitable rights  alone were recognized, \\nand equitable remedies were administered.\\' \" Granfi-\\nnanciera, S.A. v. Nordberg , 492 U.S. 33, 41 (1989) ( quot-\\ning Parsons v. Bedford , 3 Pet. 433, 447, 7 L.Ed. 732 \\n(1830)). Put another way, the Seventh Amendment em-\\nbraces \" \\'all suits which are not of equity and admiralty \\njurisdiction, whatever might be the peculiar form which they may assume to settle legal rights.\\' \" Curtis \\nv. Loether , 415 U.S. 189, 193 (1974) ( quoting Parsons , 3 \\nPet. at 446-447).   \\n 3. Whether \"the government had denied a consti-\\ntutional right in acting outside the bounds of its au-thority, and, if so, the extent of any resulting damages\" \\nare quintessential \"questions for the jury\" under the \\nSeventh Amendment. City of Monterey , 526 U.S. at 722. \\nIt is thus unsurprising that  this Court has held that \\nBivens claims should be heard by a jury. See Carlson v. \\nGreen , 446 U.S. 14, 22 (1980) (noting that a party can \\nopt for a jury in a Bivens suit, unlike an action under \\nthe Federal Tort Claims Act). The circuit courts – in-\\ncluding the Ninth Circuit – are in agreement. See, e.g. , \\nNurse v. United States , 226 F.3d 996, 1005 (9th Cir. \\n2000) (following Carlson and noting that jury trials are \\n\"available in claims against individual defendants un-der Bivens \").  \\n 4.  Presumably in reliance on these authorities, \\nPlaintiffs demanded a jury trial in their complaint. \\n(See, e.g. , Case 8:11-cv-00301, Docket no. 1 at 1.) \\n6 \\n Plaintiffs also conceded  on appeal that their Bivens \\nclaims must ordinarily be decided by a jury. (Case 12-\\n56874, Dkt. 79-2 at 21 (\"As a threshold matter, the Sev-\\nenth Amendment protects plaintiffs\\' right to jury trial as well\").) In other words, it is undisputed among the \\nparties that, but for the decision below, the Respondent \\nAgents have a right to a jury trial of Plaintiffs\\' Bivens \\nclaims.  \\n 5.  In light of the foregoing, the Ninth Circuit\\'s \\nconstruction of Section 1806(f )  raises serious doubt as \\nto its constitutionality under the Seventh Amendment. \\nThat construction requires the district court to adjudi-cate the merits of Plaintiffs\\' Bivens claims in an ex \\nparte  and in camera  proceeding instead of in a trial be-\\nfore a jury. Absent a waiver, the Seventh Amendment simply does not permit a district court judge, rather \\nthan a jury, to determine the merits of a Bivens claim \\nasserted against a federal officer. By placing sole re-sponsibility for determining liability – and presumably \\ndamages – in the hands of the district court judge, the \\ndecision below deprives the Respondent Agents of their right to a jury trial.  \\n 6.  In light of these serious doubts, this Court \\nshould adopt the far more plausible interpretation of \\nthe statute advanced by the government in its Petition: \\nthat Section 1806(f )  may create a procedure for \"re-solving questions of admissib ility or suppression\" of \\nFISA-related evidence in certain circumstances, but \\nthat section does not create \"a freestanding in camera  \\nand ex parte  mechanism for resolving the merits of a \\ncase brought against the government or its officers.\" \\n7 \\n Pet. at 15. This construction comports with FISA\\'s stat-\\nutory text and pays proper deference to the Executive\\'s \\nresponsibility to safeguard the national security, while \\nalso avoiding an irreconcilable clash with the Respond-ent Agents\\' Seventh Amendment rights.'}\n",
      "\n",
      "{\"B. If The Canon Of Constitutional Avoidance Does Not Apply, The Decision Below Should Be Reversed And The Ninth Circuit Required To Address The Respondent Agents' Seventh Amendment Rights\": '.  \\n As noted above, the canon of constitutional avoid-\\nance \"has no application absent ambiguity\" in the \\nsubject statute. Nielsen , 139 S. Ct. at 972 (quotations \\nomitted). In other words, the canon cannot be used to \\noverturn the Ninth Circuit\\'s interpretation of Section \\n1806(f), if the statutory te xt unambiguously supports \\nthat interpretation. Id. \\n However, even if this Court were to adopt the \\nNinth Circuit\\'s construction of the statute, the case \\nshould still be remanded to the Ninth Circuit for that \\ncourt to consider – at this stage in the proceedings, not \\nat a later stage – whether the statute must yield to the \\nSeventh Amendment. See Nielsen , 139 S. Ct. at 972 \\n(noting that where constitutional avoidance does not apply, a statute may still fall if a \"head-on\" challenge \\nestablishes that it violates the Constitution); see also \\nCity of Monterey , 526 U.S. at 707-22 (finding that civil \\nrights claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 require a jury un-\\nder the Seventh Amendment, even though the statute \\n8 \\n itself cannot be plausibly interpreted as including such \\na requirement).  \\n--------------------------------- ♦ ---------------------------------'}\n"

      "{'I. THE RULE OF LENITY SHOULD BE APPLIED RIGOROUSLY TO MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCING STATUTES': '\"[T]he rule of lenity[] teach[es] that ambiguities \\nabout the breadth of a cri minal statute should be \\nresolved in the defendant\\'s favor.\"  United States v. \\nDavis , 139 S. Ct. 2319, 2333 ( 2019).  That rule has \\nfamously been described as \"\\'perhaps not much less old than\\' the task of statut ory \\'construction itself.\\'\"  \\nId. (quoting United States v. Wiltberger , 18 U.S.  \\n(5 Wheat.) 76, 95 (1820) (Marshall, C.J.)).   \\nAt its core the rule of le nity is an understanding \\nthat \"a fair warning should be given to the world in \\nlanguage that the common world will understand,  \\nof what the law intends to  do if a certain line is \\npassed,\" and that, \"[t]o make  the warning fair, so far \\nas possible the line sh ould be clear.\"  McBoyle v. \\nUnited States , 283 U.S. 25, 27 (1931) (Holmes, J.).  In \\naddition, judicial adherence to the rule of lenity also \"places the weight of inertia upon the party\" – that \\nis, the executive branch – \"that can best induce \\nCongress to speak more clearly and keeps courts \\n 7 \\nfrom making criminal law in Congress\\'s stead.\"  \\nUnited States v. Santos , 553 U.S. 507, 514 (2008) \\n(plurality); see Bell v. United States , 349 U.S. 81, 83 \\n(1955) (Frankfurter, J.) (\" When Congress leaves to \\nthe Judiciary the task of imputing to Congress an \\nundeclared will, the ambiguity should be resolved in \\nfavor of lenity.\"). \\nIn several cases involving mandatory minimum \\nsentencing provisions, the Court has recognized and \\napplied the \"presupposition . . . [that] doubts in the enforcement of a penal code\" should be \"resolve[d] . . . \\nagainst the imposition of a harsher punishment.\"  Bell, 349 U.S. at 83.  Examples include Davis , which \\ninvoked lenity to reject a broader saving construction of a different provision of the same mandatory mini-\\nmum statute at issue here, see 139 S. Ct. at 2333; \\nBurrage v. United States , 571 U.S. 204 (2014), which \\ndescribed a 15-year mandat ory minimum statute as \\n\"a criminal statute subject to the rule of lenity,\" and \\nlenity as a reason the Court \"[e]specially\" could not \\ndepart from the \"ordinary,  accepted meaning\" of  \\n\"the [statutory] text,\" id. at 216; and United States  \\nv. Granderson , 511 U.S. 39 (1994), which \"appl[ied] \\nthe rule of lenity\" to \"resolve [an] ambiguity\" in a \"mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment\" \\nafter revocation of probation, id. at 56-57.  Those \\ndecisions cohere with others explaining that the rule of lenity assists \"not only to resolve issues about the \\nsubstantive scope of criminal statutes, but to answer questions about the severity of sentencing.\"  United \\nStates v. R.L.C. , 503 U.S. 291, 306 (1992) (plurality) \\n(citing Bifulco v. United States , 447 U.S. 381, 387 \\n(1980) (collecting cases)). \\nIndeed, especially good reasons warrant applying \\nthe rule of lenity rigorously to statutes that, like the \\nACCA, create aggravated offenses with mandatory \\n 8 \\nminimum sentences.  A broad construction bars \\njudges from tailoring the sentence to the offense and \\nthe offender, leading to particularly harsh conse-\\nquences that only Congress can correct.  A narrower \\nconstruction, by contrast, does not prevent judges \\nfrom imposing longer sentences where necessary.  \\n\"These interpretive asymmetries give the rule of \\nlenity special force in the context of mandatory \\nminimum provisions.\"  Dean v. United States , 556 \\nU.S. 568, 585 (2009) (Breyer, J., dissenting). \\nFurther, experience shows that mandatory mini-\\nmum statutes frequently present difficult problems \\nof statutory construction, creating a heightened risk \\nthat courts will read them to impose sentences that \\nCongress never intended.  Wh ere, as here, an unclear \\nstatute presents a palpable risk of error, courts \\nproperly refuse to \"condemn a man to a minimum of \\n15 years in prison on the basis of . . . speculation,\" \\nBegay v. United States , 553 U.S. 137, 154 (2008) \\n(Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment), about what \\nCongress meant to say.'}\n",
      "{'A. The Rule of Lenity Helps Avoid the Particularly High Costs of Reading Mandatory Minimums Too Broadly': '1. The costs of erroneously construing mandatory \\nminimum sentencing provisions too broadly are especially high, and the costs of construing them too \\nnarrowly are especially low.  The greatest cost of \\nreading a mandatory minimu m too broadly is that \\nindividual defendants lose  their liberty.  Mandatory \\nminimum provisions are, by design, severe.  They \\noften tie an additional prison sentence of years or \\ndecades (here, a decade and a half) to a single factual \\ndetermination.  Such provisions therefore speak to \\nthe core concern that has motivated courts to apply \\nthe rule of lenity for centuries:  the \"instinctive \\n 9 \\ndistaste[] against men lang uishing in prison unless \\nthe lawmaker has clearly sa id they should.\"  Henry \\nJ. Friendly, \"Mr. Justice Frankfurter and the Reading of Statutes,\" in Benchmarks  196, 209 (1967), \\nquoted in United States v. Bass , 404 U.S. 336, 348 \\n(1971).  Because of that concern, this Court \"will not \\ninterpret a federal criminal statute so as to increase \\nthe penalty that it places on an individual when such \\nan interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what Congress intended.\"  Ladner v. \\nUnited States , 358 U.S. 169, 178 (1958). \\nFurther, mandatory minimum provisions often are \\nsaid to reflect (at least in theory) the moral judgment \\nof the community that particular conduct deserves \\nharsher punishment.  In our system of government, \\nthat judgment is reserved to the legislature.  The \\nrule of lenity ensures that criminal sentences \\nactually reflect legislative judgment, rather than \\nguesswork by the courts abo ut what the legislature \\nmeant.  See Granderson , 511 U.S. at 69 (Kennedy, J., \\nconcurring in the judgment) (\"\\'[B]ecause criminal punishment usually represents the moral condemna-\\ntion of the community, legislatures and not courts \\nshould define criminal activity,\\' and set the punish-\\nments therefor.\") (quoting Bass , 404 U.S. at 348) \\n(citation omitted); R.L.C. , 503 U.S. at 309 (Scalia, J., \\nconcurring in part and co ncurring in the judgment) \\n(describing one of \"the rule of lenity\\'s . . . purpose[s]\" \\nas \"assuring that the society, through its represen-\\ntatives, has genuinely called for the punishment to \\nbe meted out\"); Wiltberger , 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) at 95 \\n(explaining that \"[t]he rule that penal laws are to  be construed strictly\" is  founded not merely on \\n\"tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals\" \\nbut also on the \"plain principle that the power of \\n 10 \\npunishment is vested in the legislative, not in the \\njudicial department\"). \\nAny criminal statute presents these concerns,  \\nbut mandatory minimum provisions make them \\nparticularly weighty.  Unlike other criminal laws, \\nmandatory minimums are exceptions to the principle \\nthat courts should \"impose a sentence sufficient,  \\nbut not greater than necessary,\" to accomplish the goals of criminal punishme nt after considering  \\n\"the nature and circumstances of the offense and  \\nthe history and characteristics of the defendant.\"   \\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1).  A mandatory minimum is a \\ncongressional directive to subordinate justice in \\nindividual cases to a perceived need for greater \\ndeterrence or incapacitation generally.  Congress may choose to make that tradeoff (within constitu-\\ntional bounds), but the courts should ensure that \\nCongress has actually made that choice before \\nimposing needlessly harsh punishments.  Cf. Busic  \\nv. United States , 446 U.S. 398, 408-09 (1980) \\n(interpreting a sentencing enhancement; rejecting the \"assumption that . . . Congress\\' sole objective  \\nwas to increase the penalties . . . to the maximum \\nextent possible\"). \\n2. The adverse consequences of erroneously \\nexpanding mandatory sentencing beyond the limits of congressional intent affect more than just \\nindividual defendants.  Such errors strike at the \\nfoundations of the sentencing system by under-\\nmining \"sentencing proportionality – a key element of sentencing fairness.\"  Harris v. United States , 536 \\nU.S. 545, 570-71 (2002) (Breye r, J., concurring in \\npart and concurring in the judgment), overruled by \\nAlleyne v. United States , 570 U.S. 99 (2013).  As the \\nSentencing Commission – quoted with approval by this Court – has explained:  \"\\'The \"cliffs\" that result \\n 11 \\nfrom mandatory minimums compromise proportion-\\nality, a fundamental prem ise for just punishment, \\nand a primary goal of the Sentencing Reform Act.\\'\"  Neal v. United States , 516 U.S. 284, 291-92 (1996) \\n(quoting United States Sentencing Comm\\'n, Special \\nReport to the Congress:  Mandatory Minimum \\nPenalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System  iii \\n(Aug. 1991)). \\nFurther, the rule of leni ty historically has been \\njustified in part based on the \"principle of legality\":  conduct can be criminalized , and penalties author-\\nized, only by legislative action, so \"that the amount  \\nof discretion entrusted to those who enforce the law \\ndoes not exceed tolerable lim its.\"  Herbert L. Packer, \\nThe Limits of the Criminal Sanction  93 (1968).  As \\nthe Court put it in Marinello v. United States , 138 S. \\nCt. 1101 (2018), \"prosecutorial discretion\" to enforce \\na statute with \"wide-rangin g scope . . . places great \\npower in the hands of the prosecutor,\" creating risks of \"nonuniform execution\" and \"arbitary prosecution.\"  \\nId. at 1108-09.  That concern is one reason for  \\nthe Court\\'s \"\\'traditional[] exercise[]\\'\" of \"\\'restraint in \\nassessing the reach of a federal criminal statute.\\'\"  Id. at 1109 (quoting United States v. Aguilar , 515 \\nU.S. 593, 600 (1995)).  And it is a special problem \\nwith mandatory minimums that effectively transfer \\nsentencing discretion from the trial judge, \"the one \\nactor in the system most ex perienced with exercising \\ndiscretion,\" to \"an assistant prosecutor not trained in \\nthe exercise of discretion.\"   An Address by Anthony \\nM. Kennedy, Associate Justic e, Supreme Court of the \\nUnited States, Speech at the American Bar Associ-\\nation Annual Meeting (Aug. 9, 2003), available at  \\nhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/speeches/sp_08-09-03.html. \\n 12 \\nInconsistently exercised discretion means that, in \\npractice, mandatory minimums fail to yield even \\nuniformity in sentencing – the benefit they are \\nsupposed to obtain at the cost of individual justice \\nand proportionality.  Over decades, the Sentencing \\nCommission has repeatedly reported \"inconsisten[cy]\" \\nand \"wide geographic variations\" in the use of mandatory minimum sentences.  E.g., United States \\nSentencing Comm\\'n, Application and Impact of  \\n21 U.S.C. § 851:  Enhanced  Penalties for Federal \\nDrug Trafficking Offenders  6 (July 2018) (finding \\n\"significant variation in the extent to which . . . enhanced penalties were sought against eligible \\noffenders\"); see also United States v. Angelos , 345  \\nF. Supp. 2d 1227, 1252 (D. Utah 2004) (discussing \\n\"the potential for tremendous sentencing disparity if \\nfederal prosecutors across th e country do not uniformly \\ncharge . . . violations\" of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)), aff\\'d , 433 \\nF.3d 738 (10th Cir. 2006).\\n2   \\n                                                 \\n2 See also  United States Sentencing Comm\\'n, Mandatory \\nMinimum Penalties for Sex Offenses in the Federal Criminal \\nJustice System  56 (Jan. 2019) (finding that, \"[i]n fiscal year \\n2016, the mandatory minimum penalty for receipt [of child por-nography] [wa]s inconsistently applied,\" leading to \"substantial\" \\ndifferences in sentences where \"the conduct involved in the  \\noffenses was not meaningfully distinguishable\"); United States Sentencing Comm\\'n, Report to Congress:  Mandatory Minimum \\nPenalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System  345 (Oct. \\n2011) (\"2011 Report\") (finding \"inconsistencies in application  \\nof certain mandatory minimum penalties, as shown by . . .  \\ndata analyses and confirmed by interviews of prosecutors and \\ndefense attorneys\"); United States Sentencing Comm\\'n, Fifteen \\nYears of Guidelines Sentencing:  An Assessment of How Well  \\nthe Federal Criminal Justice System is Achieving the Goals  of Sentencing Reform  89 (Nov. 2004) (\"Research over the past \\nfifteen years has consistently found that mandatory penalty \\nstatutes are used inconsistently in cases in which they appear \\nto apply.\"). \\n 13 \\nIndeed, over the last two decades, different \\nAttorneys General have instructed federal prose-\\ncutors differently on how to use mandatory minimum \\nstatutes, switching between more- and less-aggressive \\napproaches.3  In adopting such policies, the executive \\nbranch takes into its own hands the tradeoff between \\nsentencing uniformity, on the one hand, and \\nindividual justice and proportionality, on the other.  Whatever the wisdom of the competing approaches, \\nthat practice emphasizes how mandatory minimum \\nstatutes transfer power over  individual liberty from \\nlawmakers and judges to pr osecutors.  In our adver-\\nsarial system, moreover, pr osecutors can and do use \\nthat power strategically in ways that undermine \\nstructural protections for individual liberties, such as by using the threat of a mandatory minimum to \\nobtain a guilty plea.  See United States v. Kupa ,  \\n976 F. Supp. 2d 417, 420 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) \\n(condemning the practice of \"coerc[ing] guilty pleas, \\nand sometimes . . . coerc[ing] cooperation as well,  \\n[by] routinely threaten[ing] ultra-harsh, enhanced mandatory sentences that no one  – not even the \\nprosecutors themselves – thinks are appropriate\") \\n(footnote omitted),  aff \\'d, 616 F. App\\'x 33  (2d Cir. 2015) . \\n                                                 \\n3 See Angelos , 345 F. Supp. 2d at 1253 & n.120 (discussing a \\n2003 memorandum intended \"to reduce charging disparities \\nstemming from § 924(c)\"); United States Sentencing Comm\\'n, \\nAn Overview of Mandatory Minim um Penalties in the Federal \\nCriminal Justice System 24-25 (July 2017) (comparing the 2013 \\n\"Smart on Crime\" initiative, which outlined circumstances  \\nin which prosecutors should \"\\'decline to charge\\'\" mandatory \\nminimum sentences, to \"revised guidance\" in 2017 directing \\nprosecutors generally to \"\\'charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense,\\'\" with seriousness measured by the \\ngreatest sentence, \" \\'including mandatory minimum sentences\\' \"). \\n 14 \\nNor does the expansion of prosecutorial power \\nthrough mandatory minimum statutes stop at the \\ncharging stage.  Even after conviction, the prosecutor \\nholds an important key to lessening the effect of a \\nmandatory minimum sentence.  A district court is \\nfreed from restrictions on its sentencing discretion \\n\"[u]pon motion of the Government . . . so as to reflect \\na defendant\\'s substantial assistance in the investi-gation or prosecution of another person,\" 18 U.S.C. \\n§ 3553(e), or it can similarly reduce the sentence \\nlater, again with the government\\'s approval, under \\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b)(4).\\n4  Suc h \\ndiscretionary motions have large effects on \\nsentences, often reducing them by many years.5  \\nResearch has found \"enorm ous differences in how \\nprosecutors exercise that di scretion, with substantial \\nvariation by district.\"6  Again, within broad constitu-\\ntional bounds, Congress has the power to create such \\na system.  But the Court need not and should not \\nbroaden more than Congress\\'s language requires \\n                                                 \\n4 In certain cases involving no n-violent drug offenders, a  \\ndistrict judge may invoke 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f), often called a  \\njudicial \"safety valve,\" but the sa fety valve is \"narrow\" and still \\nrequires prosecutorial approval in substance if not in form.   \\nRachel E. Barkow, Categorical Mistakes:  The Flawed Frame-\\nwork of the Armed Career Criminal Act and Mandatory Mini-\\nmum Sentencing , 133 Harv. L. Rev. 200, 218 (2019). \\n5 See United States Sentencing Comm\\'n,  Mandatory Minimum \\nPenalties for Firearms Offenses in the Federal Criminal Justice \\nSystem 42 (Mar. 2018)  (\"In fiscal year 2016, the average sentence \\nfor offenders who remained subject to the mandatory minimum \\npenalty [under § 924(e)] at sentencing was 200 months, signifi-cantly longer than the average sentence for offenders relieved of \\nthis mandatory minimum penalty (112 months).\"). \\n6 Barkow, Categorical Mistakes , 133 Harv. L. Rev. at  224 & \\nn.183, 236 & n.281 (discussing the 2011 and 1991 Reports). \\n 15 \\nstatutes that give prosecutors powers over individual \\nlives traditionally reserved  for independent judges. \\n3. By contrast, the costs of erroneously \\nconstruing a mandatory minimum provision too \\nnarrowly are relatively low, both for individual cases \\nand for the criminal justice system as a whole.  In \\ncases that fall outside the scope of a mandatory \\nminimum, but that nevertheless feature aggravating \\ncircumstances similar to those that moved Congress \\nto impose the minimum, a sentencing judge still has discretion (guided by § 3553(a) and the sentencing \\nguidelines) to impose a more severe sentence.  As Justice Breyer explained in Dean , \"an interpretive \\nerror on the side of leniency[] still permits  the \\nsentencing judge to impose a sentence similar to, \\nperhaps close to, the statutor y sentence even if that \\nsentence . . . is not legislatively required .\"  556 U.S. \\nat 584 (Breyer, J., dissenting). \\nMoreover, \"an error that excludes (erroneously) a \\nset of instances Congress me ant to include . . . could \\nlead the Sentencing Commission to focus on those cases . . . [and] make avail able to Congress a body of \\nevidence and analysis that w ill help it reconsider the \\nstatute.\"  Id. at 585.  Those who bring actions under \\nthe criminal laws (the executive branch) have far greater access to thos e who create them (the \\nlegislative branch) than do those who defend against \\nsuch actions (potential criminal defendants).  In light \\nof this practical reality, the rule of lenity \"places the \\nweight of inertia upon the party that can best induce \\nCongress to speak more clearly.\"  Santos , 553 U.S. at \\n514 (plurality).  \\n 16'}\n",
      "{'B. The Risk of Reading Mandatory Minimums Too Broadly Is Also Particularly High': 'The risk of mistaking congressional intent is also \\nunusually high in the case of mandatory minimum \\nprovisions.  Those provisions often do not originate \\nfrom a careful and considered drafting process.   \\nThe history of the \"occasions different from one \\nanother\" language of § 924(e) (1) is a good example:  \\nas petitioner shows in detail, that language stemmed \\nfrom then-Solicitor-General  Fried\\'s confession of \\nerror to this Court in Petty v. United States , 481 U.S. \\n1034 (1987) (No. 86-6263).  In that case, the United States candidly admitted that the different-occasions \\nlanguage, present in \"other enhanced penalty \\nprovisions,\" was omitted from the predecessor to \\n§ 924(e)(1), even though the legislative history \\nshowed \"that both Congress and those supporting the legislation, including the Department of Justice, did \\nnot intend that the penalty provision would apply \\nmore broadly than in the case of the other federal \\nenhanced penalty statutes.\"   Pet. Br. App. 25a-26a; \\nsee id.  at 26a-31a. \\nHad the United States not taken the unusual step \\nof confessing error in Petty , the courts might well \\nhave concluded – as the Eighth Circuit already had –that Congress had intentionally left the different-occasions language out of th e statute.  After all,  \\nas the Solicitor General\\'s brief pointed out, courts \\nconstruing statutes often draw a \"negative implica-\\ntion\" from the omission of  language in one statute \\nthat is present in anot her, similar statute.  Id. at  \\n26a (citing Rodriguez v. United States , 480 U.S. 522, \\n525 (1987) (per curiam)).  An d courts reaching that \\nconclusion would have imposed minimum 15-year \\nsentences, not based on a \"genuine[] call[] for th[at] \\n 17 \\npunishment\" by \"society[\\'s] . . . representatives,\" R.L.C. , \\n503 U.S. at 309 (Scalia, J., concurrring in part and concurring in the judgment), but based on a slip of the legislative pen. \\nThere are other examples.  Indeed, § 924(e) \\npresents one:  its \"residual clause\" defined a \"violent \\nfelony\" to include any felony that \"involves conduct \\nthat presents a serious potential risk of physical \\ninjury.\"  18 U.S.C. § 924( e)(2)(B)(ii).  This Court \\nstruck that clause down as unconstitutionally vague \\nin Johnson v. United States , 576 U.S. 591 (2015), \\nrelying in part on \"[n]ine years\\' experience trying to derive meaning from the residual clause\" as evidence \\nthat the courts had \"embarked upon a failed enterprise.\"  Id. at 601-02.  And the Court reached \\nthe same conclusion in Davis as to § 924(e)\\'s cousin \\n§ 924(c), striking down a similarly vague clause that \\ntriggered mandatory minimum sentences of 5, 7, 10, and 25 years.  See 139 S. Ct. at 2325, 2336. \\nIn United States v. O\\'Brien , 560 U.S. 218 (2010), \\nthe Court described as \" unclear\" yet another provi-\\nsion of § 924(c) that i mposed a 30-year mandatory \\nminimum sentence for possessing a machinegun \\nwhile committing certain crimes.  Id. at 227, 229.  \\nFacing that lack of clarity, the Court applied a  five-factor test to determine whether machinegun \\npossession was intended to be an offense element  or as a sentencing factor.  See id. at 227-32.  In \\nGranderson , the Court diplomatically observed that \\n18 U.S.C. § 3565(a), imposi ng a mandatory minimum \\nsentence for certain revocations of parole, did not \\n\"appear[] . . . to have received Congress\\' careful \\nattention.\"  511 U.S. at 42.  Justice Scalia less \\ndiplomatically called § 3565(a) \"wretchedly drafted.\"  \\nId. at 60 (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment). \\n 18 \\nThe Court\\'s repeated struggles with opaque text \\nand structure in mandatory minimum provisions  \\nare the kind of \"experience\"  that is \"the life of the \\nlaw.\"  Johnson , 576 U.S. at 601.  That experience \\nteaches that mandatory minimum sentencing statutes, including the one at issue here, commonly \\nuse \"sweeping and imprecise language\" that \"set[s] \\nup a host of vexing constitutional and statutory \\ninterpretation questions for the courts.\"  Barkow, \\nCategorical Mistakes , 133 Harv. L. Rev. at 202.   \\nThe rule of lenity, \"as a so rt of \\'junior version of  \\nthe vagueness doctrine,\\'\" United States v. Lanier , \\n520 U.S. 259, 266 (1997) (quoting Packer, Criminal \\nSanction  at 95), is a useful doctrinal approach to \\nanswering those questions.  If the Court finds the \\nstatute now before it ambiguous, lenity can help – \\nand an emphasis on lenity in the context of \\nmandatory minimum statutes can help guide the \\nlower courts to solve futu re, similar problems that \\nwill inevitably arrive.\\n7 \\n                                                 \\n7 Some have stated that \"a court must find not just ambiguity \\nbut \\'grievous ambiguity\\' before resorting to the rule of lenity.\"  \\nShular v. United States , 140 S. Ct. 779, 788 & n.2 (2020)  \\n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (collecting examples).  Other recent decisions, drawing on a long line of authority, have applied \\nprinciples of lenity without the adjective \"grievous.\"  See, e.g., \\nDavis , 139 S. Ct. at 2333 (invoking lenity where \"a criminal \\nstatute . . . d[id] not clearly proscribe\" conduct and stating that \\n\"ambiguities about the breadth of a criminal statute should  be resolved in the defendant\\'s favor\").  The notion that lenity \\napplies only in cases of \"grievous ambiguity\" appeared in this \\nCourt\\'s cases relatively recently.  See Chapman v. United \\nStates , 500 U.S. 453, 463 (1991) (quoting Huddleston v. United \\nStates , 415 U.S. 814, 831 (1974), which had stated that the \\nCourt \"perceive[d] no grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in\" a \\nstatute before it, id., but did not suggest that \"grievous ambigu-\\nity\" was a threshold requirement for any reliance on lenity).  \\nThe rule of lenity itself goes back for centuries.  In any event, \\n 19'}\n",
      "{'II. JUDICIAL EXPERIENCE WITH 18 U.S.C. section 924(e)(1) SUPPORTS APPLYING THE RULE OF LENITY': 'Petitioner\\'s brief ably sets forth why the Sixth \\nCircuit\\'s analysis finds no support in the ACCA\\'s \\ntext, history, or purpose.  FAMM agrees that this \\nCourt can and should reverse the judgment of the \\nSixth Circuit without resort to the rule of lenity or the principles that underlie it.  If the Court finds the \\nquestion close, however, it may help to consider \\njudicial experience applying the same standard that \\nthe Sixth Circuit applied here.  Examining that \\nexperience counsels in favor of lenity. \\nThat experience shows that the approach of the \\ncourt of appeals – asking wh ether \"it [is] possible to \\ndiscern the point at which the first offense is \\ncompleted and the subsequent point at which the \\nsecond offense begins,\" JA22 – does not satisfy this \\nCourt\\'s teaching that \"so far as possible the line should be clear.\"  McBoyle , 283 U.S. at 27.  Nor does \\nthat test align, in any way \"the common world will \\nunderstand,\" id., with Congress\\'s effo rt to classify as \\nan armed career criminal someone who has \"three previous convictions . . . for a violent felony or a \\nserious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions \\ndifferent from one another, \" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1).  \\nInstead, the temporal-sequencing test is at best \"no \\nmore than a guess as to what Congress intended,\" \\nLadner , 358 U.S. at 178 – a guess that produces \\narbitrary and unpredictable results. \\n                                                                                                   \\nwhere all the tools of statutory construction fail to resolve genu-\\nine ambiguity as to whether Congress has demanded a manda-\\ntory prison term, that ambiguity can fairly be called \"grievous.\" \\n 20'}\n",
      "{'A. Entries of Separate Structures on a Single Day or Night Are Not Clearly Multiple Different \"Occasions\"': '1. The decision under review  is a useful starting \\npoint.  According to the Sixth Circuit, all 10 of Wooden\\'s 1997 convictions for burglary, which took \\nplace on a single night, were \"separate ACCA \\npredicate offenses\" that occurred on \"\\'occasions \\ndifferent from one another.\\'\"  JA21 (quoting 18 \\nU.S.C. § 924(e)(1)).  To support that conclusion, the court of appeals reasoned that, \"[w]hatever the \\ncontours of a \\'mini\\' wareho use, Wooden could not be \\nin two (let alone ten) of them  at once\"; that he \"could \\nhave ceased his criminal conduct\" after entering the \\nfirst warehouse without en tering nine more; and \\nthat, although \"one could characterize th[e] cluster of \\nwarehouses as being adjoined \\'at the same business location,\\'\" they were \"different locations\" because  \\ntheir owners had \"distinct se ts of property rights.\"  \\nJA23-24. \\nWooden argues persuasively (at 30) that the \\n\"textual foundations\" for the court of appeals\\' \"test \\n. . . are essentially nonexistent.\"  Even if the statute \\ndoes not wholly foreclose th at test, it certainly gives \\nno fair warning that unlawfully entering 10 small \\nwarehouses within the same building on a single \\nevening triggers a harsh 15-year penalty for later \\nowning a gun, while spending the same amount  \\nof time in a single warehouse would not.  The court  \\nof appeals\\' analysis thus  \"mak[es] criminal law  \\nin Congress\\'s stead.\"  Santos , 553 U.S. at 514 \\n(plurality).  At best it is judicial doctrine built up  \\nto cover the lack of clarity in the statute, rather  \\nthan anything that can claim to be an application of \\nthe statute itself.  Those who agree with Justice \\nScalia that \"it is not consistent with the rule of lenity \\n 21 \\nto construe a textually ambiguous penal statute \\nagainst a criminal defendant on the basis of legis-\\nlative history,\" R.L.C. , 503 U.S. at 307 (Scalia, J., \\nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment), \\ncan stop there, because the statute is at least \\ntextually ambiguous.   \\nThose who look to legislative history as an \\ninterpretive guide should reach the same ultimate \\nconclusion.  As Wooden persuasively shows (at 21-\\n25), that history ranges fr om an Assistant Attorney \\nGeneral\\'s 1984 testimony that the statute was meant \\nto catch \"people who have demonstrated . . . that \\nlocking them up and letting them go doesn\\'t do any \\ngood,\" Pet. Br. Add. 29a; to the Solicitor General\\'s 1987 concession in Petty that the statute was \\n\"intended\" to cover \"multiple criminal episodes,\" id. \\nat 26a; to then-Senator Biden\\'s 1988 statement that \\nthe statute was meant to \"express[] [a] concept of \\nwhat is meant by a \\'career criminal,\\'\" 134 Cong. Rec. S17,370 (daily ed. Nov. 10, 1988).  None of this \\nsuggests an intent – let alone a clear one – to \\nconsider multiple offenses on a single night to be a \\ncareer in crime because it took a few seconds to move \\nfrom one mini-warehouse to another within a cluster \\nof such warehouses. \\n2. The Fourth Circuit\\'s decision in United States \\nv. Carr , 592 F.3d 636 (4th Cir. 2010), illustrates the \\nsame point.  That case involved Daryl Carr, who possessed a firearm after previously pleading guilty \\nto 13 state-law charges of \"felony breaking or entering.\"  Id. at 638.  Those 13 offenses all took \\nplace on a single day in 2006 during which Carr broke into each of 13 \"different storage unit[s]\" at  \\nthe same street addres s (\"N.C. 32 South\").  Id.  The \\ncourt of appeals conceded that the offenses were \\n\"substantively the same and arguably had the same \\n 22 \\ncriminal objective,\" but it nevertheless found them  \\nto be \"separate and distinct criminal episodes.\"  Id.  \\nat 645.  It reasoned that  the storage units were \\n\"different locations\"; that mo st, though not all, of the \\noffenses had \"different victims\"; and that Carr \"had \\nthe opportunity . . . to cease and desist his criminal \\nbehavior\" between one storage unit and the next, \\nadding in a footnote that \"Carr simply could not have \\nbroken into or entered the 13 separate storage units simultaneously.\"  Id. at 645 & n.8 (citation omitted).\\n8 \\nIn that analysis, the Fourth Circuit asserted that \\nthe statutory \"\\'definition may be clear\\'\" but conceded \\nthat \"\\'the factual permutations surrounding the \\nACCA tend to create havoc\\'\"; that \"\\'courts have \\napplied a multiplicity of factors\\'\" in cases involving \\n§ 924(e); and that the \"analysis\" has a \"fluid nature.\"  Id. at 640 (quoting United States v. Letterlough ,  \\n63 F.3d 332, 335 (4th Cir.  1995)).  That sort of \\nassessment ought to be a warning sign in construing a criminal statute:  it calls to mind this Court\\'s \\nobservation in Johnson that \"pervasive disagreement \\nabout the nature of the inquiry one is supposed to \\nconduct and the kinds of factors one is supposed to \\nconsider\" is a sign of unacceptable vagueness.  576 \\nU.S. at 601.  The present case, to be sure, is not  \\na vagueness challenge.  But the rule of lenity – and  \\nthe \"constitutional principles underlying th[at] rule,\" \\nDavis , 139 S. Ct. at 2333 n. 8 – counsels against \\nadopting a line of authority whose own proponents \\nreport fluidity at best and havoc at worst. \\n                                                 \\n8 In another footnote, the Fourth Circuit noted that Carr had \\nother \"state convictions\" on different dates, at least one of which \\ninvolved \"assault by pointing a gun,\" Carr , 592 F.3d at 639 n.3, \\nbut did not analyze whether they  constituted ACCA predicates \\nor rely on them for its holding. \\n 23 \\n3. The Seventh Circuit\\'s decision in United States \\nv. Hudspeth , 42 F.3d 1015 (7th Cir. 1994) (en banc), \\ninvolved Thomas Hudspeth, who on one day in 1983 broke into three businesses – \"a doughnut shop, a dry \\ncleaners, and an insurance company.\"  Id. at 1018-19.  \\nThe businesses were in the same \"strip mall,\" id., \\nwhere the burglars made \"a hole through [a] shared wall\" and \"forced open the door\" connecting two of \\nthe businesses, id. at 1022.  The whole affair took \\n\"approximately thirty-five minutes.\"  Id. at 1018-19.  \\nA majority of the Seventh Circuit held that, because Hudspeth\\'s three offenses were \"committed sequen-\\ntially, against different victims, at different times, \\nand at different locations,\" they were \"clearly crimes \\n\\'committed on occasions different from one another.\\'\"  Id. at 1021. \\nOne concurrence reasoned that Hudspeth was \\n\"appropriately sentenced because . . . the record shows three separate crimes against separate victims \\nand not a single crime or criminal occasion (whatever that is).\"  Id. at 1025 (Bauer, J., concurring).  One \\npartial dissent noted that past decisions had \"grappl[ed] with the ambi guity of the ACCA\" and \\nnoted \"the malleability of the relevant terms,\" including the different-occasions language.  Id. at \\n1025-26 (Flaum, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Another, joined by  five of the 11 judges who \\nheard the case, agreed that the \"cold print of the \\nstatute books\" did not answ er the question before  \\nthe court and argued for interpreting § 924(e) as  \\na \"congressional mandate . . . to identify the true recidivist.\"  Id. at 1034, 1037 (Ripple, J., concurring \\nin part and dissenting in part).  \\nNone of the opinions in Hudspeth suggested \\napplying the rule of lenity.  Yet at least six members \\n 24 \\nof the en banc court – counting Judge Bauer, whose \\nconcurrence expressed marked frustration with the \\nstatutory language – appear to have found no answer \\nto the question before them in § 924(e).9  As judicial \\nexperience goes, that is further evidence that \\n\"Congress le[ft] to the Judiciary the task of imputing \\nto Congress an undeclared will,\" Bell, 349 U.S. at 83, \\nconcerning prior offenses that occur over a short \\nperiod of time in several adjacent structures.'}\n",
      "{'B. Evading or Resisting Arrest Does Not Clearly Involve Multiple Different \"Occasions\"': 'Another  situation that repeatedly arises under \\n§ 924(e) is an offense af ter which the defendant \\nevades or resists arrest.  A rule that focuses on \\nsequence in time treats evasion or resistance as a \\ndifferent \"occasion,\" because it is possible to imagine a point at which the defendant stops the first offense \\nand starts running.  But an ordinary person trying  \\nto figure out the meaning of the statute from its \\nwords would not likely reach that conclusion.  Nor  \\ndo the tools of statutory construction suggest that \\nCongress meant to treat such an offender as a career \\ncriminal deserving 15 years in prison. \\n1. In United States v. Schieman , 894 F.2d 909 \\n(7th Cir. 1990), David Schi eman received a 15-year \\nsentence based in part on prior convictions of \\nburglary and aggravated batte ry of a police officer.  \\nId. at 910.  As a partial dissent explained:  \\n                                                 \\n9 Hudspeth relied on police reports to determine the circum-\\nstances of prior offenses; Shepard v. United States , 544 U.S. 13, \\n16 (2005), later barred courts from considering police reports  \\nin applying § 924(e).  The Seventh Circuit has since cited  \\nHudspeth as \"abrogated\" at least in part by Shepard .  See, e.g., \\nUnited States v. Elliott , 703 F.3d 378, 384 n.3 (7th Cir. 2012). \\n 25 \\nSchieman committed a robbery, walked three \\nblocks away to make a telephone call [at a phone \\nbooth] to arrange transportation away from the \\nscene, and, in an attempt to evade apprehension, \\npushed a police officer at the phone booth.  The \\npushing incident occurred approximately five \\nminutes after the robbery. \\nId. at 913 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and \\ndissenting in part).  The majority reasoned that, \"[o]nce the original crime is complete, there is no \\nprincipled way to distinguish\" between a battery \\n\"within ten minutes of the burglary\" and one \"a day after the burglary.\"  Id. at  913 (majority). \\nOne giving the words \"different\" and \"occasion\" \\ntheir ordinary meaning might well think that both \\nSchieman\\'s burglary and his attempt to escape five \\nminutes later occurred on the same occasion.  One \\nthinking of the statute as an attempt to identify \\ncareer criminals would reach the same result.  And \\nthe Schieman court\\'s reasoning only emphasizes  \\nhow traditional principles of lenity support that conclusion.  The court took a case it thought clear \\n(escape a day later) and used it to resolve a case  \\nit thought unclear (escape five minutes later) by \\narguing the lack of a \"principled . . . distin[ction]\" \\nbetween the two.  But the felt need to invoke the day-after hypothetical itself shows that the statute does \\nnot speak clearly to the five -minute case.  The court\\'s \\nrole was therefore to limit the 15-year sanction to the \\ncase where it was unambiguously intended. \\n2. In United States v. Davidson , 527 F.3d 703 \\n(8th Cir. 2008), vacated in part on other grounds , 551 \\nF.3d 807 (8th Cir. 2008) (per curiam), Mark Davidson \\nwas sentenced under § 924(e)  based on prior convic-\\ntions that included an attempted domestic assault \\n 26 \\nand fleeing from a police officer who interrupted that \\nattempt with a traffic stop.  Id. at 707.  The Seventh \\nCircuit conceded that the \"pause between the two offenses was brief\" and that the crimes were \\ncommitted in \"rapid succession,\" but reasoned that  \\na \"moment of relative calm\" had occurred when  \\nthe officer stopped Davidson, creating \"a point of \\ndemarcation between episodes\" that justified treating \\nDavidson\\'s prior convictions as separate.  Id. at 710. \\nThe Davidson court candidly acknowledged that \\nthe circuits had \"struggled with th[e] problem\" of applying § 924(e) to resist ance or evasion offenses, \\n\"reaching arguably inconsistent results,\" id. at 709, \\ndiscussing Schieman and other examples.  Considered \\nas an exercise in the common-law method, the \"point of demarcation\" analysis that Davidson derived \\nmight not be exceptional.  But it has been settled \\nsince United States v. Hudson , 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 32 \\n(1812), that \"federal crimes . . . are solely creatures of \\nstatute,\" Liparota v. United States , 471 U.S. 419, 424 \\n(1985), a principle that lenity helps protect, see id. at \\n427-28.  And the distinction that Davidson and cases \\nlike it draw – if it can even be squared with the \\nstatute at all – is clearly a rule made by the courts \\nrather than one set down by statute. \\n3. In Levering v. United States , 890 F.3d 738 (8th \\nCir. 2018), Merwyn Leveri ng was sentenced under \\n§ 924(e) based on prior convictions that included at \\nleast two assaults in the cour se of a high-speed flight \\nfrom police officers in a stolen automobile.  Id. at \\n739.  Levering argued that the assaults were not committed on different occasions because the flight \\nwas a \"\\'continuous course of conduct.\\'\"  Id. at 741.  \\nThe Eighth Circuit acknowledged that \"the phrase \\n\\'continuous course of conduct\\' appears in our cases on \\n 27 \\nthis subject,\" but rejected  it as \"unhelpful to the \\nanalysis.\"  Id. at 742.  Instead, the court relied on the \\nfact that the assaults were committed \"at different times in different counties against different victims.\"  \\nId.  The Eighth Circuit acknowledged that several \\nunpublished decisions from the Sixth Circuit pointed \\nto a different result, but \"respectfully differ[ed]\" with them.  Id.   \\nLike the Fourth Circuit\\'s acknowledgment of \"havoc\" \\nin Carr , the vigorous disagreement among members \\nof the Seventh Circuit in Hudspeth , and the Eighth \\nCircuit\\'s own earlier acknowledgment of \"arguabl[e] \\ninconsisten[cy]\" in Davidson , the reasoning of \\nLevering points to the type of pervasive uncertainty \\nabout statutory application that suggests courts have gone beyond the guidance that an unclear statute \\ncan offer.  It is especially  telling that – as the Eighth \\nCircuit\\'s criticism of the Sixth Circuit shows – courts theoretically applying the sa me sequential test reach \\ndifferent results as to similarly situated defendants. \\n4. None of this is to deny that fleeing from arrest \\nand assaulting someone while doing so is not serious misconduct that state and sometimes federal law \\nproperly criminalize.  The police officer in Schieman \\ncould have been hurt, as could the bystanders to the \\nhigh-speed chases in Davidson and Levering .  Nor is \\nthere any doubt that after their prior convictions the \\nvarious defendants were prohibited from possessing guns, see 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), and could be punished \\nfor breaking that law.  The function of § 924(e), \\nhowever – as its text, structure, and history all show – is to carve out a special set of repeat offenders, \\nlabeled as \"armed career criminals,\" for special \\ncondemnation and harsh mandatory punishment.  It \\nis impossible to read the cases struggling with these \\n 28 \\nissues and conclude that the legislature has \"clearly \\nsaid\" that those defendants should \"languish[] in \\nprison,\" Bass , 404 U.S. at 348 (cit ation omitted), for \\nat least 15 years.'}\n"

      "INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY \n",
      "I. The rule of lenity has an important role to  \n",
      "play in the interpretation of mandatory minimum sentencing statutes and shou ld be given special force \n",
      "in cases that involve them.  Mandatory minimum \n",
      "sentencing statutes pose special threats to individual liberty and the separation of powers.  Experience \n",
      "teaches that such statut e s  l e a d  t o  s e v e r e  a n d  \n",
      "disproportionate sentences, reallocate power from \n",
      "legislators and judges to prosecutors, and often \n",
      "ultimately fail to achieve their ostensible goal of \n",
      "sentencing uniformity.  Experience also teaches that \n",
      "such statutes are poorly drafted and difficult to \n",
      "apply.  Because the costs of overreading harsh \n",
      "sentencing statutes are high , lenity counsels in favor \n",
      "of narrower reading. \n",
      " 3 \n",
      "A. The most obvious cost of error in overreading a  \n",
      "mandatory minimum sentencing statute is the lost liberty of individuals who receive a far longer prison term than the legislature actually intended.  Lenity \n",
      "embodies the courts' \"instinctive distaste[] against \n",
      "men languishing in prison unless the lawmaker has \n",
      "clearly said they should.\"  Henry J. Friendly, \"Mr. \n",
      "Justice Frankfurter and the Reading of Statutes,\" in \n",
      "Benchmarks  196, 209 (1967).  A mandatory 15-year \n",
      "sentence based on less-than-certain evidence of \n",
      "legislative intent is indeed distasteful.  Mandatory \n",
      "minimum statutes like the one here also reflect moral condemnation for a special subgroup of criminals – as \n",
      "shown by Congress's decision to pass an \"Armed \n",
      "Career Criminal Act\" (\"ACCA\") – that should follow \n",
      "only from a genuine legislative decision. \n",
      "Mandatory minimum sentencing statutes also \n",
      "impair courts' efforts to achieve the important goals \n",
      "of fairness and proportionate punishment.  Although Congress has the power (within constitutional \n",
      "bounds) to sacrifice fairness and proportionality to a \n",
      "perceived greater good, courts should not conclude \n",
      "that Congress has done so based on guesswork or \n",
      "speculation about the meaning of an unclear statute.  \n",
      "Often, mandatory minimum sentencing statutes fail \n",
      "to achieve the goal of sentencing uniformity because they place great power in the hands of prosecutors, \n",
      "thus inviting inconsistent and arbitrary application.  \n",
      "Applying the rule of lenity rigorously to such statutes \n",
      "lessens those costs to the system and ensures that \n",
      "they are imposed only when Congress has truly \n",
      "found them justified. \n",
      "By contrast, erring on the side of narrow \n",
      "constructions for mandatory minimum statutes is \n",
      "less risky.  Most importantly, judges always retain \n",
      "power to sentence up to the statutory maximum or to \n",
      " 4 \n",
      "run sentences for multiple offenses consecutively.  \n",
      "They do not need mandatory minimums to determine \n",
      "appropriate sentences based on the nature of an \n",
      "offense or the history and characteristics of an \n",
      "offender.  Moreover, the go vernment is well situated \n",
      "to press for new legislation if dissatisfied with the \n",
      "courts' interpretation.  There is no reason to doubt \n",
      "that prosecutors will call for stronger criminal penalties in response to any true threat to public \n",
      "safety or that legislators will fail to answer such calls. \n",
      "B. The risk of error is particularly acute when \n",
      "courts interpret mandatory minimum sentencing statutes.  As this Court knows all too well, Congress \n",
      "often writes such statutes in a confusing way.  The \n",
      "statutory provision here resulted from a rare \n",
      "confession of error by the Solicitor General that, in \n",
      "essence, Congress had left needed language out of a 15-year sentencing statute and so had inflicted a \n",
      "harsher and broader penalty than anyone involved  \n",
      "in the statute's creation (the Justice Department \n",
      "included) had anticipated.  This Court's recent cases \n",
      "have invalidated other parts of § 924 as unconsti-\n",
      "tutionally vague, and over the years the Court has \n",
      "remarked on similar problems with other mandatory minimum sentencing statutes.  When Congress \n",
      "enacts mandatory minimum sentencing statutes  \n",
      "with enormous effects on future defendants, but \n",
      "gives little consideration to statutory details, the rule \n",
      "of lenity provides a much-needed safeguard for \n",
      "individual liberty. \n",
      "II. The rule of lenity confirms that this Court \n",
      "should reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.  \n",
      "Petitioner Wooden correctly argues that 18 U.S.C. \n",
      "§ 924(e) should be read in his favor even without the \n",
      "rule of lenity.  If any doubt remains, lenity should \n",
      "dispose of it.  That conclusion is further supported  \n",
      " 5 \n",
      "by examining judicial experience with cases under \n",
      "§ 924(e)(1).  The standard endorsed by the court of \n",
      "appeals – under which even a moment's separation \n",
      "between two prior offenses qualifies them as \n",
      "occurring on different occasions – has led to \n",
      "inconsistent results, arbitrary distinctions, and \n",
      "repeated judicial observations about confusion and \n",
      "uncertainty in the statutory scheme. \n",
      "A. One recurring type of situation involves \n",
      "burglaries of related or adjacent structures or dwellings.  Examples include the mini-warehouses at \n",
      "issue here; a group of adjacent storage units at the same street address in United States v. Carr , 592 \n",
      "F.3d 636 (4th Cir. 2010); and three businesses in a \n",
      "single strip mall in United States v. Hudspeth , 42 \n",
      "F.3d 1015 (7th Cir. 1994) (en banc), abrogated on \n",
      "other grounds by Shepard v. United States , 544 U.S. \n",
      "13 (2005).  Whether assessed against the constitu-tional right to fair warnin g or the legislature's sole \n",
      "responsibility under the Constitution to define \n",
      "crimes, the statute does no t clearly classify several \n",
      "break-ins in the course of a day or an hour as prior \n",
      "offenses on \"occasions different from one another.\"  \n",
      "Accordingly, the statute should not be construed to \n",
      "mandate 15 years in prison by treating such offenses \n",
      "as separate violent felonies.  \n",
      "B. Another situation that repeatedly arises under \n",
      "§ 924(e) is an offense co mmitted while the defendant \n",
      "evades or resists arrest for another offense.  \n",
      "Examples include pushing a police officer after \n",
      "committing a robbery, United States v. Schieman , \n",
      "894 F.2d 909 (7th Cir. 1990); fleeing a police officer \n",
      "after a traffic stop that interrupted a domestic \n",
      "assault, United States v. Davidson , 527 F.3d 703  \n",
      "(8th Cir. 2008), vacated in part on other grounds ,  \n",
      "551 F.3d 807 (8th Cir. 2008) (per curiam); and \n",
      " 6 \n",
      "committing two assaults in the course of a single \n",
      "high-speed chase, Levering v. United States , 890 F.3d \n",
      "738 (8th Cir. 2018).  The decisions applying § 924(e) to these situations acknowledge confusion and \n",
      "judicial disagreement, with some courts ruling that any separation of time between the onset of two \n",
      "offenses supports a finding that they occurred on different occasions.  No such rule can be clearly \n",
      "derived from the present statute using ordinary rules \n",
      "of statutory construction.  The courts of appeals should instead have followed the tradition of lenity to \n",

      "{'I. Marcel Cannot Deny The Circuit Split': '.  \\n1. In trying to deny the division with  the Federal \\nCircuit , Marcel ends up highligh ting it.  According to \\nMarcel, Aspex Eyewear, Inc. v. Marchon Eyewear, Inc. , \\n672 F.3d 1335  (Fed. Cir. 2012) , addressed  only \"the \\nwell- established principle that claim preclusion will \\nnot bar a second suit for damages for conduct \\noccurring after the first judgment.\"   BIO.2 3.  In \\nreality, Aspex  also held that  where , as here,  claim \\npreclus ion does not bar a second suit  (because, e.g., the \\nsecond suit  is based on later -occurring conduct , see \\nPet.7) , issue preclusion applies \" only as to \\'matters \\nwhich were actually litigated and determined in the \\nfirst proceeding.\\'\"   Aspex , 672 F.3d at 1343- 44 (quoting \\nCommissioner v. Sunnen , 333 U.S. 591, 597- 98 \\n(1948) ); see Pet.12.   That is the opposite of what  the \\nSecond Circuit held here  in Marcel II .  See Pet.9- 10. \\nMarcel \\'s efforts (at 21- 22) to reconcile Nasalok \\nCoating Corp. v. Nylok Corp. , 522 F.3d 1320 (Fed. Cir. \\n2008) , fare no better.  Nasalok  did not hold that a \\nnever-before-resolved issue was precluded in a second \\nsuit between the parties, but that a plaintiff  is \\nprecluded from litigating claims in a second suit  that \\nconstitute \"a collateral attack on the first judgment .\"  \\nId. at 132 4.  (Nasalok  was defendant in the first case \\nbut petitioner in the second, which it  brought to cancel \\nthe validity of the trademark that formed the basis of Nylok\\'s successful infringement claims in the first case.  Id.  at 1322 .)  Here, by contrast, allowing Lucky  \\n(the defendant)  to raise a defense that was never \\npreviously resolved would in no way \" negate relief \\n3 \\nsecured by [ Marcel ] in the  [2005]  infringement \\nproceeding. \"  Id.  at 1329.  Nor could it, since , as Marcel \\nI held,  the infringement claims on which Marcel \\nprevailed in the 2005 Action  predate the claims here.   \\nSee App. 45-52. \\nMarcel\\'s efforts to explain away Ecolab, Inc. v. \\nParaclipse, Inc. , 285 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2002) , fare \\nworse .  As Marcel notes, the second suit in Ecolab  \"was \\n\\'a new infringement suit involving a new p roduct.\\'\"  \\nBIO.22 (quoting 285 F.3d at 1377).  Marcel says  (at 23)  \\nthat makes Ecolab  \"markedly different\" from  this \\ncase; in reality, the two cases are practically  identical.  \\nIn Ecolab , the second infringement suit alleged that a \\nproduct brought to market after the first case \\ninfringed the same patent in the same way that the product in the first case did.  285 F.3d at 1376 -77.  \\nLikewise here, Marcel alleges that acts that postdate the 2005 Action  infringe the same trademark in the \\nsame way that the acts at issue in the first case did.  Yet, in Ecolab , the Federal Circuit held that the \\ndefendant was not  precluded from asserting invalidity \\nas a defense in the second suit because it was not \\nresolved in the first suit, even though it could have \\nbeen, id., whereas here, the Second Circuit  held \\nexactly the opposite, Pet.9 -14. \\n2. Marcel sings the same off- key tune about  the \\nEleventh Circuit\\'s decision in McKinnon v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Alabama , 935 F.2d 1187 (11th Cir. \\n1991) .  Marcel assert s that McKinnon  is \"wholly \\ninapposite\" because it \"involved different parties with different  claims and very different circumstances. \"  \\nBIO.25.  While the parties and claims certainl y were  \\ndifferent , the legal circumstances were the same . \\n4 \\nIn the first McKinnon case, Belinda McKinnon\\'s \\nfather sued Blue Cross, \" for fraud and bad faith \\nrefusal to pay claims .\"  BIO.24; see 935 F.2d at 11 89-\\n90.  Belinda\\'s father died while that suit was pending , \\nand she \"stepped in\" as plaintiff ( \"as executor of her \\nfather\\'s estate \").  BIO.2 4; see 935 F.2d  at 119 0.  At that \\npoint, Blue Cross could have argued as a defense that \\nBelinda was not a \"participant or beneficiary\" under \\nERISA (and thus not a proper privy) , but it chose not \\nto.  McKinnon, 935 F.2d at 1192- 93.  Belinda later filed \\na second suit against Blue Cross, against  which  Blue \\nCross defended by arguing that Belinda  was not a  \\n\"participant or beneficiary. \"  Id. at 1190.   Although \\nBlue Cross failed to  litigate  that defense in the first \\nsuit, the Eleventh Circuit held that Blue Cros s was not \\nprecluded from raising it  in the second suit , because:  \\n(1) the second suit was not \"based upon the same \\nfactual predicate\" as the first case ( i.e., it involved \\ndifferent claims ); and (2) the defense  was not actually  \\nresolved in the first case.  Id. at 1192.  Both of those \\nare equally true here, yet the Second Circuit reached \\nthe opposite conclusion.  Pet.14 -15. \\n3. Marcel\\'s discussion of the Ninth Circuit\\'s \\ndecision in Orff v. United States, 358 F.3d 1137 (9th Cir. 2004) , is even less helpful to its cause .  As Marcel \\nnotes, in Orff the government \"waived\" a \"sovereign \\nimmunit y defense  … in the first action \" between the \\nparties.   BIO.26; see 358 F.3d at 1150.  Yet the Ninth \\nCircuit held that the government was free to ra ise \\nsovereign immunity as a  defense  in the second suit, \\nbecause: (1) the second suit  \"did not arise from the \\nsame \\'nucleus of facts \\'\" as the first , which meant that \\nclaim preclusion did not apply , and (2) the precise \\n\"grounds upon which\" the government arg ued \\n5 \\nsovereign immunity in the second suit  were not  \\nresolved in the first , BIO.26 , which meant that issue \\npreclusion did not apply .  Orff, 358 F.3d at 1144 ; see \\nPet.16.   Again, that is exactly the opposite of what the \\ncourt held here .   \\nThe decision below thus squarely conflicts with \\nFederal, Eleventh, and Ninth Circuit  cases.'}\n",
      "{\"II. Marcel Cannot Reconcile The Decision Below With This Court's Precedents Or With The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\": '. \\n1. Marcel argues (at 1 7-18) that the Second \\nCircuit\\'s  decisions in this litigation  \"are [c]onsistent \\nwith\" Lawlor v. National Screen Service Corp. , 349 \\nU.S. 322 (1955) .  Lawlor held that a prior judgment \\n\"cannot be given the effect of extinguishing claims \\nwhich did not even then exist and which could not \\npossibly have been sued upon in the previous ca se.\"  \\nId. at 328.   That is consistent with Marcel I —which \\nmeans, notwithstanding Marcel\\'s assertions to the \\ncontrary, the claims her e are not  \"the same \" as the \\n2005 Action.   Contra  BIO.16 .  After all, Marcel I  held, \\nand Marcel II  agreed,  that Marcel\\'s claims in the \\npresent litigation are not precluded by the 2005 Action precisely because they arise from acts that postdate \\nthat earlier suit,  and thus are not  the same .  App.45 -\\n52; see Pet.7. \\nMarcel\\'s  argument  (at 18- 21) that the judgment \\nbelow is consistent with Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322 (1979) , is similarly  unhelpful to Marcel .  \\nParklane \"approv[ed] the \\'offensive\\' use of collateral \\nestoppel\" ( i.e., issue preclusion) \"by a non -party to a \\nprior lawsuit.\"  United States v. Mendoza , 464 U.S. \\n154, 158- 59 (1984)  (discussing Parklane ).  Specifically , \\n6 \\nParklane upheld the application of issue preclusion \\nwith respect to issues of fact that were actually \\nlitigated and resolved against the defendants  in SEC \\nproceedings in a subsequent case brought by nonparties to those proceedings.  439 U.S.  at 331- 33.  \\nWhatever the merits of nonmutual collateral estoppel, see generally  Mendoza, 464 U.S. at 157 -60, the \\nconclusion that \"there is no unfairness \" in precluding \\nrelitigation of issues that were actually litigated to conclusion  against a defendant in a prior case  has no \\nbearing here.  After all, t he question her e is whether \\nthe Second Circuit was correct to apply \"preclusion\" to bar litigation of issues that were never resolved in any \\nprior case.  Pet.i, 1 -2, 16-22. \\nThe Second Circuit answered that question in the \\naffirmative  in Marcel II , reasoning that allow ing \\nLucky to raise a defense it could have litigated to judgment in a prior case , but chose not to,  would mean \\n\"tolerat[ ing]\" \"inefficiencies.\"  BIO.20 (quoting \\nApp.15); see BIO.19.   Although efficiency concerns  \\nmight justify application of issue preclusion in some \\nnonmutual settings where the issue was actually \\nresolv ed in  a prior case, it is another thing entirely to \\npreclude  litigation of issues never previously  decided.   \\nThe same \"inefficiencies\" the Second Circuit cited are \\npresent every time a defendant could have litigated an \\nissue in an earlier proceeding, but chose not to.  And \\nyet it has been the law of the land for nearly 150 years \\nthat a \"defendant is free\" in such cases  \"to raise \\ndefenses that were equally available but omitted  from \\nthe first action.\"  18 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. \\nMiller, Federal Practice & Procedure § 4414 (3d ed. \\n2019) (emphasis added) ; see Pet.18- 19 (citi ng cases).  \\n7 \\n2. Marcel , however, attempts to reject that \\nfundamental premise .  See BIO. 26-29.  All that is \\nrequired to d ispel  Marcel\\'s revisionist history  is to \\nread this Court\\'s opinions.   In 1876 , this Court held \\nthat in \"a subsequent action between the same parties \\nupon a different  [claim] ,\" issue preclusion applies \\n\"only upon [a] matter actually at issue and determined  \\nin the original action.\"  Davis v. Brown , 94 U.S. (4 \\nOtto) 423 , 428 -29 (1876)  (emphasis added) .  The \\ndecision below reached exactly the opposite \\nconclusion.   Pet.19 . \\nMarcel asserts that \" Davis was different \" because \\nthe second suit  between the parties  there  \"arose out of \\ndifferent documents\" than the first case.  BIO.27.  T o \\nbe sure, this case \" is based on the same bran d\" and the \\nsame trademark as the 2005 Action.  BIO.28.  But  that \\nis of no moment.  T he acts of alleged infringement  that \\nform the basis of the claims here  postdate  the 2005 \\nAction , and thus are not the same as the claims \\nlitigated in that prior case .  See supra.  A s this Court \\nrecently re -confirmed yet again , claim s \"predicated on \\nevents that postdate the filing of\" a prior case  are not \\nthe \"same\" as any prior claims for purposes of \\npreclusion.  Hellerstedt , 136 S. Ct. at 2305 .  Marcel\\'s \\nsole distinction between the decision below and Davis  \\nis thus no distinction at all . \\nMarcel next argues that Cromwell v. County of \\nSac, 94 U.S. (4 Otto) 351 (1876) , held that issue \\npreclusion attaches to \" defenses that  were raised or \\ncould have been raised by the defendant\" in a prior suit between the parties.  BIO.27 (emphasis added).   That \\nis simply not so .  Cromwell  held in no uncertain terms  \\nthat issue preclusion applies only to issues  that were \\n8 \\n\"actually litigated and determined  in the original \\naction, not what might have been thus litigated and \\ndetermined .\"  94 U.S. at 353 (emphasis added) ; see \\nPet.22.   If any argument is  \"untrustworthy ,\" BIO.27 , \\nit is one that denies  that a case  says what it says.1 \\nFinally, Marcel dismisses \"[t]he remainder of\" \\nthis Court\\'s cases  that have reject ed the Second \\nCircuit \\'s position  as either \"hav[ing] no relevance\" or \\ninvolving \"vastly different\" claims.  BIO.28 -29.  To \\nstate that argument is to refute it.  The fact that prior \\nprecedents did not involve trademarks (and thus were \\n\"different\") does not change the fact that the decision below flies in the face of 150 year s of this Court\\'s  \\nprecedent .  To state the obvious, the law of preclusion \\ndoes not apply differently in trademark cases than in \\nsecurities cases, patent cases, or an y other type of \\ncase.   Nor does Marcel\\'s insistence that this Court\\'s \\nprecedents are irrelevant make it so.  \\n3. Marcel points out that the Second Circuit did \\nnot \"rely on the distinction between permissible or \\ncompulsory counterclaims.\"  BIO.30.   But the fa ct that \\nthe Second Circuit ignored the Federal Rules of Civil \\nProcedure does not make its decision any less \\n                                            \\n1 Unfortunately, th is is not an isolated occurrence .  Marcel \\nclaims that Commissioner v. Sunnen  held only that issue \\npreclusion was  \"inapplicable because  [of a] change  in the \\nlaw … between the first and second case .\"  BIO.29.  In reality, \\nSunnen  provided a full -throated restatement of Davis  and \\nCromwell .  Pet.17 -18 (quoting 333 U.S. at 598).   Moreover, the \\npassage Marcel block- quotes (at 27 -28) addresses claim \\npreclus ion simpliciter , but Lucky was the defendant  in the 2005 \\nAction as to  Marcel\\'s infringement  counterclaim , Pet.5 , which is \\nwhy not even the Second Circuit found claim preclusion relevant \\nto the release defense. \\n9 \\ninconsistent with them.  C ompulsory counterclaim s \\ncannot be raised at a later time  if \"not brought\" at the \\nfirst opportunity , but permissive counter claims are \\nnot similarly \"barred .\"  Baker v. Gold Seal Liquors, \\nInc., 417 U.S. 467, 469 n.1 (1974) ; see Pet.22- 23.  And \\nhere, Lucky\\'s release defense was not a compulsory \\ncounterclaim  under Rule 13 , Pet.23 ; indeed , Marcel \\ndoes not attempt to argue otherwise.  Y et the Second \\nCircuit effectively treated  it as a compulsory \\ncounterclaim, deeming it precluded because Lucky did \\nnot litigate  it to judgment in the 2005 Action .'}\n",
      "{\"III. Marcel's Vehicle Objections Are Illusory\": '. \\nMarcel goes to lengths to argue that the question \\npresented is not actually presented, but its efforts  only \\nserve to confirm the need for this Court\\'s intervention.  \\n1. Marcel asserts that Lucky \"wa ived the[] \\ndefense\" that Marcel previously  released infringement \\nclaims postdating May 2003 \" by stipulating to the \\njointly drafted 2010 Final Order and Judgment.\"  \\nBIO.15; see also  BIO.31 -32 (\" the Release Defense was \\nRaised the n Waived \").  But Marcel cites no support for \\nthe proposition that  preclusion attaches whenever a \\nparty \"stipulat[es] to\" an adverse judgment in a case in which the issue could have been resolved, but was \\nnot.  That is because no cases support that proposit ion. \\n\"The fundamental rationale of issue preclusion \\ndictates the clearly settled requirement that it be \\nlimited to matters that have been actually decided.\"  \\nWright & Miller  § 4420.  Marcel does not argue that \\nthe validity of Lucky\\'s release defense was actually \\ndecided in the 2005 Action.  Nor could it.  As the court \\nof appeals explaine d below (and as Marcel admits), \\nLucky did not \"fully litigate[] the release defense in \\n10 \\nthe 2005 Action.\"  App.20; see BIO.2 (admitting that \\nLucky \"never pursued\" the release defense in the 2005 \\nAction).  Moreover, while a \"stipulation  … may be \\nbinding in l ater stages of a continuing proceeding,\" \\nissue preclusion \"does not attach unless it is clearly shown that the parties intended that the issue be foreclosed in other litigation.\"  Wright & Miller § 4443 .  \\nAnd Marcel does not  (and cannot)  claim that Lucky \\nintended  to forfeit the release defense.\\n2  In all events, \\nthe dispositive question is whether the issue was \"raised and necessarily resolved  by a prior judgment ,\" \\nBravo -Fernandez v. United States, 137 S. Ct. 352, 358 \\n(2016)  (emphasis added), and even Marcel admits  that \\nthe defense was not resolved in the 2005 Action.  \\n2. Marcel\\'s judicial  estoppel argument misstate s \\nthe record .  At summary judgment, Lucky successfully \\nargued that the parties\\' prior settlement  did not bar \\ninfringement  claims  against Marcel  \"based on events \\noccurring after the spring of 20 04.\"  Order, Lucky \\nBrand Dungarees, Inc. v. Ally Apparel Res. LLC, \\nNo. 1:05-cv-06757 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 16, 2007) , Dkt. 148.  \\nLucky never argued that the release allowed Marcel  to \\nsue for acts that postdated the agreement.  \\n3. Nor does \"[t] he pla in language of the 2003 \\nRelease\" defeat a release defense, BIO.35 , which is \\nwhy Lucky never adopted the position Marcel \\nascribes .  As the district court  explained, Marcel does \\nnot allege here \" that Lucky Brand is using the GET \\nLUCKY mark, but rather that Lucky Brand\\'s \\n                                            \\n2 Marcel chides Lucky  for failing \"even [to] mention\" that  it \\ndeclined  to pursue the release  issue in the 2005 Action,  BIO.15, \\nbut the petition  clearly  explained why Lucky did so , see Pet.25 -\\n26. \\n11 \\ncontinued use of the Lucky Brand Marks infringes \\nrights established by the Final Order and Judgment.\"  App.31.  And as the Second Circuit confirmed, Marcel \\nreleased \" any and all cl aims arising out of or in any \\nway relating to Lucky Brand\\'s rights to use, license \\nand/or register the trademark LUCKY BRAND [marks] owned, registered  and/or used by Lucky \\nBrand … as of the date of th[e]  Agreement .\"  App.4  \\n(ellipsis in original) .  While the universe of marks the \\nrelease covered was limited  to those owned  \"as of the \\ndate of th[e]  Agreement ,\" the universe of claims  \\nMarcel released was not similarly time -limited.  \\nIn all events, whether Lucky or Marcel is correct \\nabout the scope of the release has no bearing on the certworthiness of this case.   The Second Circuit\\'s sole \\nholding below was that Lucky \"is barred from asserting the Release as a defense\" because it could have litigated that issue to judgment in the prior suit between the parties, but  chose not to.  App.22.  And \\nbecause p reclusion is  antecedent to the merits of the \\nrelease issue, absent reversal, Lucky will have no opportunity to make its case  about the scope of the \\nrelease.  The issue on which the Second Circuit departed from three other circuits\\' decisions and \\nnearly 150 years of this Court\\'s precedents is thus \\nsquarely presented.  \\n12'}\n"

No principle compels \\nsuch an anomalous result, and this Court should not \\ncreate an Article III except ion that excludes nominal-\\ndamages awards from ordinary justiciability rules. \\nThe officials do not contest that their actions \\ncaused Chike and Joseph real injury. Their argument is that nominal damages do not redress past injuries. \\nBut nominal damages vindic ate constitutional viola-\\ntions, including where the harm is not quantifiable. \\nMemphis Cmty. Sch. Dist. v. Stachura , 477 U.S. 299, \\n308 n.11 (1986) (quoting Carey v. Piphus , 435 U.S. \\n247, 266 (1978)). And contrary to the Eleventh Circuit\\u2019s belief, they do so \\u201cfor the plaintiff\\u2019s benefit.\\u201d \\nFarrar v. Hobby , 506 U.S. 103, 113 (1992). Those \\nprinciples, common-law history, and common sense all show that a nominal-damages award provides a \\npersonal, tangible benefit that redresses a plaintiff\\u2019s \\ninjury. Article III requires nothing more. \\nProviding a remedy to plaintiffs like Chike and \\nJoseph has neither flooded the courts with lawsuits \\nnor bankrupted officials in the many circuits that \\nallow standalone nominal-damages awards. Nominal \\ndamages, like compensato ry damages, have \\u201ccoex-\\nisted with our constitutional system since the dawn of the Republic.\\u201d Tanzin v. Tanvir , __ S. Ct. __, 2020 WL \\n7250100, at *5 (Dec. 10, 2020). And a nation of laws \\nrequires  a way for courts to make things right when \\nofficials violate rights. Because nominal-damages claims satisfy Arti cle III, this Court should reverse. \\n2 \\nREPLY ARGUMENT  \\nI. T h i s  C o u r t  s h o u l d  d e c l i n e  t o  c r e a t e  a n  \\nArticle III exception that excludes nominal-\\ndamages awards from ordinary justicia-\\nbility rules. \\nThe officials do not deny that Chike and Joseph \\nsuffered a concrete injury-in-fact, nor do they deny \\ncausation. Their only objection is redressability. In making that objection, they confuse redressability \\nwith quantifiability . Because nominal damages \\nvindicate past legal violations, Chike and Joseph\\u2019s nominal-damages claims s atisfy Article III and are \\nnot moot. \\nA. Nominal damages redress past constitu-\\ntional injury. \\nArticle III standing requires  a plaintiff to show he \\nhas suffered (1) a concrete and particularized injury-\\nin-fact, (2) caused by the defendant, (3) that is likely \\nto be redressed by a favorable court ruling. Spokeo, \\nInc. v. Robins , 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016). The \\nofficials do not dispute injury or causation. And \\nredressability requires only that a plaintiff personally \\n\\u201cbenefit in a tangible way from\\u201d court intervention. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\\u2019t , 523 U.S. 83, \\n103 n.5 (1998) (quotation omitted). A plaintiff \\nsatisfies that test by showing that a court order would \\n\\u201cpartially redress\\u201d his injury. Meese v. Keene , 481 U.S. \\n465, 476 (1987). Nominal-damages awards, though \\nsmall, satisfy that standard.\\n1 \\n \\n1 The officials articulate a second redressability requirement: \\nthat the relief \\u201ctarget and redress the plaintiff\\u2019s asserted injury\\u201d \\nrather than someone else\\u2019s. Resp.Br.12. But that is no different \\nthan requiring that the remedy \\u201cpersonally\\u201d benefit the plaintiff. \\n3 \\nThe officials confuse redressability with quanti-\\nfiability. Consider a studen t who shared her faith on \\ncampus by chalking messages about Jesus Christ on \\nthe sidewalk, only to see a professor direct his class to erase them.\\n2 Even if the officials modified their \\npolicies to prevent this First Amendment violation \\nfrom happening again, the officials admit that this student could litigate to final judgment her 1\\u00a2 \\ncompensatory-damages claim for the consumed chalk. \\nEven a single penny of relief partially benefits the stu-dent personally and in a tangible way. \\nNow consider Chike. The officials do not dispute \\nhe was injured when they twice stopped him from speaking. The problem is that he cannot monetize the \\nlost speech\\u2019s value. But Chike\\u2019s lost speech is far more \\nvaluable than the consumed chalk. And it is the lost \\nspeech that gives Chike the right to seek judicial \\nredress; the $1 in nominal damages that officials \\nmust pay Chike is no less a partial redress that personally and tangibly benefits him than is the \\npenny that redresses the chalk user. A nominal-\\ndamages award \\u201cmodifies th e defendant\\u2019s behavior \\nfor the plaintiff\\u2019s benefit by forcing the defendant to \\npay an amount of money he otherwise would not pay.\\u201d \\nFarrar , 506 U.S. at 113. And in this way, the payment \\nof nominal damages \\u201cmaterially alters\\u201d the parties\\u2019 \\nlegal relationship, id. at 111\\u201312, in the same way as \\na modest compensatory-damages award. \\n \\n \\n2 Compare with Fresno State Students for Life  v. Thatcher , No. \\n1:17-at-00382 (E.D. Cal.), available at https://perma.cc/566E-\\n6EBZ. . \\n4 \\nThe officials say that whil e one dollar in compen-\\nsatory damages redresses a past injury, one dollar in \\nnominal damages does not. Resp.Br.17\\u201319. Again, \\nthis is confusion over quantifiability. Contra City of \\nRiverside v. Rivera , 477 U.S. 561, 574 (1986) \\n(plaintiff\\u2019s vindication of \\u201cimportant civil and \\nconstitutional rights that cannot be valued solely in monetary terms\\u201d). Courts  award nominal damages \\nprimarily when there has been an \\u201cinfraction of a \\nlegal right\\u201d but the \\u201cextent of loss is not shown.\\u201d C\\nHARLES T. MCCORMICK , HANDBOOK ON THE LAW OF \\nDAMAGES  \\u00a7 20 at 85 (1935). So it\\u2019s not that nominal \\ndamages offer \\u201c zero legally recognized relief for a past \\ninjury,\\u201d Resp.Br.19 (emphasis added), it\\u2019s that they \\noffer partial relief. Skyline Wesleyan Church v. Cal. \\nDep\\u2019t of Managed Health Care , 968 F.3d 738, 749 (9th \\nCir. 2020) (\\u201cNominal damages would redress \\nSkyline\\u2019s injury, even if only to a minimal extent.\\u201d). \\nAnd because nominal dama ges \\u201cmaterially alter[  ]\\u201d \\nthe parties\\u2019 relationship, Farrar , 506 U.S. at 111\\u201312, \\nthat is sufficient for Article III. Meese , 481 U.S. at 476. \\n\\u201cNothing more is needed to establish redressability.\\u201d Skyline , 968 F.3d at 749. Otherwise, justiciability of \\nidentical claims turns on mere semantics. ACLU Br. \\n11\\u201312 (discussing Freenor v. Mayor & Alderman of \\nSavannah , No. CV414-247, 2019 WL 9936663 (S.D. \\nGa. May 20, 2019)). \\nAs this Court intimated in Carey , nominal dam-\\nages make a constitutional deprivation \\u201cactionable.\\u201d \\n435 U.S. at 266. That is because they redress a plain-\\ntiff\\u2019s concrete and particula rized injury in a personal, \\ntangible way. U.S.Br.17\\u201319 (same result if Congress \\nauthorized a minimum $1,000 award for First \\nAmendment violations). A nominal-damages award partially redresses a loss of incalculable value. \\n5 \\nB. This Court\\u2019s decisions confirm that \\nnominal damages\\u2019 primary purpose is \\npast redress of valuable\\u2014even \\npriceless\\u2014rights. \\nNominal damages\\u2014like other remedies\\u2014have \\nmultiple effects that can include the declaration of \\nrights or the protection of prospective rights. But this \\nCourt\\u2019s precedents and numerous lower-court \\ndecisions show that nominal damages\\u2019 primary \\npurpose is to redress past legal violations. \\nCarey  decided that nominal damages, rather than \\npresumed damages, were the appropriate award for \\nconstitutional violations where harm cannot be mon-etized. 435 U.S. at 266. But the context was not \\u201cpro-\\nspective redress.\\u201d Contra Resp.Br.24. It was about \\nremedying a past \\u201cdeprivation\\u201d of rights. 435 U.S. at \\n266. That is why the Court did not speak in terms of \\nany \\u201cprospective\\u201d due-process problem but to the past \\n\\u201cdenial of procedur al due process.\\u201d Ibid. Accord, e.g., \\nStachura , 477 U.S. at 308 & n.11 (same point in free-\\nspeech context); Arizonans for Official English v. \\nArizona , 520 U.S. 43, 69 & n.24 (1997) (contrasting \\nnominal damages and injunctive relief). \\nLikewise, in Farrar , the plaintiff dropped a claim \\nfor injunctive relief and pursued only an unsuccessful compensatory-damages claim.  506 U.S. at 106. In \\ndetermining that a nominal-damages award made the \\nplaintiff a prevailing party under \\u00a7  1983, this Court \\nemphasized that \\u201c Carey  obligates a court to award \\nnominal damages when a plaintiff establishes the \\nviolation of his [constitutional] right.\\u201d Id. at 112. That \\nis, this Court correctly saw the award of nominal \\ndamages as retrospective redress, not prospective \\nprotection. \\n6 \\nUnsurprisingly, lower courts have consistently \\nrelied on this Court\\u2019s cases to hold that a plaintiff \\nwhose constitutional rights have been violated \\n\\u201cshould not lose his right to proceed\\u201d if \\u201conly nominal damages are at stake.\\u201d Amato v. City of Saratoga \\nSprings , 170 F.3d 311, 319 (2d Cir. 1999) (discussing \\nCarey ). Petitioners\\u2019 opening brief discussed many \\nsuch cases. Pet.Br.27\\u201328. Yet the officials fail to \\nrespond to many. There are more examples, in count-\\nless settings. E.g., ACLU Br. 13\\u201319; Found. for \\nIndividual Rights in Educ. [FIRE] Br. 5\\u20139; Becket Fund Br. 20\\u201325; Pacific Legal Found. Br. 1\\u20134, 12\\u201316.  \\nThe officials\\u2019 rule also vi olates this Court\\u2019s prece-\\ndent in analogous contexts. For example, the officials \\ninsist that statutory damages are \\u201cdifferent in kind\\u201d \\nbecause they \\u201cdo not signify nothing .\\u201d Resp.Br.19\\u201320. \\nBut statutory and nominal damages serve the same \\npurpose: providing \\u201crecompense for injury\\u201d where \\n\\u201cthe rules of law render diff icult or impossible proof of \\ndamages.\\u201d Douglas v. Cunningham , 294 U.S. 207, 209 \\n(1935). The officials concede that it \\u201cis good enough \\nfor Article III\\u201d when Congre ss sets statutory damages \\nwhere it \\u201cmight be hard to measure\\u201d actual damages. \\nResp.Br.19\\u201320. It is no different when courts award \\nnominal damages for the same reason. \\nThe same is true of liquidated damages, which \\nassign a fixed value to harm where actual damages \\n\\u201cmay be difficult or impossible to ascertain.\\u201d Rex \\nTrailer Co. v. United States , 350 U.S. 148, 153\\u201354 \\n(1956). And punitive dama ges are non-compensatory \\nand sometimes awarded without compensatory harm. U.S.Br.19\\u201320. Yet the offici als do not dispute that a \\nplaintiff with a standalone claim for statutory, \\nliquidated, or punitive da mages has failed to present \\nan Article III case or controversy. \\n7 \\nThe officials criticize Chike and Joseph for \\nequating \\u201cvindication\\u201d of rights with Article III \\nredress. Resp.Br.21\\u201323. But where \\u201cthere has been a \\nviolation of a right, the person injured is entitled to an action. If he is entitled to an action, he is entitled \\nat least to nominal damages,  or else he would not be \\nentitled to a recovery.\\u201d Parker v. Griswold , 17 Conn. \\n288, 303 (1846). \\nC. At common law, courts routinely award-\\ned standalone nominal damages solely to redress past injuries. \\nNo one disputes that English and American \\ncommon-law courts consistently adjudicated claims for nominal damages in a wide array of cases, and \\nthat such claims arose from a past violation of rights. \\nYet the officials insist that when common-law courts \\ndid award nominal damages, it was only for \\ncontinuing or threatened injuries. Resp.Br.28\\u201340. \\nCenturies of cases debunk this theory. \\nFor one thing, the officials concede that entire cat-\\negories of common-law cases involved the award of \\nnominal damages even \\u201cwhe n they would not plainly \\nserve as prospective relief.\\u201d Id. at 34. These include \\ncases (like this one) when the plaintiff \\u201cproved a legal \\nviolation\\u201d but failed to establish or quantify compensatory damages, ibid. , \\u201cas a vehicle for costs,\\u201d \\nid. at 32\\u201334, or for \\u201cdignitary harms,\\u201d id. at 38. And \\nthese categories of cases\\u2014which alone undermine the officials\\u2019 historical analysis\\u2014are just a few examples. \\nEnglish courts inferred nominal damages when-\\never the plaintiff establish ed an invasion of a legal \\nright, no matter if ther e was a continuing or \\nthreatened injury. \\u201c[I]njury imports a damage, \\nthough it does not cost the party one farthing.\\u201d Ashby  \\n8 \\nv. White , 92 Eng. Rep. 126, 137 (1703) (Holt, J.). \\nCourts \\u201cimport[ed] a dama ge\\u201d for various claims, \\nincluding breach of contract, trespass, and personal \\ninjury. Ibid.  (\\u201ca cuff on the ear\\u201d would be actionable \\n\\u201cfor it is a personal injury\\u201d).  \\nFor personal rights, nominal damages served to \\nremedy past harms, not to  protect against future \\ninjury. In Ashby , for example, the House of Lords held \\nthat an elector who was wrongfully turned away from \\nthe polls by an official could sue without proving the \\u201cpossibility of a future profi t\\u201d or the \\u201cpossibility of a \\nfuture\\u201d damage. 87 Eng. Rep. 810, 810, 813 (1703) \\n(Powell, J., & Gould, J.). Often these violations occurred when an official fa iled to perform his duty \\nbut cured the defect before suit. In these cases, plain-\\ntiffs could still recover nominal damages for the past \\ninjury even though they had no need for prospective \\nrelief. E.g., Barker v. Green , 130 Eng. Rep. 327, 327 \\n(1824) (sheriff\\u2019s one-day delay in arrest on writ); Bales \\nv. Wingfield , 4 Q.B. 580, n. (multi-week delay by \\nsheriff in executing a lien writ); Clifton  v. Hooper , 115 \\nEng. Rep. 175, 175, 178 (1844) (sheriff delay in exe-cuting process). This was al so true for actions brought \\nagainst private citizens. E.g., Marzetti v. Williams , \\n109 Eng. Rep. 842, 845\\u201347 (1830) (one-day delay in issuing check); Godefroy  v. Jay, 131 Eng. Rep. 159, \\n159\\u201362 (1831) (client could receive nominal damages \\nfor attorney\\u2019s negligence). \\nAmerican courts followed suit. Plaintiffs could \\nrecover at least nominal damages for injuries caused \\nby public officials without showing the threat of future harm. E.g.,  Mickles v. Hart , 1 Denio 548, 550 \\n(N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1845) (sheriff deputy\\u2019s delay in \\nexecuting debt); Laflin v. Willard , 33 Mass. 64, 67 \\n(1835) (same); Waterhouse v. Waite , 11 Mass. 207, 210 \\n9 \\n(1814) (same); Burns v. Erben , 26 How. Pr. 273, 277 \\n(N.Y. Super. Ct. 1864) (false imprisonment); Doherty  \\nv. Munson , 127 Mass. 495, 496 (1879) (detention \\nunder illegal warrant). And American courts routinely awarded nominal damages in private \\nactions when such an award could provide no \\nprospective relief. E.g., Thompson  v. New Orleans, J. \\n& G.N.R. Co. , 50 Miss. 315, 320 (1874) (train \\nconductor passed passenger\\u2019s stop by two miles); \\nCrosby v. Humphreys , 60 N.W. 843, 844 (Minn. 1894) \\n(assault); Young v. W. Union Tel. Co. , 11 S.E. 1044, \\n1044\\u201345 (N.C. 1890) (negligent delay in delivering \\ntelegraph); McKim  v. Bartlett , 129 Mass. 226, 229 \\n(1880) (estate administrator liable for at least nomi-nal damages after court discharged future liability).  \\nThis partial list shows that early American \\ncourts\\u2014like their English counterparts\\u2014undeniably \\nawarded nominal damages so lely for past injuries. \\nAccord, e.g., U.S.Br.10\\u201311; Nat\\u2019l Right to Work Legal \\nDef. Found. Br. 4\\u201310. \\nEven a nominal-damages award in a trespass, \\nriparian-rights, or other pr operty case was intended, \\nfirst and foremost, to vindicate the past \\u201cviolation of \\nthe plaintiff\\u2019s right.\\u201d Delaware & Hudson Canal Co.  \\nv. Torrey , 33 Pa. 143, 148 (1859); accord Embrey v. \\nOwen , 155 Eng. Rep. 579, 585 (1851) (same). And that \\nis why common-law courts awarded nominal damages \\nin property cases even when the parties\\u2019 future rights \\nand obligations were not at stake. E.g., Hefley  v. \\nBaker , 19 Kan. 9, 11 (1877) (pure trespass case with \\nno property-line dispute); Curtis v. Paggett , 27 P. 109, \\n109\\u201310 (Kan. 1891) (same); Cook v. Loomis , 26 Conn. \\n483, 486 (1857) (trover case where property already \\nreturned); Mears v. Cornwall , 40 N.W. 931, 932\\u201334 \\n(Mich. 1888) (same); Warder v. Baldwin , 8 N.W. 257, \\n10 \\n258 (Wis. 1881) (same); Moon v. Raphael , 132 Eng. \\nRep. 122, 122 (1835) (same). And plaintiffs at common \\nlaw could waive their right to compensatory damages \\nand choose to seek nominal damages alone. Pet.Br.42; \\naccord Daniels v. Bates , 2 Greene 151, 152 (Iowa \\n1849); Pastorius v. Fisher , 1 Rawle 27, 29 (Pa. 1828). \\nThe officials\\u2019 failure to address so many of these \\ncases is no mere oversight. Many are on all fours with \\nthe constitutional violations at issue here and \\nestablish the common-law ru le that nominal damages \\nsupport a claim for past constitutional violations. So \\ndo cases involving intentional torts. Frederick \\nDouglass Found. Br. 6\\u20138 (c omparing Petitioners\\u2019 \\ninjuries to those caused by intentional torts, for which \\ncourts awarded nominal damages); Stachura , 477 \\nU.S. at 306 (level of \\u00a7  1983 damages \\u201cdetermined \\naccording to principles de rived from the common law \\nof torts\\u201d). \\nThe officials say that, even if common-law courts \\nawarded nominal damages with no \\u201cprospective \\nremedial benefits,\\u201d such awards were meaningless \\nand insufficient \\u201cfor maintaining an action.\\u201d Resp.Br.35\\u201336. But as detailed above, countless cases \\nheld that a standalone nominal-damages claim \\nsustained a case having no effect on future rights. It would be passing strange for so many courts, over so \\nmany years, to adjudicate  nominal-damages claims \\nthat they thought served no purpose and, in the officials\\u2019 view, violated redressability requirements. \\nFinally, while early common-law courts may have \\nbeen unwilling to reverse a trial court\\u2019s failure to award nominal damages in trifling or frivolous cases, \\nResp.Br.34\\u201335; Fleming  v. Gilbert , 3 Johns 528, 532 \\n(N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1808); Robertson v. Gentry , 5 Ky. 542, \\n11 \\n543 (Ct. App. 1812), that reluctance faded when \\n\\u201cimportant\\u201d rights were at stake. Blackburn v. Ala. \\nGreat S. R. Co. , 39 So. 345, 346 (Ala. 1905); Hecht  v. \\nHarrison , 40 P. 306, 309\\u201310 (Wyo. 1895). Modern \\ncourts view nominal damages the same way when a \\nplaintiff alleges a constitutional violation. E.g., Risdal \\nv. Halford , 209 F.3d 1071, 1073 (8th Cir. 2000) \\n(reversing for plain error because the district court \\nfailed to instruct the jury  to award nominal damages \\nif it found a free-speech violation); Zok v. State , 903 \\nP.2d 574, 579 (Alaska 1995) (failure to award nominal \\ndamages for unlawful arrest was plain error because \\nthe \\u201cright to be free from unlawful confinement is sufficiently important and fundamental in our \\nsociety\\u201d). Indeed, circuit co urts uniformly hold that an \\naward of nominal damages is mandatory upon \\nproving a constitutional violation. Pet.Br.30\\u201331 n.4 \\n(collecting cases). The officials\\u2019 cramped theory of \\nnominal damages cannot explain away this history. \\nD. Nominal damages are not a mere \\nanalogue for declaratory relief. \\nNominal damages\\u2019 primary purpose is to redress \\na past injury. Yet the officials continue to assert that \\n\\u201c[d]eclaratory judgments are the analogue,\\u201d \\nResp.Br.41, unless sovereign or qualified immunity is at stake, in which case th e officials feel differently, id. \\nat 42 n.3. The officials are incorrect. U.S.Br.23\\u201327. \\nTo be sure, \\u201call judgments of courts declare jural \\nrelations.\\u201d Edwin M. Borchard, The Declaratory \\nJudgment\\u2014A Needed Procedural Reform , 28 Y\\nALE \\nL.J. 1, 4 (1918). Yet courts do not equate all forms of \\nrelief with declaratory judgments just because they share this one trait. \\n12 \\nNor do the officials rebut the many other differ-\\nences between declaratory judgments and nominal \\ndamages that unravel their flawed analogy. First, \\nnominal damages are legal relief, while declaratory judgments are equitable. Resp.Br.42 n.3. Second, \\ndeclaratory judgments were designed to determine \\nlegal rights \\u201c before breach .\\u201d Edwin M. Borchard, The \\nUniform Act on Declaratory Judgments , 34 H\\nARV. L. \\nREV. 697, 707 (1921). Nominal damages remedy past \\nharm, unavailable until an injury has occurred. C\\nHARLES T. MCCORMICK , HANDBOOK ON THE LAW OF \\nDAMAGES  \\u00a7 20 at 85 (1935) (\\u201cNominal damages are \\nawarded for the infraction of a legal right.\\u201d). \\nThird, declaratory judgments are primarily \\nprospective relief, Christian Legal Soc\\u2019y v. Martinez , \\n561 U.S. 661, 676 n.6 (2010), while nominal damages, \\nwhich require a past violation, are primarily retro-\\nspective, Arizonans for Official English , 520 U.S. at \\n69 & n.24.   Fourth, the Declaratory Judgment Act \\n\\u201cconfers a discretion  on the courts,\\u201d not an \\u201cabsolute \\nright upon the litigant.\\u201d Wilton v. Seven Falls Co. , 515 \\nU.S. 277, 287 (1995). Nominal damages are manda-tory. Farrar , 506 U.S. at 112 (\\u201c Carey obligate[d] a \\ncourt to award nominal damages when a plaintiff \\nestablishes the violation of his right\\u201d). And finally, \\nunlike declaratory judgments,  courts have held that \\nnominal damages are subject to sovereign- and \\nqualified-immunity defenses. E.g., Am. Civil Liberties \\nUnion v. U.S. Conf. of Cath. Bishops , 705 F.3d 44, 53 \\nn.7 (1st Cir. 2013) (sovereign immunity); Hopkins v. \\nSaunders , 199 F.3d 968, 978 (8th Cir. 1999) (qualified \\nimmunity). \\nIn sum, the disparities between declaratory judg-\\nments and nominal damages are stark. And rightly \\nso, as their primary purpose is decidedly different. \\n13 \\nE. The officials\\u2019 view of nominal damages \\ncontradicts Article III requirements. \\nRationalizing some of the many instances in \\nwhich common-law courts awarded nominal damages \\nfor the past violation of rights, the officials argue that \\nthe \\u201cjurisdictional hook\\u201d is \\u201cthe plaintiff\\u2019s live claim \\nfor compensatory damages.\\u201d Resp.Br.26. This hook saves a nominal-damages claim from mootness, say \\nthe officials, even if the plaintiff\\u2019s compensatory-\\ndamages claim fail s on the merits. Ibid.  That \\nreasoning cannot be right. \\nTo begin, \\u201ca plaintiff must demonstrate standing \\nfor each claim he seeks to press and for each form of relief that is sought.\\u201d Town of Chester v. Laroe Ests., \\nInc., 137 S. Ct. 1645, 1650 (2017) (citation omitted). It \\nis impossible for a compensatory-damage remedy to \\nbe a \\u201cjurisdictional hook\\u201d for a separate, moot remedy. \\nA nominal-damages remedy mu st (and does) stand on \\nits own merits from the case\\u2019s inception. \\nIn addition, \\u201can actual controversy must be extant \\nat all stages of review, not merely at the time the com-\\nplaint is filed.\\u201d Arizonans for Official English , 520 \\nU.S. at 67 (citation omitted). Once a plausible claim \\nfor compensatory damages fail s at the merits stage, it \\nis again impossible for that claim to be a \\u201cjurisdictional hook\\u201d for a separate, moot claim. \\nMoreover, a plaintiff must quantify injury to \\nclaim compensatory damage s. Yet the loss of First \\nAmendment freedoms like speech and religious \\nexercise constitutes \\u201cirreparable injury.\\u201d Roman \\nCatholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , __ S. Ct. __, \\n2020 WL 6948354, at *3 (Nov. 25, 2020). Such injury \\n\\u201ccannot be adequately measured or compensated by \\nmoney.\\u201d Irreparable Injury , B\\nLACK \\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY  \\n14 \\n(11th ed. 2019). The officials\\u2019 position would lead to \\nthe indefensible result that the appropriate remedy \\nfor a past violation of rights is one that in some cases \\nwill not be available. \\nFinally, the officials\\u2019 position deprives some \\nvictims of government misconduct of any remedy. The \\nofficials say that without plausible compensatory-damages remedies, plaintiffs can still \\u201cvindicate their \\nrights through claims for prospective relief like \\ninjunctions and declaratory judgments.\\u201d Resp.Br.46\\u201348. But that only underscor es the correctness of Chike \\nand Joseph\\u2019s position: that eliminating the nominal-\\ndamages remedy would allo w officials to make a \\nstrategic post-filing change in policy solely to moot \\nprospective relief. Such a risk is real because \\ngovernment officials have strong incentives to moot \\ncases. Becket Fund Br. 8\\u201314; Joseph C. Davis & \\nNicholas R. Reaves, The Point Isn\\u2019t Moot: How Lower \\nCourts Have Blessed Go vernment Abuse of the \\nVoluntary-Cessation Doctrine , 129 Y\\nALE L.J.  FORUM  \\n325 (2019). The officials propose a phantom remedy to \\ninsulate their unconstitutional acts from legal accountability. \\n  \\n15 \\nII. The officials\\u2019 reasons for creating a nominal-\\ndamages exception to Article III are indefensible. \\nThe officials predict dire  effects if this Court \\nallows partial redress for the violation of Chike and \\nJoseph\\u2019s rights. Yet it ha s been \\u201cwidely recognized\\u201d \\nfor ages \\u201cthat a claim for nominal damages precludes mootness\\u201d based on later events. N.Y. State Rifle & \\nPistol Ass\\u2019n v. City of N.Y. , 140 S. Ct. 1525, 1536 \\n(2020) (Alito, J., dissenting); Pet.Br.14 n.2 (catalog-uing eight circuits\\u2019 rule). None of these asserted \\nconsequences have material ized in the jurisdictions \\nthat have rejected the Eleventh Circuit\\u2019s novel and indefensible approach. The officials\\u2019 arguments lack \\nmerit. \\nA. The majority rule does not require \\nadvisory opinions. \\nThe officials say that nominal-damages claims \\ninvite advisory opinions. Resp.Br. 2, 9\\u201310, 22, 41\\u201342. Not so. To quote the officials\\u2019 own cases, advisory opinions \\u201cadvis[e] what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\\u201d Aetna Life Ins. Co. of \\nHartford v. Haworth , 300 U.S. 227, 241 (1937). \\nAccord, e.g., Preiser v. Newkirk , 422 U.S. 395, 401 \\n(1975) (same);  Ashcroft v. Mattis , 431 U.S. 171, 172 \\n(1977) (per curiam). That\\u2019s not the request here. \\nChike and Joseph present real-world facts and \\n\\u201cconcrete legal issues, presented in [an] actual case[  ],\\u201d \\nGolden v. Zwickler , 394 U.S. 103, 108 (1969): whether \\nofficials violated their free -speech rights. It is not \\nclear why the officials believe that question is more hypothetical here than if Chike\\u2019s speech had con-sumed 1\\u00a2 of chalk, particularly when the officials do \\n16 \\nnot contest he suffered a cognizable injury-in-fact. \\nThere is nothing advisory about deciding the question \\nand awarding nominal damages. Young Ams. for \\nLiberty Br. 12; Christia n Legal Soc\\u2019y Br. 5\\u20136. \\nB. The majority rule does not eliminate the \\nmootness doctrine. \\nThe longstanding majority rule has not \\u201cswal-\\nlowed\\u201d the mootness doctrine in the eight circuits that \\nfollow it. Contra Resp.Br.43\\u201345. Many constitutional \\ncases seek only prospectiv e relief, either because \\ndamages are barred by sovereign immunity or because the injury is threatened or imminent but has not yet occurred at the time of filing. The mootness doctrine is alive and well for those cases. The \\nsituation here\\u2014where the officials already violated \\nChike\\u2019s and Joseph\\u2019s constitutional rights\\u2014presents \\nthe flip side of mootness: fed eral courts are obligated \\nto adjudicate live controversies. Knox v. Serv. Emps. \\nInt\\u2019l Union, Local 1000 , 567 U.S. 298, 307\\u201308 (2012). \\nPlus, the officials\\u2019 concer n for the vitality of the \\nmootness doctrine is selective. They concede that the \\ndoctrine has not crumbled ev en though a plaintiff can \\navoid mootness by seeking compensation for negli-gible financial damages. Resp.Br.49. So, it will not disintegrate if a plaintiff seeks justice without putting \\nhimself and the courts through the trouble and \\ndisproportionate expense of monetizing, proving, and \\nassessing those injuries, as long experience in the courts of appeals attests. Ar ticle III does not require \\nplaintiffs to repackage no minal-damages claims as \\nsmall damages claims. Both types of claims ensure a \\nlive controversy. \\n17 \\nFar more troublesome problems arise under the \\nofficials\\u2019 rule, which allows governments to moot \\ncases unilaterally and strategically. That approach \\nallows officials to reinstate unconstitutional policies, a phenomenon that the amici have well documented. \\nFIRE Br. 24\\u201327; Becket Fund Br. 10\\u201314; Just. & Free-\\ndom Fund Br. 9, 15\\u201316 & n.4. It creates incentives for officials to run out the clock on many claims, e.g., \\ndelaying until students gr aduate, or prisoners get \\ntransferred. Islam & Religious Freedom Br. 14\\u201315; Inst. for Free Speech Br. 14\\u20131 5; Becket Fund Br. 23\\u2013\\n25; Christian Legal Soc\\u2019y Br. 15\\u201317; FIRE Br. 5\\u20137. \\nIn short, the officials\\u2019 mootness-related policy \\nconcerns do not justify their invitation to jettison the \\nmajority rule and create a nominal-damages excep-\\ntion to Article III. \\nC. The majority rule neither wastes judicial \\nresources nor prolongs cases.  \\nThe officials and their amici say that the enduring \\nmajority rule wastes judicial resources, prolongs \\nlawsuits, and increases attorney fees. Resp.Br.45; \\nD.C.Br. 13\\u201321. But government officials who quickly and \\u201creasonably respond\\u201d when initially alerted to an unconstitutional policy, D.C.Br. 4\\u201311, rarely face protracted litigation. \\nConsider what happened here. Three years before \\nChike tried to speak on campus\\u2014in 2013 \\u2014counsel \\ninformed Georgia Gwinnett officials that their poli-cies were unconstitutional. Pet.App.89a\\u201390a. The of-ficials did nothing. Chike questioned the overbreadth and inconsistency of the officia ls\\u2019 policies when he was \\nordered to stop speaking in 2016. Id. at 100a\\u201302a. \\nAgain, officials did nothing. When Chike filed suit in \\n18 \\nDecember 2016, the officials did not recant; they dou-\\nbled down, insisting that sharing the Christian faith \\n\\u201carguably rose to the level of \\u2018fighting words\\u2019\\u201d that the \\nFirst Amendment does not protect. Id. at 155a. \\nIt was not until much later in the case that the \\nofficials changed their unconstitutional policies and then promptly moved to dismiss. Id. at 160a. Imagine \\nhow much litigation and how many constitutional \\ndeprivations the officials could have avoided simply \\nby \\u201creasonably responding\\u201d in 2013. \\nThe reality is officials oft en stubbornly refuse to \\nconcede that they have vi olated someone\\u2019s constitu-\\ntional rights. E.g., N.Y. State Rifle & Pistol Ass\\u2019n , 140 \\nS. Ct. at 1538\\u201339 (Alito, J., dissenting) (city fought the \\nplaintiffs\\u2019 Second Amendment rights \\u201ctooth and nail\\u201d \\nin lower courts, then strategically changed policy to \\n\\u201cmoot\\u201d the case on the eve of oral argument in this Court). The amici briefs are replete with such examples. E.g., Becket Fund Br. 3 (prison changed \\npolicy \\u201c[t]wo weeks before oral argument\\u201d); \\nCatholicVote.org Br. 12 n.4 (city repealed ordinance \\n\\u201cyears into litigation\\u201d an d \\u201cdays\\u201d after grant of en \\nbanc review); Pacific Legal Found. Br. 1\\u20132 (city repealed ban \\u201c[o]n the eve of oral argument\\u201d); FIRE Br. 7 (universities \\u201cdisavow[  ]\\u201d policies \\u201cafter the \\nstart of litigation\\u201d). And though the District of \\nColumbia amici say the Eleventh Circuit\\u2019s rule \\n\\u201cincentivizes government actors to revisit challenged laws,\\u201d the brief\\u2019s listed examples all come from outside the Eleventh Circuit. D.C.Br. 4\\u201311. Indeed, the officials here changed their policies several months before  the Eleventh Circuit adopted its outlier \\nrule, further proving that the majority rule already \\nencourages officials to do the right thing. \\n19 \\nConversely, the longstanding rule does not \\nencourage plaintiffs to pursue pointless litigation \\nsimply to inflict an attorn ey-fee award. This \\u201cCourt\\u2019s \\ndecision not to grant fees in Farrar was born of its \\nreluctance to reward attorneys for bringing less than \\nmeritorious claims that see k, but fail to obtain, large \\nmonetary judgments or fail to promote a larger public good.\\u201d Project Vote/Voting for Am., Inc.  v. Dickerson , \\n444 F. App\\u2019x 660, 664 (4th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) \\n(citing Farrar , 506 U.S. at 116). The same will be true \\nin cases brought simply to harass. But a meritorious \\ncivil-rights claim brought to stop unconstitutional government conduct \\u201cis the very form of litigation Congress wished to encourage by enacting \\u00a7  1988.\\u201d \\nIbid.  (citing Daly v. Hill, 790 F.2d 1071, 1084 (4th Cir. \\n1986)). Accord, e.g., Fox v. Vice, 563 U.S. 826, 832\\u201333 \\n(2011) (characterizing a successful \\u00a7 1983 plaintiff pursuing \\u00a7 1988 fees as \\u201ca private attorney general\\u201d) (citation omitted). \\u201cDeterring meritorious lawsuits on constitutional issues because they offer a small \\nlikelihood of a significant money judgment presents \\nas grave a danger to our legal system as frivolous litigation.\\u201d Project Vote , F.

Br. 7\\u201312 (discussing implications of tactical \\nmooting).  \\nIt\\u2019s not even clear that following the majority rule \\nwould appreciably increase caseloads. The officials \\nhave provided no evidence that the circuits applying \\nthe majority rule have been overwhelmed with nominal-damages cases. Contra Inst. for Free Speech \\nBr. 16\\u201317 n.11 (statistics showing the opposite). In \\nthe long run, reaching the merits conserves judicial \\n20 \\nresources by produc ing precedent that obviates future \\ndisputes\\u2014sometimes on precisely the same issue,  \\nwhere unconstitutional policies are reinstated after a \\ncase has been strategically mooted. Id. at 17; The \\nPoint Isn\\u2019t Moot , 129 Y ALE L.J.  FORUM  at 338\\u201341. \\nFinally, the most effective way to minimize \\nconstitutional violations is to hold recalcitrant officials accountable, not to deny victims the remedy \\nArticle III allows. Just. & Freedom Fund Br. 17\\u201318; \\ncontra Br. of Nat\\u2019l Conf. of State Legislatures 23\\u201324. When, as here, a prospective plaintiff sends government officials a warning letter, alerting them to unconstitutional conduct, the potential negative consequences of a future judgment, see Br. of Nat\\u2019l \\nConf. of State Legislatures 23\\u201324, are precisely what \\nmotivate the officials to change course. Officials who \\nknow they can violate constitutional rights without cost have no incentive to stop violating the Constitution. \\nIn sum, allowing the gove rnment to unilaterally \\nmoot claims for past consti tutional violations would \\nundermine the vindication of constitutional rights \\nand the Constitution itself. After all, courts are the \\u201cdepartment of the government to whom the protection of the rights of the individual is by the \\nconstitution especially confided.\\u201d 1\\n ST. GEORGE \\nTUCKER , BLACKSTONE \\u2019S COMMENTARIES , App. 357 \\n(1803). Prohibiting the government from doing so would not change the prevailing legal landscape. \\n  \\n21 \\nIII. The officials\\u2019 rule would leave plaintiffs \\nwithout a remedy and result in more violations of constitutional rights.  \\nAbandoning the majority rule would leave some \\nvictims of constitutional violations without a remedy. \\nEquitable relief is often unavailable or easily mooted \\n(as shown here), and constitutional violations often do not cause quantifiable harm. Pet.Br.37; FIRE Br. 5\\u20139. The officials fail to meaningfully engage these points. \\nThe officials first insist that these claims \\u201ccan \\noften be adjudicated\\u201d via \\u201cprospective relief.\\u201d \\nResp.Br.46. But \\u201ccan often\\u201d means \\u201cnot always,\\u201d since such relief is available only when the illegal conduct \\u201cmight happen again.\\u201d Ibid. Those mistreated under \\na later-repealed policy or  subjected to \\u201cone-off\\u201d \\nviolations have no such reme dy. This gives officials at \\nleast one \\u201cfree pass\\u201d to violate the Constitution.   \\nSuch a rule also artificia lly constricts the judici-\\nary\\u2019s ability and duty to protect individual rights \\nbased on an unsupported as surance that officials will \\nuse this leeway altruistic ally and correct mistakes \\nquickly. Perhaps the offic ials\\u2019 suggested approach \\nwould work if we were governed by angels rather than \\nmere \\u201cmen.\\u201d T\\nHE FEDERALIST NO. 51, at 322 (James \\nMadison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961). But amici \\nrecount myriad experiences demonstrating that the judiciary serves as an important check-and-balance. \\nWorse, civil-rights litigants already face daunting \\nterrain:  persuading attorn eys to pro bono represent \\nthem, exhausting administrative remedies, and surviving immunity, which shields all but those who \\ndefy clearly established law. And at least six circuits \\n22 \\nhave even lowered the burden on officials to show a \\ncase is moot. The Point Isn\\u2019t Moot , 129 Y ALE L.J.  \\nFORUM  at 333, n.50. The Eleventh Circuit, like others, \\ngives government officials \\u201cconsiderably more leeway \\nthan private parties in the presumption that they are \\nunlikely to resume illegal activities.\\u201d Coral Springs \\nSt. Sys., Inc.  v. City of Sunrise , 371 F.3d 1320, 1328\\u2013\\n29 (11th Cir. 2004). \\nThis flipped burden forces plaintiffs to prove\\u2014\\nusually with no discovery\\u2014that officials will revert to \\nthe original policy. Yet officials are \\u201cmore likely to strategically moot cases, not less\\u201d than private defendants. The Point Isn\\u2019t Moot , 129 Y\\nALE L.J.  \\nFORUM  at 335. Accord Becket Fund Br. 8\\u201314; FIRE \\nBr. 24\\u201328; CAIR Br. 15\\u201317. \\nFor \\u201cone-off\\u201d violations, the officials insist the \\nremedy is compensation. Resp.Br.49\\u201352. But again, this helps only those who ha ve suffered quantifiable \\nharm. And examples abound of constitutional injuries \\nthat often are not compens able, including unlawful \\nentry of private residences, denial of kosher meals in \\nprison, zoning restrictions on religious institutions, door-to-door proselytizin g restrictions, and free \\nspeech claims on campus\\u2014all examples that would transform difficulty pr oving damages into a \\njurisdictional bar. Hudson  v. Michigan , 547 U.S. 586, \\n610 (2006) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (\\u201cthe majority, like \\nMichigan and the United States, has failed to cite a single reported case in which a plaintiff has collected more than nominal damages solely as a result of a knock-and-announce violation\\u201d); Just. & Freedom Fund Br. 5 n.2; CatholicVote .org Br. 16; ACLU Br. \\n17\\u201318; Islam & Religious Freedom Br. 8\\u20139; Becket \\nFund Br. 20\\u201325; Seventh- Day Adventists Br. 20. \\n23 \\nPlus, some religiously motivated plaintiffs only \\nwant justice or are reluctant to seek money damages \\nfor theological reasons. It\\u2019s a perverse incentive to \\nforce  such plaintiffs to demand compensatory \\ndamages they do not want or need. \\nNor are compensatory damages for intangible \\ninjuries a cure-all. Many circuits require plaintiffs to prove those injuries without relying on their \\nsubjective testimony, and statutes and immunities \\nimpose more hurdles. Becket Fund Br. 15\\u201318. In these and other civil rights ca ses, plaintiffs steer clear \\nof compensatory damages because \\u201ccausation and quantification of damages are burdensome to litigate,\\u201d \\u201cthere is little prospect of substantial \\nrecovery,\\u201d and these clai ms \\u201cprofoundly irritate[  ] the \\njudge.\\u201d Douglas Laycock, The Triumph of Equity , 56 \\nL.\\n & CONTEMP . PROBS . 53, 63 (1993). Discarding the \\nmajority rule on nominal damages leaves no remedy for those plaintiffs who do not have monetizable harm, rendering their rights unenforceable and \\neffectively nonexistent. \\nIf the Court creates an artificial jurisdictional bar \\nthat renders rights unenforceable in certain circum-stances, it is not difficult to predict that more viola-\\ntions of constitutional rights will follow. As this Court \\nhas already recognized, nominal-damages awards \\nensure that constitutional  rights are \\u201cscrupulously \\nobserved.\\u201d Carey , 435 U.S. at 266. Excluding such \\nawards from Article III would guarantee the opposite outcome. Although this problem extends to many backdrops, the context presented here\\u2014free speech on public college and university campuses\\u2014provides \\na stark illustration. \\n24 \\nNearly 90% of public, postsecondary institutions \\nmaintain policies that severely restrict protected \\nspeech or could be applied to do so. FIRE Br. 14\\u201323. \\nMany of these policies ar e vague and overbroad, \\nincluding granting officials unfettered discretion to \\nsilence and punish, or prohibiting offensive expres-\\nsion based on third-party perceptions ( i.e., heckler \\nvetoes). \\nGiven that evidence, there is a real risk that a \\nnew rule disallowing standalone nominal-damages claims would lead university officials to strategically moot controversies after  a student\\u2019s rights are \\nviolated. Doubling down on constitutional depriva-tions would inevitably extend off campus to other \\ngovernment officials, endangering not just free speech \\nand religious exercise, but also Second Amendment \\nrights, the right to be free from illegal searches, unlawful detentions, and many others. \\nA constitutional right that cannot be enforced is \\nno right at all.

The late Howard Jarvis, founder of \\nHJTA, utilized the People of  California\\u2019s reserved \\npower of initiative to sponsor California\\u2019s well-known Proposition 13 in 1978. Proposition 13 was overwhelm-\\ningly approved by California voters and added Article \\nXIII A to the California Constitution. Proposition 13 has kept thousands of fixed income Californians secure \\nin their ability to stay in their own homes by limiting \\nthe ad valorem property tax rate and annual escala-tion of property taxes.\\n1 \\n HJTA has a central and ongoing interest in pro-\\ntecting homeowners\\u2019 rights to retain their homes. In \\nthe unfortunate circumstance of financial distress \\nleading to unpaid property taxes and government fore-closure, HJTA continues to  advocate for homeowners \\nbeing able to receive the remaining equity that right-\\nfully belongs to them and, in  all likelihood, will be their \\nsole economic resource for their next stage of life. \\nHJTA has recently supported legislation to that effect \\nin California and written on this vital current topic known as home equity thef t. (Jon Coupal & Joshua \\n \\n 1 Per Rule 37, the parties were notified and consented to the \\nfiling of this brief more than ten days before its filing. See Sup. \\nCt. R. 37.2(a). Blanket consent from Petitioner was also filed Sep-tember 9, 2022. No party\\u2019s counsel authored any of this brief; ami-\\ncus alone funded its preparation and submission. See Sup. Ct. R. \\n37.6. \\n \\n2 \\n Polk, Stop home equity theft by the state of California , \\nThe Orange County Register (Mar. 27, 2022).2) \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\n The Minnesota statutes at issue violate the Fifth \\nAmendment Takings Clause and the Eighth Amend-\\nment Excessive Fines Clause. They do so by expressly taking home equity for public use without just compen-\\nsation. They also take the owner\\u2019s equity as excessive \\npunishment for non-payment of taxes, even though in-terest and penalties have already been charged. There \\nis no reason for Ms. Tyler to pay her government a pre-\\nmium of $25,000 on top of the $15,000 she owed, which \\nalready included interest and penalties. \\n \\u201cPublic use\\u201d is clear. The Minnesota statute that \\ndistributed Ms. Tyler\\u2019s $25,000 in home equity is titled \\n\\u201cAPPORTIONMENT OF PROCEEDS TO TAXING \\nDISTRICTS.\\u201d (Minn. Stat., \\u00a7 282.08.) The more subtle variety of home equity thef t in California also admits \\n\\u201cpublic use\\u201d in statute. (Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7 3695.4.) \\n Amicus writes separately to highlight the subtle \\nforms of home equity theft that will likely expand with-\\nout a grant of certiorari in this case. California, men-tioned just briefly in the Petition for Certiorari, is \\nplagued by home equity theft as well, and in dangerous \\n \\n 2 https://www.ocregister.com/2022/03/27/stop-home-equity- \\ntheft-by-the-state -of-california/. \\n3 \\n ways that will fly under the radar without enforcement \\nof the Constitution for Ms. Tyler. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nARGUMENT \\nI. Certiorari should be granted because gov-\\nernment, under the Fifth and Eighth \\nAmendments, must respect, not exploit, vulnerable homeowners. \\nA. No one, includin g government, may ex-\\nploit a tax windfall. \\n Governments do not allow taxpayers to take tax \\nwindfalls. (See Handlery Hotels, Inc. v. Franchise Tax \\nBd. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1360; Franck v. Polaris E-Z \\nGo Div. of Textron  (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 1107.) Gov-\\nernments must likewise not be allowed to take tax \\nwindfalls. As Justice Holmes famously wrote, \\u201c[m]en \\nmust turn square corners wh en they deal with the \\nGovernment.\\u201d ( Rock Island, A. & L. R. Co. v. United \\nStates  (1920) 254 U.S. 141, 143.) Likewise, particularly \\nwhen so much is at stake, \\u201c[ i]t is no less good morals \\nand good law that the Gove rnment should turn square \\ncorners in dealing with the people than that the people \\nshould turn square corners in dealing with their Gov-ernment.\\u201d ( St. Regis Paper Co. v. United States  (1961) \\n368 U.S. 208, 229.) Accordingly, governments should \\nnot be trespassers, but trustees, particularly to trag-edy-befallen persons, such as Ms. Tyler, who happen to \\nown a home or other real pro perty that can be levied to \\nsatisfy a tax debt. \\n4 \\n  In this case, as in certain related instances in Cal-\\nifornia, a vulnerable member of society was exploited \\nby her government following a tax sale of her property \\nto cover a delinquency. The Eighth Circuit seems to sanction this as punishment for a distressed home-\\nowner\\u2019s normal human weaknesses when it writes: \\n\\u201cOnly after [Ms. Tyler] declined to avail herself of these opportunities did \\u2018abs olute title\\u2019 pass to the \\nState.\\u201d ( Tyler v. Hennepin Cty.  (8th Cir. 2022) 26 F.4th \\n789, 793.) Thus, while the pri mary issue seems to be \\nwhether the retention of Ms. Tyler\\u2019s $25,000 home eq-\\nuity is a taking under the Fifth Amendment because it \\nwas her property, the Eighth Amendment\\u2019s Excessive Fines Clause is at issue as well. (U.S. Const. amend. V; \\namend. XIV, amend. VIII.) The taking of home equity \\nis clearly intended as a p unishment for nonpayment of \\ntaxes and inability to redeem the debt. As aging and \\nmental health issues are only increasing in America, it \\nis a vital question for all whether seizing the value of the whole property for the repayment of a lesser debt \\nis an excessive and abusive use of government power. \\n Homeownership is a precious goal that many \\nAmericans work hard to achieve. Faulting homeowners \\nfor not heeding warnings to redeem their debts through payment plans or re-purchase disrespectfully \\nignores many distressed homeowners\\u2019 reality. Such \\nhomeowners often come to this position due to age, medical condition, loss of eyesight or other physical \\ndisability, mental impairment, the negligence of a care-\\ngiver, dishonesty of a relative, or simple lack of func-tional support. (Brief of Amicus Curiae AARP and \\n5 \\n AARP Foundation, March 30, 2021, Case No. 20-3730, \\nat pp. 7-8; Johnson v. City of East Orange, N.J. Sup. \\nCourt for Essex County , No. ESX-L-009175-21  [illness \\nof responsible family member]; Hetelekides v. County of \\nOntario (2021) 147 N.Y.S.3d 811  [death of taxpayer]; \\nFoss v. City of New Bedford, Mass. Sup. Court for Bris-\\ntol County , No. 2273CV00243  [disabled retiree suffer-\\ning medical and financial problems].) There are also \\ncases of small, innocently miscalculated underpay-\\nments that turn into nightmares for homeowners and taxpayers alike. ( Perez v. County of Wayne, Mich. Cir. \\nCourt for County of Wayne , No. 19-009286-CZ  [$144 tax \\ndebt; county kept all $108,000 sales proceeds, 750 times the original debt]; Rafaeli, LLC v. Oakland \\nCounty (2020) 505 Mich. 429 [$8. 41 tax debt; county \\nkept all $24,500 sales proceeds, approximately 2,913 times the original debt].) Homeowners suffering from \\ndistress or mistake should not be disproportionally \\npunished by a total loss of  home equity\\u2014perhaps the \\nonly economic resource they have accrued\\u2014but should \\nbe provided a check for the remainder of what they \\nonce rightfully owned. It is a simple calculation and function of government to process such an incredible \\noverpayment. \\n Minnesota\\u2019s tax windfall here is approximately \\n$25,000 in \\u201cnet proceeds\\u201d from  the sale of Ms. Tyler\\u2019s \\ncondominium to satisfy he r delinquent property tax \\nbill. ( Tyler v. Hennepin Cty ., 26 F.4th at pp. 790-791.) \\nThe extensive current and hi storical legal support for \\nthese proceeds belonging to Ms. Tyler is well set out \\nin the Petition for Certiorari and will not be repeated \\n6 \\n here, except to concur that relevant takings jurispru-\\ndence directly applies. ( Koontz v. St. Johns River Water \\nManagement Dist . (2013) 570 U.S. 595; Webb\\u2019s Fabu-\\nlous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith  (1980) 449 U.S. 155.) \\n Minnesota\\u2019s tax windfall at Ms. Tyler\\u2019s expense \\nmust be reviewed. Amicus HJTA submits that the \\u201cvar-ious purposes\\u201d of Minnesota Statute section 282.08 \\n(Tyler v. Hennepin Cty ., 26 F.4th at p.  791) are clearly \\nthe same purposes for which taxes are imposed and collected. Accordingly, Minnesota has created a tax \\nloophole for its own benefit at a vulnerable home-\\nowner\\u2019s expense, a behavior that is repeated in many states as the Petition for Certiorari explains. Minne-\\nsota\\u2019s claim to Ms. Tyler\\u2019s $25,000 in home equity is \\neither a taking or an excessive punishment and any-thing else is fiction. Certior ari should be granted to \\nresolve the widespread problem afflicting American \\nhomeowners and the future of homeownership. \\n Even in states where the law recognizes a poten-\\ntial return of excess home equity, there is opportunity for government to under-prioritize the noticing proce-\\ndures and thereby increase the likelihood of taxing \\nauthorities quietly, passively retaining the funds that rightfully belong to the taxpayer. For example, in Cali-\\nfornia, proceeds are not automatically delivered, but \\nmust be claimed within one year. (Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7 4675(a).) Government bureaucracy can be slow or in-\\nefficient enough for notices to be misplaced or sent to \\nthe wrong address in that short time. Even when no-tices timely arrive at the right address, distressed for-\\nmer homeowners may\\u2014conveniently for California \\n7 \\n governments\\u2014not be in sufficient physical or mental \\ncondition to file a claim nor have the aid of someone \\nwho can. After one year with no claim filed, the prop-\\nerty belongs to the State of California, as it is in Min-\\nnesota. Clarity in this case would help California and \\nother states to clean up th eir tax collection laws to \\ncomport with the U.S. Constitution as it regards what is typically an American\\u2019s most vital asset and symbol \\nof financial stability and prosperity: a home. \\n \\nB. Minnesota\\u2019s tax windfall for county-\\nsupervised forest management, parks, \\nand general government services is de-\\nfinitively for \\u201cpublic use\\u201d and punishes Ms. Tyler for a lack of funds by taking significantly more than was owed. \\n Minnesota Statute section 282.08 would apportion \\nthe $25,000 \\u201cnet proceeds\\u201d of the Tyler tax sale to for-\\nest development, county parks and recreation, and un-restricted general government services. In fact, section \\n282.08 is titled \\u201c APPORTIONMENT OF PROCEEDS \\nTO TAXING DISTRICTS .\\u201d It is indisputable that \\nmoney transferred to a taxing district is for \\u201cpublic \\nuse\\u201d under the Fifth Amendment. That is the only pur-\\npose of such districts. \\n Ms. Tyler\\u2019s private property has been taken for \\n$25,000 worth of such public use, and similar incidents regularly occur across the country. Without review, \\ngovernments will continue to take tax windfalls out-\\nright, as Minnesota does by statute, or make room in \\n8 \\n statutes for clever designs or carelessness similarly ca-\\npable of producing unjustified windfalls at the expense \\nof the vulnerable. \\n Ms. Tyler did not have the money or the financial \\nsavvy to redeem the property , so the foreclosure pro-\\nceedings ensued. HJTA does not debate this. HJTA as-serts that Ms. Tyler\\u2019s prope rty has been taken and she \\nhas been excessively punished for having no money or \\nability to redeem the property, a state of being that is \\nnot even a disobedient act, much less a crime. Never-\\ntheless she has been fined, and the amount of her fine \\nis undoubtedly extreme. With the $40,000 sale of her home, Ms. Tyler paid her $15,000 debt (inclusive of ex-\\nisting penalties and interest) nearly 3 times. Given the \\neveryday prevalence of homeownership, hardship, and government use of tax sales on real property to satisfy \\ndebt, the Court should grant certiorari to make clear \\nin all states what is th e minimum standard under the \\nTakings Clause and/or whether this is an impermissi-\\nble, excessive punishment for unpaid taxes. \\n \\nII. The California Le gislature maintains a \\nvariant of the problem, also taking prop-\\nerty for \\u201cpublic use,\\u201d and demonstrates no \\ninclination to correct it. \\n Although California is not part of the extensive \\nsplit of authority among states on the parallel issue to \\nMs. Tyler\\u2019s, which immediately  speaks volumes as to \\nthe need for certiorari, California\\u2019s tax sales statutes demonstrate a more subtle abuse of homeowners. As \\n9 \\n the Petition for Certiorari briefly explained, \\u201c[Califor-\\nnia] law permits confiscation of the entire value when \\nmunicipalities claim the indebted property for a public \\nuse or economic revitalization.\\u201d (Pet. at 31.) Without clarification on certiorari, California\\u2019s laws taking \\nhome equity from vulnerable citizens will continue to \\nwreak havoc unchecked. \\n In California, a tax-defaulting homeowner gener-\\nally has one year to claim remaining home equity from a tax sale like the one Ms. Tyler\\u2019s property underwent. \\n(Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7 4675(a).) When property is \\nsold at a tax auction, and a claim is filed, disbursement \\nof the excess funds proceeds as follows: \\n(A) First, to lienholders of record prior to the \\nrecordation of the tax deed to the purchaser in \\nthe order of their priority. \\n(B) Second, to any person with title of record \\nto all or any portion of the property prior to \\nthe recordation of the tax deed to the pur-chaser. \\n(Id. at 4675(e).) \\n Though far from perfect, this provision comports \\nmore with the Constitution than does the Minnesota law in this case. \\n But there is another Ca lifornia law which causes \\nhome equity theft like Minnesota\\u2019s. Working with a \\nnonprofit organization, the st ate or a local government \\nmay file an \\u201cobjection\\u201d with the county tax collector to stop the open-market sa le under section 4675 and \\n10 \\n redirect the sale to exclus ive no-bid proceedings un-\\nder another statutory scheme. (Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\n\\u00a7 3695.4.) The state or local government may do this \\nfor \\u201cany property that is or may be needed for public use.\\u201d ( Ibid.) A nonprofit organization may also file an \\n\\u201cobjection\\u201d on its own to trigger such special proceed-\\nings by providing a written promise to sell or rent to low-income persons. (Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7 3695.5.) \\nIn these cases, not only are no proceeds returned to the \\nhomeowner, but the homeowner will not be able to claim their remaining home equity as they could have \\nwithin one year under section 4675 because it will be \\ntaken by design. Their remaining home equity is taken for \\u201cpublic use\\u201d by government, developers or nonprof-\\nits. (Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7 3695.4.) \\n This special procedure is known as a Chapter 8 \\nsale. (See Cal Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7\\u00a7 3771-3841.) The non-\\nprofit organization or government-partnered developer gains an exclusive agreement to purchase the property \\nfor just the total amount due to the government. ( Id. at \\n\\u00a7\\u00a7 3791.4; 3793.1.) This absorbs  the home equity be-\\ncause it is not an open-market sale. And home equity \\ninterests, similar to Ms. Tyler\\u2019s, are taken for \\u201cpublic \\nuse\\u201d thereby. (Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7 3695.4.) This clearly demands Fifth Amendment review. \\n California legislators, however, are unmotivated to \\nbring these statutes into compliance with the Takings \\nClause or Excessive Fines Clause. On February 7, 2022, \\nAssembly Bill 1839 was introduced. AB1839 would have required that an open public auction occur before \\nany Chapter 8 sale, thus at minimum affording every \\n11 \\n defaulted homeowner one chance to recover their re-\\nmaining home equity. The California Association of \\nCounty Treasurers and Tax Collectors supported the \\nbill, and no one opposed. (Assem. Com. On Rev. and Tax., Analysis of Assem. Bill. No. 1839 (2021-2022 Reg. \\nSess.) as amended Mar. 22, 202 2, at p. 3, Hearing Date \\nApril 25, 2022.) \\n Unfortunately, AB1839 died in committee on April \\n26, 2022. What is worse, other legislation had been simultaneously proposed to expand  the definition of \\nan eligible nonprofit under the Chapter 8 sales pro-\\nceedings, thus intending to make home equity theft more likely. (Assem. Com. on Rev. and Tax., Analysis \\nof Assem. Bill No. 2021 (2021-2022 Reg. Sess.) as \\namended April 7, 2022, at p. 1, Hearing Date April 25, 2022 [\\u201cExpands eligible uses for which a nonprofit or-\\nganization may object to a sale of tax-defaulted prop-\\nerty by public auction or sealed bid\\u201d].) California, along with Minnesota and the many other states discussed \\nin the Petition for Certiorari,  sorely need application of \\nthe Takings Clause and Excessive Fines Clause to re-turn home equity proceeds to distressed homeowners \\nfollowing the sales of their homes to repay tax debts. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nCONCLUSION \\n In all its forms, home equity theft violates the Tak-\\nings and Excessive Fines Clauses as a fictitious wind-fall to government or exclusive government-appointed \\nbidders. Without certiorari in Ms. Tyler\\u2019s case against \\n12 \\n Minnesota\\u2019s outright retention of her $25,000, states \\nlike California will slip further into patterns and prac-\\ntices violating the Fifth and Eighth Amendments as \\nto their most vulnerable citi zens. Certiorari should be \\ngranted. \\nDATED: September 21, 2022 \\nRespectfully submitted, \\nJONATHAN  M. C OUPAL  \\nTIMOTHY  A. B ITTLE  \\nLAURA  E.

This en-\\nsures arbitration achieves its basic purpose of \\nresol ving disputes efficie ntly, predictably, and at \\nminimal cost. In support of those goals, The Center \\nsubmits this brief in support of Petitioner Coin-\\nbase, Inc., arguing that the decision of the Ninth \\nCircuit countenancing the district court\\u2019s discretion \\nto deny a stay of litigat ion pending interlocutory \\nappeal should be reversed and its opinion vacated.  \\nINTRODUCTION AND  \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT  \\nAn interlocutory appeal under Section 16(a) of \\nthe Federal Arbi tration Act addresses  the thresh-\\nold question of arbitrability. This Court should hold \\nthat such an appeal divests the district court of ju-\\nrisdiction and requires a mandatory stay of all liti-\\ngation.  \\nArbitration and litigation are distinct mecha-\\nnisms of dis pute resolution. They  cannot coexist. \\nParties choose arbitration to avoid litigation. Once \\na party has been forced to litigate, this purpose is \\ndestroyed. The loud, resonating bell of litigation, \\nonce heard by all, cannot be un -rung.3 Its course \\n \\n 3 Levin v. Alms & Assocs., I nc., 634  F.3d 260, 265 (4th \\nCir. 2011).  \\n3 \\nand its ef fects remain even if an appellate court re-\\nverses. Parties who litigate will suffer the conse-\\nquences, whatever they may be.  \\nThe Ninth Circuit (along with the Second and \\nFifth Circuits) has adopted an untenable rule that \\nwill adversely impact the bargained -for rights of \\nmillion s of American businesses and individuals \\nwho are parties to arbitration agreements in many \\ndiverse industries and contexts. Since the 1990s, \\nthe use of arbitration clauses in consumer, em-\\nployment, and commercial contracts has increased .   \\nGiven the prolife ration of arbitration, the Ninth \\nCircuit\\u2019s holding goes far beyond affecting business \\ninterests. Recent scholarship explains an effort by \\nplaintiff -claimants and their sophisticated attor-\\nneys to seize upon arbitration provisions in com-\\nmonplace consumer agr eements. Those claimants \\nseek to \\u201cturn the tables\\u201d on business interests by \\nusing arbitration agreements to file mass arbitra-\\ntions strategically intended to overwhelm and dis-\\nrupt the operations of their opponents. Put simply, \\nthis issu e affects a significa nt number of U.S. peo-\\nple and businesses and is not unique to businesses.  \\nThere are valid reasons why parties prefer arbi-\\ntration. Like Petitioner Coinbase, Inc., a party who \\nbargains for arbitration may seek streamlined, \\nfaster procedur es; control (such as input on the de-\\ncisionmaker); limitations on invasive and costly  \\ninter -party, third -party, and expert discovery; add-\\ned protections for confidential information; less  \\nadversarial and more collaborative adjudications; \\n4 \\nand final resoluti ons without the risk of protracted \\nappeal.  \\nCivil lawsuits in federal court, by contrast, are \\nnot as predictable. Litigation comes with broad dis-\\ncovery and unpredictable delay. Positions are \\nstaked out early on as one side or the other scores \\nwins in pretri al motions and deposi tions held long \\nbefore trial. Cases are more easily won on technical \\nvictories. No one person has any final say about \\nhow a lawsuit will take its course. Any given law-\\nsuit has a life of its own, often experiencing a form \\nof self -propel led but uncontrolled mom entum.  \\nThere are ripple effects. These costs of litigation \\npersist even if an appeal is won and a case is trans-\\nferred to arbitration after a period of forced litiga-\\ntion. This includes direct costs such as attorney \\nfees, expert fees , and litigation expe nses. There are \\nalso indirect costs. Indirect costs include disposi-\\ntive changes to the probable substantive outcome \\nresulting from, for example, damning discovery dis-\\nclosures, dismissals for technicalities, and pretrial \\nrulings that ch ange the course, tone , and tenor of \\nthe case \\u2014all of which might not have happened in \\narbitration.  \\nThe minority position says these concerns beg \\nthe question. After all, a defendant who loses on \\nappeal had no right to arbitrate to begin with and \\nthat defen dant has already lost  once. If the appel-\\nlate court affirms, then the plaintiff will be preju-\\ndiced by having to wait. That may be. But a \\nplaintiff who is asked to hold tight \\u2014and to wait on-\\n5 \\nly for the time it takes to have an appeal decided \\u2014\\ndoes not suffer th e same risk of harm. Delay is not \\nlike the permanent, possibly irreparable harm as-\\nsociated with discovery, case dynamics, and party \\npositioning in civil litigation undertaken while a \\ncase is on appeal on the issue of arbitrability.  \\nA defendant seeking  an interlocutory appeal  \\nunder Section 16(a) of the FAA is asking for protec-\\ntion from the permanent and un -windable litiga-\\ntion process (which it argues it contracted to avoid) \\nduring the limited time when arbitrability is an \\nopen question. Such a defendan t is not asking to \\narbitrate the dispute in the face of a loss, while on \\nappeal. Delay alone does not outweigh the pre-\\nsumptive prejudice to the party seeking to enforce \\narbitration. Where the very function of arbitration \\nis to avoid litigation and where th e issue on appeal \\nis whether litigation can proceed, the defendant \\nshould not have to bear the burden and costs of lit-\\nigation before that question is finally determined.  \\nThis conclusion is buttressed by the differences \\nin reversal rates between appeals fr om denials of \\narbitration as compared to appeals in civil cases as \\na whole. Scholars observe that circuit courts re-\\nversed approximately half of cases involving deni-\\nals of arbitration (as compared to a mere 10 to 20% \\nof civil cases as a whole, depending on the year ex-\\namined). This statistic is no surprise, however, as \\nit accords with the strong legislative policy in favor \\nof arbitration. This policy would predictably gener-\\nate more reversals of denials of arbitration.   \\n6 \\nThe majority rule better serves the rel evant in-\\nterests of both individuals/consumers and busi-\\nnesses. Further, a clear, bright -line rule better \\nserves the liberal federal public policy favoring ar-\\nbitration and federal court judicial economy. The \\nautomatic stay rule and the divestiture principle \\nare such rules. They promote judicial economy by \\nfreeing up district court resources while cases are \\non appeal and by preventing needless expenditure \\nof district court resources on litigating applications \\nfor discretionary stay. These principles promote \\nconsistency of rulings between trial and appellate \\ncourts. They also advance the form and structure of \\nthe federal civil justice system with its unique \\nfunctions of district and appellate courts.  \\nThe Ninth Circuit got it wrong when it held that \\na district c ourt retains jurisdiction to proceed with \\nlitigation despite a non -frivolous appeal of the de-\\nnial of a motion to compel arbitration. The Third, \\nFourth, Seventh, Tenth, Eleventh, and D.C. Cir-\\ncuits decided the issue correctly when they found \\nthat an interloc utory appeal under Section 16(a) of \\nthe Federal Arbitration Act automatically divests \\nthe district court of jurisdiction and requires a \\ncomplete stay of all litigation. The Ninth Circuit \\nshould be reversed. Its opinion should be vacated.  \\n7 \\nARGUMENT  \\nI.

No principle compels \\nsuch an anomalous result, and this Court should not \\ncreate an Article III except ion that excludes nominal-\\ndamages awards from ordinary justiciability rules. \\nThe officials do not contest that their actions \\ncaused Chike and Joseph real injury. Their argument is that nominal damages do not redress past injuries. \\nBut nominal damages vindic ate constitutional viola-\\ntions, including where the harm is not quantifiable. \\nMemphis Cmty. Sch. Dist. v. Stachura , 477 U.S. 299, \\n308 n.11 (1986) (quoting Carey v. Piphus , 435 U.S. \\n247, 266 (1978)). And contrary to the Eleventh Circuit's belief, they do so \\\"for the plaintiff's benefit.\\\" \\nFarrar v. Hobby , 506 U.S. 103, 113 (1992). Those \\nprinciples, common-law history, and common sense all show that a nominal-damages award provides a \\npersonal, tangible benefit that redresses a plaintiff's \\ninjury. Article III requires nothing more. \\nProviding a remedy to plaintiffs like Chike and \\nJoseph has neither flooded the courts with lawsuits \\nnor bankrupted officials in the many circuits that \\nallow standalone nominal-damages awards. Nominal \\ndamages, like compensato ry damages, have \\\"coex-\\nisted with our constitutional system since the dawn of the Republic.\\\" Tanzin v. Tanvir , __ S. Ct. __, 2020 WL \\n7250100, at 5 (Dec. 10, 2020). And a nation of laws \\nrequires  a way for courts to make things right when \\nofficials violate rights. Because nominal-damages claims satisfy Arti cle III, this Court should reverse. \\n2 \\nREPLY ARGUMENT  \\nI. T h i s  C o u r t  s h o u l d  d e c l i n e  t o  c r e a t e  a n  \\nArticle III exception that excludes nominal-\\ndamages awards from ordinary justicia-\\nbility rules. \\nThe officials do not deny that Chike and Joseph \\nsuffered a concrete injury-in-fact, nor do they deny \\ncausation. Their only objection is redressability. In making that objection, they confuse redressability \\nwith quantifiability . Because nominal damages \\nvindicate past legal violations, Chike and Joseph's nominal-damages claims s atisfy Article III and are \\nnot moot. \\nA. Nominal damages redress past constitu-\\ntional injury. \\nArticle III standing requires  a plaintiff to show he \\nhas suffered (1) a concrete and particularized injury-\\nin-fact, (2) caused by the defendant, (3) that is likely \\nto be redressed by a favorable court ruling. Spokeo, \\nInc. v. Robins , 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016). The \\nofficials do not dispute injury or causation. And \\nredressability requires only that a plaintiff personally \\n\\\"benefit in a tangible way from\\\" court intervention. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't , 523 U.S. 83, \\n103 n.5 (1998) (quotation omitted). A plaintiff \\nsatisfies that test by showing that a court order would \\n\\\"partially redress\\\" his injury. Meese v. Keene , 481 U.S. \\n465, 476 (1987). Nominal-damages awards, though \\nsmall, satisfy that standard.\\n1 \\n \\n1 The officials articulate a second redressability requirement: \\nthat the relief \\\"target and redress the plaintiff's asserted injury\\\" \\nrather than someone else's. Resp.Br.12. But that is no different \\nthan requiring that the remedy \\\"personally\\\" benefit the plaintiff. \\n3 \\nThe officials confuse redressability with quanti-\\nfiability. Consider a studen t who shared her faith on \\ncampus by chalking messages about Jesus Christ on \\nthe sidewalk, only to see a professor direct his class to erase them.\\n2 Even if the officials modified their \\npolicies to prevent this First Amendment violation \\nfrom happening again, the officials admit that this student could litigate to final judgment her 1\\u00a2 \\ncompensatory-damages claim for the consumed chalk. \\nEven a single penny of relief partially benefits the stu-dent personally and in a tangible way. \\nNow consider Chike. The officials do not dispute \\nhe was injured when they twice stopped him from speaking. The problem is that he cannot monetize the \\nlost speech's value. But Chike's lost speech is far more \\nvaluable than the consumed chalk. And it is the lost \\nspeech that gives Chike the right to seek judicial \\nredress; the $1 in nominal damages that officials \\nmust pay Chike is no less a partial redress that personally and tangibly benefits him than is the \\npenny that redresses the chalk user. A nominal-\\ndamages award \\\"modifies th e defendant's behavior \\nfor the plaintiff's benefit by forcing the defendant to \\npay an amount of money he otherwise would not pay.\\\" \\nFarrar , 506 U.S. at 113. And in this way, the payment \\nof nominal damages \\\"materially alters\\\" the parties' \\nlegal relationship, id. at 111\\u201312, in the same way as \\na modest compensatory-damages award. \\n \\n \\n2 Compare with Fresno State Students for Life  v. Thatcher , No. \\n1:17-at-00382 (E.D. Cal.), available at https://perma.cc/566E-\\n6EBZ. . \\n4 \\nThe officials say that whil e one dollar in compen-\\nsatory damages redresses a past injury, one dollar in \\nnominal damages does not. Resp.Br.17\\u201319. Again, \\nthis is confusion over quantifiability. Contra City of \\nRiverside v. Rivera , 477 U.S. 561, 574 (1986) \\n(plaintiff's vindication of \\\"important civil and \\nconstitutional rights that cannot be valued solely in monetary terms\\\"). Courts  award nominal damages \\nprimarily when there has been an \\\"infraction of a \\nlegal right\\\" but the \\\"extent of loss is not shown.\\\" C\\nHARLES T. MCCORMICK , HANDBOOK ON THE LAW OF \\nDAMAGES  \\u00a7 20 at 85 (1935). So it's not that nominal \\ndamages offer \\\" zero legally recognized relief for a past \\ninjury,\\\" Resp.Br.19 (emphasis added), it's that they \\noffer partial relief. Skyline Wesleyan Church v. Cal. \\nDep't of Managed Health Care , 968 F.3d 738, 749 (9th \\nCir. 2020) (\\\"Nominal damages would redress \\nSkyline's injury, even if only to a minimal extent.\\\"). \\nAnd because nominal dama ges \\\"materially alter[  ]\\\" \\nthe parties' relationship, Farrar , 506 U.S. at 111\\u201312, \\nthat is sufficient for Article III. Meese , 481 U.S. at 476. \\n\\\"Nothing more is needed to establish redressability.\\\" Skyline , 968 F.3d at 749. Otherwise, justiciability of \\nidentical claims turns on mere semantics. ACLU Br. \\n11\\u201312 (discussing Freenor v. Mayor & Alderman of \\nSavannah , No. CV414-247, 2019 WL 9936663 (S.D. \\nGa. May 20, 2019)). \\nAs this Court intimated in Carey , nominal dam-\\nages make a constitutional deprivation \\\"actionable.\\\" \\n435 U.S. at 266. That is because they redress a plain-\\ntiff's concrete and particula rized injury in a personal, \\ntangible way. U.S.Br.17\\u201319 (same result if Congress \\nauthorized a minimum $1,000 award for First \\nAmendment violations). A nominal-damages award partially redresses a loss of incalculable value. \\n5 \\nB. This Court's decisions confirm that \\nnominal damages' primary purpose is \\npast redress of valuable\\u2014even \\npriceless\\u2014rights. \\nNominal damages\\u2014like other remedies\\u2014have \\nmultiple effects that can include the declaration of \\nrights or the protection of prospective rights. But this \\nCourt's precedents and numerous lower-court \\ndecisions show that nominal damages' primary \\npurpose is to redress past legal violations. \\nCarey  decided that nominal damages, rather than \\npresumed damages, were the appropriate award for \\nconstitutional violations where harm cannot be mon-etized. 435 U.S. at 266. But the context was not \\\"pro-\\nspective redress.\\\" Contra Resp.Br.24. It was about \\nremedying a past \\\"deprivation\\\" of rights. 435 U.S. at \\n266. That is why the Court did not speak in terms of \\nany \\\"prospective\\\" due-process problem but to the past \\n\\\"denial of procedur al due process.\\\" Ibid. Accord, e.g., \\nStachura , 477 U.S. at 308 & n.11 (same point in free-\\nspeech context); Arizonans for Official English v. \\nArizona , 520 U.S. 43, 69 & n.24 (1997) (contrasting \\nnominal damages and injunctive relief). \\nLikewise, in Farrar , the plaintiff dropped a claim \\nfor injunctive relief and pursued only an unsuccessful compensatory-damages claim.  506 U.S. at 106. In \\ndetermining that a nominal-damages award made the \\nplaintiff a prevailing party under \\u00a7  1983, this Court \\nemphasized that \\\" Carey  obligates a court to award \\nnominal damages when a plaintiff establishes the \\nviolation of his [constitutional] right.\\\" Id. at 112. That \\nis, this Court correctly saw the award of nominal \\ndamages as retrospective redress, not prospective \\nprotection. \\n6 \\nUnsurprisingly, lower courts have consistently \\nrelied on this Court's cases to hold that a plaintiff \\nwhose constitutional rights have been violated \\n\\\"should not lose his right to proceed\\\" if \\\"only nominal damages are at stake.\\\" Amato v. City of Saratoga \\nSprings , 170 F.3d 311, 319 (2d Cir. 1999) (discussing \\nCarey ). Petitioners' opening brief discussed many \\nsuch cases. Pet.Br.27\\u201328. Yet the officials fail to \\nrespond to many. There are more examples, in count-\\nless settings. E.g., ACLU Br. 13\\u201319; Found. for \\nIndividual Rights in Educ. [FIRE] Br. 5\\u20139; Becket Fund Br. 20\\u201325; Pacific Legal Found. Br. 1\\u20134, 12\\u201316.  \\nThe officials' rule also vi olates this Court's prece-\\ndent in analogous contexts. For example, the officials \\ninsist that statutory damages are \\\"different in kind\\\" \\nbecause they \\\"do not signify nothing .\\\" Resp.Br.19\\u201320. \\nBut statutory and nominal damages serve the same \\npurpose: providing \\\"recompense for injury\\\" where \\n\\\"the rules of law render diff icult or impossible proof of \\ndamages.\\\" Douglas v. Cunningham , 294 U.S. 207, 209 \\n(1935). The officials concede that it \\\"is good enough \\nfor Article III\\\" when Congre ss sets statutory damages \\nwhere it \\\"might be hard to measure\\\" actual damages. \\nResp.Br.19\\u201320. It is no different when courts award \\nnominal damages for the same reason. \\nThe same is true of liquidated damages, which \\nassign a fixed value to harm where actual damages \\n\\\"may be difficult or impossible to ascertain.\\\" Rex \\nTrailer Co. v. United States , 350 U.S. 148, 153\\u201354 \\n(1956). And punitive dama ges are non-compensatory \\nand sometimes awarded without compensatory harm. U.S.Br.19\\u201320. Yet the offici als do not dispute that a \\nplaintiff with a standalone claim for statutory, \\nliquidated, or punitive da mages has failed to present \\nan Article III case or controversy. \\n7 \\nThe officials criticize Chike and Joseph for \\nequating \\\"vindication\\\" of rights with Article III \\nredress. Resp.Br.21\\u201323. But where \\\"there has been a \\nviolation of a right, the person injured is entitled to an action. If he is entitled to an action, he is entitled \\nat least to nominal damages,  or else he would not be \\nentitled to a recovery.\\\" Parker v. Griswold , 17 Conn. \\n288, 303 (1846). \\nC. At common law, courts routinely award-\\ned standalone nominal damages solely to redress past injuries. \\nNo one disputes that English and American \\ncommon-law courts consistently adjudicated claims for nominal damages in a wide array of cases, and \\nthat such claims arose from a past violation of rights. \\nYet the officials insist that when common-law courts \\ndid award nominal damages, it was only for \\ncontinuing or threatened injuries. Resp.Br.28\\u201340. \\nCenturies of cases debunk this theory. \\nFor one thing, the officials concede that entire cat-\\negories of common-law cases involved the award of \\nnominal damages even \\\"whe n they would not plainly \\nserve as prospective relief.\\\" Id. at 34. These include \\ncases (like this one) when the plaintiff \\\"proved a legal \\nviolation\\\" but failed to establish or quantify compensatory damages, ibid. , \\\"as a vehicle for costs,\\\" \\nid. at 32\\u201334, or for \\\"dignitary harms,\\\" id. at 38. And \\nthese categories of cases\\u2014which alone undermine the officials' historical analysis\\u2014are just a few examples. \\nEnglish courts inferred nominal damages when-\\never the plaintiff establish ed an invasion of a legal \\nright, no matter if ther e was a continuing or \\nthreatened injury. \\\"[I]njury imports a damage, \\nthough it does not cost the party one farthing.\\\" Ashby  \\n8 \\nv. White , 92 Eng. Rep. 126, 137 (1703) (Holt, J.). \\nCourts \\\"import[ed] a dama ge\\\" for various claims, \\nincluding breach of contract, trespass, and personal \\ninjury. Ibid.  (\\\"a cuff on the ear\\\" would be actionable \\n\\\"for it is a personal injury\\\").  \\nFor personal rights, nominal damages served to \\nremedy past harms, not to  protect against future \\ninjury. In Ashby , for example, the House of Lords held \\nthat an elector who was wrongfully turned away from \\nthe polls by an official could sue without proving the \\\"possibility of a future profi t\\\" or the \\\"possibility of a \\nfuture\\\" damage. 87 Eng. Rep. 810, 810, 813 (1703) \\n(Powell, J., & Gould, J.). Often these violations occurred when an official fa iled to perform his duty \\nbut cured the defect before suit. In these cases, plain-\\ntiffs could still recover nominal damages for the past \\ninjury even though they had no need for prospective \\nrelief. E.g., Barker v. Green , 130 Eng. Rep. 327, 327 \\n(1824) (sheriff's one-day delay in arrest on writ); Bales \\nv. Wingfield , 4 Q.B. 580, n. (multi-week delay by \\nsheriff in executing a lien writ); Clifton  v. Hooper , 115 \\nEng. Rep. 175, 175, 178 (1844) (sheriff delay in exe-cuting process). This was al so true for actions brought \\nagainst private citizens. E.g., Marzetti v. Williams , \\n109 Eng. Rep. 842, 845\\u201347 (1830) (one-day delay in issuing check); Godefroy  v. Jay, 131 Eng. Rep. 159, \\n159\\u201362 (1831) (client could receive nominal damages \\nfor attorney's negligence). \\nAmerican courts followed suit. Plaintiffs could \\nrecover at least nominal damages for injuries caused \\nby public officials without showing the threat of future harm. E.g.,  Mickles v. Hart , 1 Denio 548, 550 \\n(N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1845) (sheriff deputy's delay in \\nexecuting debt); Laflin v. Willard , 33 Mass. 64, 67 \\n(1835) (same); Waterhouse v. Waite , 11 Mass. 207, 210 \\n9 \\n(1814) (same); Burns v. Erben , 26 How. Pr. 273, 277 \\n(N.Y. Super. Ct. 1864) (false imprisonment); Doherty  \\nv. Munson , 127 Mass. 495, 496 (1879) (detention \\nunder illegal warrant). And American courts routinely awarded nominal damages in private \\nactions when such an award could provide no \\nprospective relief. E.g., Thompson  v. New Orleans, J. \\n& G.N.R. Co. , 50 Miss. 315, 320 (1874) (train \\nconductor passed passenger's stop by two miles); \\nCrosby v. Humphreys , 60 N.W. 843, 844 (Minn. 1894) \\n(assault); Young v. W. Union Tel. Co. , 11 S.E. 1044, \\n1044\\u201345 (N.C. 1890) (negligent delay in delivering \\ntelegraph); McKim  v. Bartlett , 129 Mass. 226, 229 \\n(1880) (estate administrator liable for at least nomi-nal damages after court discharged future liability).  \\nThis partial list shows that early American \\ncourts\\u2014like their English counterparts\\u2014undeniably \\nawarded nominal damages so lely for past injuries. \\nAccord, e.g., U.S.Br.10\\u201311; Nat'l Right to Work Legal \\nDef. Found. Br. 4\\u201310. \\nEven a nominal-damages award in a trespass, \\nriparian-rights, or other pr operty case was intended, \\nfirst and foremost, to vindicate the past \\\"violation of \\nthe plaintiff's right.\\\" Delaware & Hudson Canal Co.  \\nv. Torrey , 33 Pa. 143, 148 (1859); accord Embrey v. \\nOwen , 155 Eng. Rep. 579, 585 (1851) (same). And that \\nis why common-law courts awarded nominal damages \\nin property cases even when the parties' future rights \\nand obligations were not at stake. E.g., Hefley  v. \\nBaker , 19 Kan. 9, 11 (1877) (pure trespass case with \\nno property-line dispute); Curtis v. Paggett , 27 P. 109, \\n109\\u201310 (Kan. 1891) (same); Cook v. Loomis , 26 Conn. \\n483, 486 (1857) (trover case where property already \\nreturned); Mears v. Cornwall , 40 N.W. 931, 932\\u201334 \\n(Mich. 1888) (same); Warder v. Baldwin , 8 N.W. 257, \\n10 \\n258 (Wis. 1881) (same); Moon v. Raphael , 132 Eng. \\nRep. 122, 122 (1835) (same). And plaintiffs at common \\nlaw could waive their right to compensatory damages \\nand choose to seek nominal damages alone. Pet.Br.42; \\naccord Daniels v. Bates , 2 Greene 151, 152 (Iowa \\n1849); Pastorius v. Fisher , 1 Rawle 27, 29 (Pa. 1828). \\nThe officials' failure to address so many of these \\ncases is no mere oversight. Many are on all fours with \\nthe constitutional violations at issue here and \\nestablish the common-law ru le that nominal damages \\nsupport a claim for past constitutional violations. So \\ndo cases involving intentional torts. Frederick \\nDouglass Found. Br. 6\\u20138 (c omparing Petitioners' \\ninjuries to those caused by intentional torts, for which \\ncourts awarded nominal damages); Stachura , 477 \\nU.S. at 306 (level of \\u00a7  1983 damages \\\"determined \\naccording to principles de rived from the common law \\nof torts\\\"). \\nThe officials say that, even if common-law courts \\nawarded nominal damages with no \\\"prospective \\nremedial benefits,\\\" such awards were meaningless \\nand insufficient \\\"for maintaining an action.\\\" Resp.Br.35\\u201336. But as detailed above, countless cases \\nheld that a standalone nominal-damages claim \\nsustained a case having no effect on future rights. It would be passing strange for so many courts, over so \\nmany years, to adjudicate  nominal-damages claims \\nthat they thought served no purpose and, in the officials' view, violated redressability requirements. \\nFinally, while early common-law courts may have \\nbeen unwilling to reverse a trial court's failure to award nominal damages in trifling or frivolous cases, \\nResp.Br.34\\u201335; Fleming  v. Gilbert , 3 Johns 528, 532 \\n(N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1808); Robertson v. Gentry , 5 Ky. 542, \\n11 \\n543 (Ct. App. 1812), that reluctance faded when \\n\\\"important\\\" rights were at stake. Blackburn v. Ala. \\nGreat S. R. Co. , 39 So. 345, 346 (Ala. 1905); Hecht  v. \\nHarrison , 40 P. 306, 309\\u201310 (Wyo. 1895). Modern \\ncourts view nominal damages the same way when a \\nplaintiff alleges a constitutional violation. E.g., Risdal \\nv. Halford , 209 F.3d 1071, 1073 (8th Cir. 2000) \\n(reversing for plain error because the district court \\nfailed to instruct the jury  to award nominal damages \\nif it found a free-speech violation); Zok v. State , 903 \\nP.2d 574, 579 (Alaska 1995) (failure to award nominal \\ndamages for unlawful arrest was plain error because \\nthe \\\"right to be free from unlawful confinement is sufficiently important and fundamental in our \\nsociety\\\"). Indeed, circuit co urts uniformly hold that an \\naward of nominal damages is mandatory upon \\nproving a constitutional violation. Pet.Br.30\\u201331 n.4 \\n(collecting cases). The officials' cramped theory of \\nnominal damages cannot explain away this history. \\nD. Nominal damages are not a mere \\nanalogue for declaratory relief. \\nNominal damages' primary purpose is to redress \\na past injury. Yet the officials continue to assert that \\n\\\"[d]eclaratory judgments are the analogue,\\\" \\nResp.Br.41, unless sovereign or qualified immunity is at stake, in which case th e officials feel differently, id. \\nat 42 n.3. The officials are incorrect. U.S.Br.23\\u201327. \\nTo be sure, \\\"all judgments of courts declare jural \\nrelations.\\\" Edwin M. Borchard, The Declaratory \\nJudgment\\u2014A Needed Procedural Reform , 28 Y\\nALE \\nL.J. 1, 4 (1918). Yet courts do not equate all forms of \\nrelief with declaratory judgments just because they share this one trait. \\n12 \\nNor do the officials rebut the many other differ-\\nences between declaratory judgments and nominal \\ndamages that unravel their flawed analogy. First, \\nnominal damages are legal relief, while declaratory judgments are equitable. Resp.Br.42 n.3. Second, \\ndeclaratory judgments were designed to determine \\nlegal rights \\\" before breach .\\\" Edwin M. Borchard, The \\nUniform Act on Declaratory Judgments , 34 H\\nARV. L. \\nREV. 697, 707 (1921). Nominal damages remedy past \\nharm, unavailable until an injury has occurred. C\\nHARLES T. MCCORMICK , HANDBOOK ON THE LAW OF \\nDAMAGES  \\u00a7 20 at 85 (1935) (\\\"Nominal damages are \\nawarded for the infraction of a legal right.\\\"). \\nThird, declaratory judgments are primarily \\nprospective relief, Christian Legal Soc'y v. Martinez , \\n561 U.S. 661, 676 n.6 (2010), while nominal damages, \\nwhich require a past violation, are primarily retro-\\nspective, Arizonans for Official English , 520 U.S. at \\n69 & n.24.   Fourth, the Declaratory Judgment Act \\n\\\"confers a discretion  on the courts,\\\" not an \\\"absolute \\nright upon the litigant.\\\" Wilton v. Seven Falls Co. , 515 \\nU.S. 277, 287 (1995). Nominal damages are manda-tory. Farrar , 506 U.S. at 112 (\\\" Carey obligate[d] a \\ncourt to award nominal damages when a plaintiff \\nestablishes the violation of his right\\\"). And finally, \\nunlike declaratory judgments,  courts have held that \\nnominal damages are subject to sovereign- and \\nqualified-immunity defenses. E.g., Am. Civil Liberties \\nUnion v. U.S. Conf. of Cath. Bishops , 705 F.3d 44, 53 \\nn.7 (1st Cir. 2013) (sovereign immunity); Hopkins v. \\nSaunders , 199 F.3d 968, 978 (8th Cir. 1999) (qualified \\nimmunity). \\nIn sum, the disparities between declaratory judg-\\nments and nominal damages are stark. And rightly \\nso, as their primary purpose is decidedly different. \\n13 \\nE. The officials' view of nominal damages \\ncontradicts Article III requirements. \\nRationalizing some of the many instances in \\nwhich common-law courts awarded nominal damages \\nfor the past violation of rights, the officials argue that \\nthe \\\"jurisdictional hook\\\" is \\\"the plaintiff's live claim \\nfor compensatory damages.\\\" Resp.Br.26. This hook saves a nominal-damages claim from mootness, say \\nthe officials, even if the plaintiff's compensatory-\\ndamages claim fail s on the merits. Ibid.  That \\nreasoning cannot be right. \\nTo begin, \\\"a plaintiff must demonstrate standing \\nfor each claim he seeks to press and for each form of relief that is sought.\\\" Town of Chester v. Laroe Ests., \\nInc., 137 S. Ct. 1645, 1650 (2017) (citation omitted). It \\nis impossible for a compensatory-damage remedy to \\nbe a \\\"jurisdictional hook\\\" for a separate, moot remedy. \\nA nominal-damages remedy mu st (and does) stand on \\nits own merits from the case's inception. \\nIn addition, \\\"an actual controversy must be extant \\nat all stages of review, not merely at the time the com-\\nplaint is filed.\\\" Arizonans for Official English , 520 \\nU.S. at 67 (citation omitted). Once a plausible claim \\nfor compensatory damages fail s at the merits stage, it \\nis again impossible for that claim to be a \\\"jurisdictional hook\\\" for a separate, moot claim. \\nMoreover, a plaintiff must quantify injury to \\nclaim compensatory damage s. Yet the loss of First \\nAmendment freedoms like speech and religious \\nexercise constitutes \\\"irreparable injury.\\\" Roman \\nCatholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , __ S. Ct. __, \\n2020 WL 6948354, at 3 (Nov. 25, 2020). Such injury \\n\\\"cannot be adequately measured or compensated by \\nmoney.\\\" Irreparable Injury , B\\nLACK 'S LAW DICTIONARY  \\n14 \\n(11th ed. 2019). The officials' position would lead to \\nthe indefensible result that the appropriate remedy \\nfor a past violation of rights is one that in some cases \\nwill not be available. \\nFinally, the officials' position deprives some \\nvictims of government misconduct of any remedy. The \\nofficials say that without plausible compensatory-damages remedies, plaintiffs can still \\\"vindicate their \\nrights through claims for prospective relief like \\ninjunctions and declaratory judgments.\\\" Resp.Br.46\\u201348. But that only underscor es the correctness of Chike \\nand Joseph's position: that eliminating the nominal-\\ndamages remedy would allo w officials to make a \\nstrategic post-filing change in policy solely to moot \\nprospective relief. Such a risk is real because \\ngovernment officials have strong incentives to moot \\ncases. Becket Fund Br. 8\\u201314; Joseph C. Davis & \\nNicholas R. Reaves, The Point Isn't Moot: How Lower \\nCourts Have Blessed Go vernment Abuse of the \\nVoluntary-Cessation Doctrine , 129 Y\\nALE L.J.  FORUM  \\n325 (2019). The officials propose a phantom remedy to \\ninsulate their unconstitutional acts from legal accountability. \\n  \\n15 \\nII. The officials' reasons for creating a nominal-\\ndamages exception to Article III are indefensible. \\nThe officials predict dire  effects if this Court \\nallows partial redress for the violation of Chike and \\nJoseph's rights. Yet it ha s been \\\"widely recognized\\\" \\nfor ages \\\"that a claim for nominal damages precludes mootness\\\" based on later events. N.Y. State Rifle & \\nPistol Ass'n v. City of N.Y. , 140 S. Ct. 1525, 1536 \\n(2020) (Alito, J., dissenting); Pet.Br.14 n.2 (catalog-uing eight circuits' rule). None of these asserted \\nconsequences have material ized in the jurisdictions \\nthat have rejected the Eleventh Circuit's novel and indefensible approach. The officials' arguments lack \\nmerit. \\nA. The majority rule does not require \\nadvisory opinions. \\nThe officials say that nominal-damages claims \\ninvite advisory opinions. Resp.Br. 2, 9\\u201310, 22, 41\\u201342. Not so. To quote the officials' own cases, advisory opinions \\\"advis[e] what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\\\" Aetna Life Ins. Co. of \\nHartford v. Haworth , 300 U.S. 227, 241 (1937). \\nAccord, e.g., Preiser v. Newkirk , 422 U.S. 395, 401 \\n(1975) (same);  Ashcroft v. Mattis , 431 U.S. 171, 172 \\n(1977) (per curiam). That's not the request here. \\nChike and Joseph present real-world facts and \\n\\\"concrete legal issues, presented in [an] actual case[  ],\\\" \\nGolden v. Zwickler , 394 U.S. 103, 108 (1969): whether \\nofficials violated their free -speech rights. It is not \\nclear why the officials believe that question is more hypothetical here than if Chike's speech had con-sumed 1\\u00a2 of chalk, particularly when the officials do \\n16 \\nnot contest he suffered a cognizable injury-in-fact. \\nThere is nothing advisory about deciding the question \\nand awarding nominal damages. Young Ams. for \\nLiberty Br. 12; Christia n Legal Soc'y Br. 5\\u20136. \\nB. The majority rule does not eliminate the \\nmootness doctrine. \\nThe longstanding majority rule has not \\\"swal-\\nlowed\\\" the mootness doctrine in the eight circuits that \\nfollow it. Contra Resp.Br.43\\u201345. Many constitutional \\ncases seek only prospectiv e relief, either because \\ndamages are barred by sovereign immunity or because the injury is threatened or imminent but has not yet occurred at the time of filing. The mootness doctrine is alive and well for those cases. The \\nsituation here\\u2014where the officials already violated \\nChike's and Joseph's constitutional rights\\u2014presents \\nthe flip side of mootness: fed eral courts are obligated \\nto adjudicate live controversies. Knox v. Serv. Emps. \\nInt'l Union, Local 1000 , 567 U.S. 298, 307\\u201308 (2012). \\nPlus, the officials' concer n for the vitality of the \\nmootness doctrine is selective. They concede that the \\ndoctrine has not crumbled ev en though a plaintiff can \\navoid mootness by seeking compensation for negli-gible financial damages. Resp.Br.49. So, it will not disintegrate if a plaintiff seeks justice without putting \\nhimself and the courts through the trouble and \\ndisproportionate expense of monetizing, proving, and \\nassessing those injuries, as long experience in the courts of appeals attests. Ar ticle III does not require \\nplaintiffs to repackage no minal-damages claims as \\nsmall damages claims. Both types of claims ensure a \\nlive controversy. \\n17 \\nFar more troublesome problems arise under the \\nofficials' rule, which allows governments to moot \\ncases unilaterally and strategically. That approach \\nallows officials to reinstate unconstitutional policies, a phenomenon that the amici have well documented. \\nFIRE Br. 24\\u201327; Becket Fund Br. 10\\u201314; Just. & Free-\\ndom Fund Br. 9, 15\\u201316 & n.4. It creates incentives for officials to run out the clock on many claims, e.g., \\ndelaying until students gr aduate, or prisoners get \\ntransferred. Islam & Religious Freedom Br. 14\\u201315; Inst. for Free Speech Br. 14\\u20131 5; Becket Fund Br. 23\\u2013\\n25; Christian Legal Soc'y Br. 15\\u201317; FIRE Br. 5\\u20137. \\nIn short, the officials' mootness-related policy \\nconcerns do not justify their invitation to jettison the \\nmajority rule and create a nominal-damages excep-\\ntion to Article III. \\nC. The majority rule neither wastes judicial \\nresources nor prolongs cases.  \\nThe officials and their amici say that the enduring \\nmajority rule wastes judicial resources, prolongs \\nlawsuits, and increases attorney fees. Resp.Br.45; \\nD.C.Br. 13\\u201321. But government officials who quickly and \\\"reasonably respond\\\" when initially alerted to an unconstitutional policy, D.C.Br. 4\\u201311, rarely face protracted litigation. \\nConsider what happened here. Three years before \\nChike tried to speak on campus\\u2014in 2013 \\u2014counsel \\ninformed Georgia Gwinnett officials that their poli-cies were unconstitutional. Pet.App.89a\\u201390a. The of-ficials did nothing. Chike questioned the overbreadth and inconsistency of the officia ls' policies when he was \\nordered to stop speaking in 2016. Id. at 100a\\u201302a. \\nAgain, officials did nothing. When Chike filed suit in \\n18 \\nDecember 2016, the officials did not recant; they dou-\\nbled down, insisting that sharing the Christian faith \\n\\\"arguably rose to the level of 'fighting words'\\\" that the \\nFirst Amendment does not protect. Id. at 155a. \\nIt was not until much later in the case that the \\nofficials changed their unconstitutional policies and then promptly moved to dismiss. Id. at 160a. Imagine \\nhow much litigation and how many constitutional \\ndeprivations the officials could have avoided simply \\nby \\\"reasonably responding\\\" in 2013. \\nThe reality is officials oft en stubbornly refuse to \\nconcede that they have vi olated someone's constitu-\\ntional rights. E.g., N.Y. State Rifle & Pistol Ass'n , 140 \\nS. Ct. at 1538\\u201339 (Alito, J., dissenting) (city fought the \\nplaintiffs' Second Amendment rights \\\"tooth and nail\\\" \\nin lower courts, then strategically changed policy to \\n\\\"moot\\\" the case on the eve of oral argument in this Court). The amici briefs are replete with such examples. E.g., Becket Fund Br. 3 (prison changed \\npolicy \\\"[t]wo weeks before oral argument\\\"); \\nCatholicVote.org Br. 12 n.4 (city repealed ordinance \\n\\\"years into litigation\\\" an d \\\"days\\\" after grant of en \\nbanc review); Pacific Legal Found. Br. 1\\u20132 (city repealed ban \\\"[o]n the eve of oral argument\\\"); FIRE Br. 7 (universities \\\"disavow[  ]\\\" policies \\\"after the \\nstart of litigation\\\"). And though the District of \\nColumbia amici say the Eleventh Circuit's rule \\n\\\"incentivizes government actors to revisit challenged laws,\\\" the brief's listed examples all come from outside the Eleventh Circuit. D.C.Br. 4\\u201311. Indeed, the officials here changed their policies several months before  the Eleventh Circuit adopted its outlier \\nrule, further proving that the majority rule already \\nencourages officials to do the right thing. \\n19 \\nConversely, the longstanding rule does not \\nencourage plaintiffs to pursue pointless litigation \\nsimply to inflict an attorn ey-fee award. This \\\"Court's \\ndecision not to grant fees in Farrar was born of its \\nreluctance to reward attorneys for bringing less than \\nmeritorious claims that see k, but fail to obtain, large \\nmonetary judgments or fail to promote a larger public good.\\\" Project Vote/Voting for Am., Inc.  v. Dickerson , \\n444 F. App'x 660, 664 (4th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) \\n(citing Farrar , 506 U.S. at 116). The same will be true \\nin cases brought simply to harass. But a meritorious \\ncivil-rights claim brought to stop unconstitutional government conduct \\\"is the very form of litigation Congress wished to encourage by enacting \\u00a7  1988.\\\" \\nIbid.  (citing Daly v. Hill, 790 F.2d 1071, 1084 (4th Cir. \\n1986)). Accord, e.g., Fox v. Vice, 563 U.S. 826, 832\\u201333 \\n(2011) (characterizing a successful \\u00a7 1983 plaintiff pursuing \\u00a7 1988 fees as \\\"a private attorney general\\\") (citation omitted). \\\"Deterring meritorious lawsuits on constitutional issues because they offer a small \\nlikelihood of a significant money judgment presents \\nas grave a danger to our legal system as frivolous litigation.\\\" Project Vote , F. App'x at 664\\u201365 (quoting \\nKoopman v. Water Dist. No. 1 of Johnson Cnty. , 41 \\nF.3d 1417, 1421 (10th Cir. 1994)). Accord Rutherford Inst. Br. 7\\u201312 (discussing implications of tactical \\nmooting).  \\nIt's not even clear that following the majority rule \\nwould appreciably increase caseloads. The officials \\nhave provided no evidence that the circuits applying \\nthe majority rule have been overwhelmed with nominal-damages cases. Contra Inst. for Free Speech \\nBr. 16\\u201317 n.11 (statistics showing the opposite). In \\nthe long run, reaching the merits conserves judicial \\n20 \\nresources by produc ing precedent that obviates future \\ndisputes\\u2014sometimes on precisely the same issue,  \\nwhere unconstitutional policies are reinstated after a \\ncase has been strategically mooted. Id. at 17; The \\nPoint Isn't Moot , 129 Y ALE L.J.  FORUM  at 338\\u201341. \\nFinally, the most effective way to minimize \\nconstitutional violations is to hold recalcitrant officials accountable, not to deny victims the remedy \\nArticle III allows. Just. & Freedom Fund Br. 17\\u201318; \\ncontra Br. of Nat'l Conf. of State Legislatures 23\\u201324. When, as here, a prospective plaintiff sends government officials a warning letter, alerting them to unconstitutional conduct, the potential negative consequences of a future judgment, see Br. of Nat'l \\nConf. of State Legislatures 23\\u201324, are precisely what \\nmotivate the officials to change course. Officials who \\nknow they can violate constitutional rights without cost have no incentive to stop violating the Constitution. \\nIn sum, allowing the gove rnment to unilaterally \\nmoot claims for past consti tutional violations would \\nundermine the vindication of constitutional rights \\nand the Constitution itself. After all, courts are the \\\"department of the government to whom the protection of the rights of the individual is by the \\nconstitution especially confided.\\\" 1\\n ST. GEORGE \\nTUCKER , BLACKSTONE 'S COMMENTARIES , App. 357 \\n(1803). Prohibiting the government from doing so would not change the prevailing legal landscape. \\n  \\n21 \\nIII. The officials' rule would leave plaintiffs \\nwithout a remedy and result in more violations of constitutional rights.  \\nAbandoning the majority rule would leave some \\nvictims of constitutional violations without a remedy. \\nEquitable relief is often unavailable or easily mooted \\n(as shown here), and constitutional violations often do not cause quantifiable harm. Pet.Br.37; FIRE Br. 5\\u20139. The officials fail to meaningfully engage these points. \\nThe officials first insist that these claims \\\"can \\noften be adjudicated\\\" via \\\"prospective relief.\\\" \\nResp.Br.46. But \\\"can often\\\" means \\\"not always,\\\" since such relief is available only when the illegal conduct \\\"might happen again.\\\" Ibid. Those mistreated under \\na later-repealed policy or  subjected to \\\"one-off\\\" \\nviolations have no such reme dy. This gives officials at \\nleast one \\\"free pass\\\" to violate the Constitution.   \\nSuch a rule also artificia lly constricts the judici-\\nary's ability and duty to protect individual rights \\nbased on an unsupported as surance that officials will \\nuse this leeway altruistic ally and correct mistakes \\nquickly. Perhaps the offic ials' suggested approach \\nwould work if we were governed by angels rather than \\nmere \\\"men.\\\" T\\nHE FEDERALIST NO. 51, at 322 (James \\nMadison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961). But amici \\nrecount myriad experiences demonstrating that the judiciary serves as an important check-and-balance. \\nWorse, civil-rights litigants already face daunting \\nterrain:  persuading attorn eys to pro bono represent \\nthem, exhausting administrative remedies, and surviving immunity, which shields all but those who \\ndefy clearly established law. And at least six circuits \\n22 \\nhave even lowered the burden on officials to show a \\ncase is moot. The Point Isn't Moot , 129 Y ALE L.J.  \\nFORUM  at 333, n.50. The Eleventh Circuit, like others, \\ngives government officials \\\"considerably more leeway \\nthan private parties in the presumption that they are \\nunlikely to resume illegal activities.\\\" Coral Springs \\nSt. Sys., Inc.  v. City of Sunrise , 371 F.3d 1320, 1328\\u2013\\n29 (11th Cir. 2004). \\nThis flipped burden forces plaintiffs to prove\\u2014\\nusually with no discovery\\u2014that officials will revert to \\nthe original policy. Yet officials are \\\"more likely to strategically moot cases, not less\\\" than private defendants. The Point Isn't Moot , 129 Y\\nALE L.J.  \\nFORUM  at 335. Accord Becket Fund Br. 8\\u201314; FIRE \\nBr. 24\\u201328; CAIR Br. 15\\u201317. \\nFor \\\"one-off\\\" violations, the officials insist the \\nremedy is compensation. Resp.Br.49\\u201352. But again, this helps only those who ha ve suffered quantifiable \\nharm. And examples abound of constitutional injuries \\nthat often are not compens able, including unlawful \\nentry of private residences, denial of kosher meals in \\nprison, zoning restrictions on religious institutions, door-to-door proselytizin g restrictions, and free \\nspeech claims on campus\\u2014all examples that would transform difficulty pr oving damages into a \\njurisdictional bar. Hudson  v. Michigan , 547 U.S. 586, \\n610 (2006) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (\\\"the majority, like \\nMichigan and the United States, has failed to cite a single reported case in which a plaintiff has collected more than nominal damages solely as a result of a knock-and-announce violation\\\"); Just. & Freedom Fund Br. 5 n.2; CatholicVote .org Br. 16; ACLU Br. \\n17\\u201318; Islam & Religious Freedom Br. 8\\u20139; Becket \\nFund Br. 20\\u201325; Seventh- Day Adventists Br. 20. \\n23 \\nPlus, some religiously motivated plaintiffs only \\nwant justice or are reluctant to seek money damages \\nfor theological reasons. It's a perverse incentive to \\nforce  such plaintiffs to demand compensatory \\ndamages they do not want or need. \\nNor are compensatory damages for intangible \\ninjuries a cure-all. Many circuits require plaintiffs to prove those injuries without relying on their \\nsubjective testimony, and statutes and immunities \\nimpose more hurdles. Becket Fund Br. 15\\u201318. In these and other civil rights ca ses, plaintiffs steer clear \\nof compensatory damages because \\\"causation and quantification of damages are burdensome to litigate,\\\" \\\"there is little prospect of substantial \\nrecovery,\\\" and these clai ms \\\"profoundly irritate[  ] the \\njudge.\\\" Douglas Laycock, The Triumph of Equity , 56 \\nL.\\n & CONTEMP . PROBS . 53, 63 (1993). Discarding the \\nmajority rule on nominal damages leaves no remedy for those plaintiffs who do not have monetizable harm, rendering their rights unenforceable and \\neffectively nonexistent. \\nIf the Court creates an artificial jurisdictional bar \\nthat renders rights unenforceable in certain circum-stances, it is not difficult to predict that more viola-\\ntions of constitutional rights will follow. As this Court \\nhas already recognized, nominal-damages awards \\nensure that constitutional  rights are \\\"scrupulously \\nobserved.\\\" Carey , 435 U.S. at 266. Excluding such \\nawards from Article III would guarantee the opposite outcome. Although this problem extends to many backdrops, the context presented here\\u2014free speech on public college and university campuses\\u2014provides \\na stark illustration. \\n24 \\nNearly 90% of public, postsecondary institutions \\nmaintain policies that severely restrict protected \\nspeech or could be applied to do so. FIRE Br. 14\\u201323. \\nMany of these policies ar e vague and overbroad, \\nincluding granting officials unfettered discretion to \\nsilence and punish, or prohibiting offensive expres-\\nsion based on third-party perceptions ( i.e., heckler \\nvetoes). \\nGiven that evidence, there is a real risk that a \\nnew rule disallowing standalone nominal-damages claims would lead university officials to strategically moot controversies after  a student's rights are \\nviolated. Doubling down on constitutional depriva-tions would inevitably extend off campus to other \\ngovernment officials, endangering not just free speech \\nand religious exercise, but also Second Amendment \\nrights, the right to be free from illegal searches, unlawful detentions, and many others. \\nA constitutional right that cannot be enforced is \\nno right at all. This Court should say so and reverse.  \\n \\n25 \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_content_alt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3737,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"....................................................... 25  \\n \\n  \\niii \\nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES  \\nCases  \\nAetna Life Insurance Company of Hartford v. \\nHaworth ,  \\n300 U.S. 227 (1937) ............................................. 15 \\nAmato v.

No principle compels \\nsuch an anomalous result, and this Court should not \\ncreate an Article III except ion that excludes nominal-\\ndamages awards from ordinary justiciability rules. \\nThe officials do not contest that their actions \\ncaused Chike and Joseph real injury. Their argument is that nominal damages do not redress past injuries. \\nBut nominal damages vindic ate constitutional viola-\\ntions, including where the harm is not quantifiable. \\nMemphis Cmty. Sch. Dist. v. Stachura , 477 U.S. 299, \\n308 n.11 (1986) (quoting Carey v. Piphus , 435 U.S. \\n247, 266 (1978)). And contrary to the Eleventh Circuit's belief, they do so \\\"for the plaintiff's benefit.\\\" \\nFarrar v. Hobby , 506 U.S. 103, 113 (1992). Those \\nprinciples, common-law history, and common sense all show that a nominal-damages award provides a \\npersonal, tangible benefit that redresses a plaintiff's \\ninjury. Article III requires nothing more. \\nProviding a remedy to plaintiffs like Chike and \\nJoseph has neither flooded the courts with lawsuits \\nnor bankrupted officials in the many circuits that \\nallow standalone nominal-damages awards. Nominal \\ndamages, like compensato ry damages, have \\\"coex-\\nisted with our constitutional system since the dawn of the Republic.\\\" Tanzin v. Tanvir , __ S. Ct. __, 2020 WL \\n7250100, at 5 (Dec. 10, 2020). And a nation of laws \\nrequires  a way for courts to make things right when \\nofficials violate rights. Because nominal-damages claims satisfy Arti cle III, this Court should reverse. \\n2 \\nREPLY ARGUMENT  \\nI. T h i s  C o u r t  s h o u l d  d e c l i n e  t o  c r e a t e  a n  \\nArticle III exception that excludes nominal-\\ndamages awards from ordinary justicia-\\nbility rules. \\nThe officials do not deny that Chike and Joseph \\nsuffered a concrete injury-in-fact, nor do they deny \\ncausation. Their only objection is redressability. In making that objection, they confuse redressability \\nwith quantifiability . Because nominal damages \\nvindicate past legal violations, Chike and Joseph's nominal-damages claims s atisfy Article III and are \\nnot moot. \\nA. Nominal damages redress past constitu-\\ntional injury. \\nArticle III standing requires  a plaintiff to show he \\nhas suffered (1) a concrete and particularized injury-\\nin-fact, (2) caused by the defendant, (3) that is likely \\nto be redressed by a favorable court ruling. Spokeo, \\nInc. v. Robins , 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016). The \\nofficials do not dispute injury or causation. And \\nredressability requires only that a plaintiff personally \\n\\\"benefit in a tangible way from\\\" court intervention. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't , 523 U.S. 83, \\n103 n.5 (1998) (quotation omitted). A plaintiff \\nsatisfies that test by showing that a court order would \\n\\\"partially redress\\\" his injury. Meese v. Keene , 481 U.S. \\n465, 476 (1987). Nominal-damages awards, though \\nsmall, satisfy that standard.\\n1 \\n \\n1 The officials articulate a second redressability requirement: \\nthat the relief \\\"target and redress the plaintiff's asserted injury\\\" \\nrather than someone else's. Resp.Br.12. But that is no different \\nthan requiring that the remedy \\\"personally\\\" benefit the plaintiff. \\n3 \\nThe officials confuse redressability with quanti-\\nfiability. Consider a studen t who shared her faith on \\ncampus by chalking messages about Jesus Christ on \\nthe sidewalk, only to see a professor direct his class to erase them.\\n2 Even if the officials modified their \\npolicies to prevent this First Amendment violation \\nfrom happening again, the officials admit that this student could litigate to final judgment her 1\\u00a2 \\ncompensatory-damages claim for the consumed chalk. \\nEven a single penny of relief partially benefits the stu-dent personally and in a tangible way. \\nNow consider Chike. The officials do not dispute \\nhe was injured when they twice stopped him from speaking. The problem is that he cannot monetize the \\nlost speech's value. But Chike's lost speech is far more \\nvaluable than the consumed chalk. And it is the lost \\nspeech that gives Chike the right to seek judicial \\nredress; the $1 in nominal damages that officials \\nmust pay Chike is no less a partial redress that personally and tangibly benefits him than is the \\npenny that redresses the chalk user. A nominal-\\ndamages award \\\"modifies th e defendant's behavior \\nfor the plaintiff's benefit by forcing the defendant to \\npay an amount of money he otherwise would not pay.\\\" \\nFarrar , 506 U.S. at 113. And in this way, the payment \\nof nominal damages \\\"materially alters\\\" the parties' \\nlegal relationship, id. at 111\\u201312, in the same way as \\na modest compensatory-damages award. \\n \\n \\n2 Compare with Fresno State Students for Life  v. Thatcher , No. \\n1:17-at-00382 (E.D. Cal.), available at https://perma.cc/566E-\\n6EBZ. . \\n4 \\nThe officials say that whil e one dollar in compen-\\nsatory damages redresses a past injury, one dollar in \\nnominal damages does not. Resp.Br.17\\u201319. Again, \\nthis is confusion over quantifiability. Contra City of \\nRiverside v. Rivera , 477 U.S. 561, 574 (1986) \\n(plaintiff's vindication of \\\"important civil and \\nconstitutional rights that cannot be valued solely in monetary terms\\\"). Courts  award nominal damages \\nprimarily when there has been an \\\"infraction of a \\nlegal right\\\" but the \\\"extent of loss is not shown.\\\" C\\nHARLES T. MCCORMICK , HANDBOOK ON THE LAW OF \\nDAMAGES  \\u00a7 20 at 85 (1935). So it's not that nominal \\ndamages offer \\\" zero legally recognized relief for a past \\ninjury,\\\" Resp.Br.19 (emphasis added), it's that they \\noffer partial relief. Skyline Wesleyan Church v. Cal. \\nDep't of Managed Health Care , 968 F.3d 738, 749 (9th \\nCir. 2020) (\\\"Nominal damages would redress \\nSkyline's injury, even if only to a minimal extent.\\\"). \\nAnd because nominal dama ges \\\"materially alter[  ]\\\" \\nthe parties' relationship, Farrar , 506 U.S. at 111\\u201312, \\nthat is sufficient for Article III. Meese , 481 U.S. at 476. \\n\\\"Nothing more is needed to establish redressability.\\\" Skyline , 968 F.3d at 749. Otherwise, justiciability of \\nidentical claims turns on mere semantics. ACLU Br. \\n11\\u201312 (discussing Freenor v. Mayor & Alderman of \\nSavannah , No. CV414-247, 2019 WL 9936663 (S.D. \\nGa. May 20, 2019)). \\nAs this Court intimated in Carey , nominal dam-\\nages make a constitutional deprivation \\\"actionable.\\\" \\n435 U.S. at 266. That is because they redress a plain-\\ntiff's concrete and particula rized injury in a personal, \\ntangible way. U.S.Br.17\\u201319 (same result if Congress \\nauthorized a minimum $1,000 award for First \\nAmendment violations). A nominal-damages award partially redresses a loss of incalculable value. \\n5 \\nB. This Court's decisions confirm that \\nnominal damages' primary purpose is \\npast redress of valuable\\u2014even \\npriceless\\u2014rights. \\nNominal damages\\u2014like other remedies\\u2014have \\nmultiple effects that can include the declaration of \\nrights or the protection of prospective rights. But this \\nCourt's precedents and numerous lower-court \\ndecisions show that nominal damages' primary \\npurpose is to redress past legal violations. \\nCarey  decided that nominal damages, rather than \\npresumed damages, were the appropriate award for \\nconstitutional violations where harm cannot be mon-etized. 435 U.S. at 266. But the context was not \\\"pro-\\nspective redress.\\\" Contra Resp.Br.24. It was about \\nremedying a past \\\"deprivation\\\" of rights. 435 U.S. at \\n266. That is why the Court did not speak in terms of \\nany \\\"prospective\\\" due-process problem but to the past \\n\\\"denial of procedur al due process.\\\" Ibid. Accord, e.g., \\nStachura , 477 U.S. at 308 & n.11 (same point in free-\\nspeech context); Arizonans for Official English v. \\nArizona , 520 U.S. 43, 69 & n.24 (1997) (contrasting \\nnominal damages and injunctive relief). \\nLikewise, in Farrar , the plaintiff dropped a claim \\nfor injunctive relief and pursued only an unsuccessful compensatory-damages claim.  506 U.S. at 106. In \\ndetermining that a nominal-damages award made the \\nplaintiff a prevailing party under \\u00a7  1983, this Court \\nemphasized that \\\" Carey  obligates a court to award \\nnominal damages when a plaintiff establishes the \\nviolation of his [constitutional] right.\\\" Id. at 112. That \\nis, this Court correctly saw the award of nominal \\ndamages as retrospective redress, not prospective \\nprotection. \\n6 \\nUnsurprisingly, lower courts have consistently \\nrelied on this Court's cases to hold that a plaintiff \\nwhose constitutional rights have been violated \\n\\\"should not lose his right to proceed\\\" if \\\"only nominal damages are at stake.\\\" Amato v. City of Saratoga \\nSprings , 170 F.3d 311, 319 (2d Cir. 1999) (discussing \\nCarey ). Petitioners' opening brief discussed many \\nsuch cases. Pet.Br.27\\u201328. Yet the officials fail to \\nrespond to many. There are more examples, in count-\\nless settings. E.g., ACLU Br. 13\\u201319; Found. for \\nIndividual Rights in Educ. [FIRE] Br. 5\\u20139; Becket Fund Br. 20\\u201325; Pacific Legal Found. Br. 1\\u20134, 12\\u201316.  \\nThe officials' rule also vi olates this Court's prece-\\ndent in analogous contexts. For example, the officials \\ninsist that statutory damages are \\\"different in kind\\\" \\nbecause they \\\"do not signify nothing .\\\" Resp.Br.19\\u201320. \\nBut statutory and nominal damages serve the same \\npurpose: providing \\\"recompense for injury\\\" where \\n\\\"the rules of law render diff icult or impossible proof of \\ndamages.\\\" Douglas v. Cunningham , 294 U.S. 207, 209 \\n(1935). The officials concede that it \\\"is good enough \\nfor Article III\\\" when Congre ss sets statutory damages \\nwhere it \\\"might be hard to measure\\\" actual damages. \\nResp.Br.19\\u201320. It is no different when courts award \\nnominal damages for the same reason. \\nThe same is true of liquidated damages, which \\nassign a fixed value to harm where actual damages \\n\\\"may be difficult or impossible to ascertain.\\\" Rex \\nTrailer Co. v. United States , 350 U.S. 148, 153\\u201354 \\n(1956). And punitive dama ges are non-compensatory \\nand sometimes awarded without compensatory harm. U.S.Br.19\\u201320. Yet the offici als do not dispute that a \\nplaintiff with a standalone claim for statutory, \\nliquidated, or punitive da mages has failed to present \\nan Article III case or controversy. \\n7 \\nThe officials criticize Chike and Joseph for \\nequating \\\"vindication\\\" of rights with Article III \\nredress. Resp.Br.21\\u201323. But where \\\"there has been a \\nviolation of a right, the person injured is entitled to an action. If he is entitled to an action, he is entitled \\nat least to nominal damages,  or else he would not be \\nentitled to a recovery.\\\" Parker v. Griswold , 17 Conn. \\n288, 303 (1846). \\nC. At common law, courts routinely award-\\ned standalone nominal damages solely to redress past injuries. \\nNo one disputes that English and American \\ncommon-law courts consistently adjudicated claims for nominal damages in a wide array of cases, and \\nthat such claims arose from a past violation of rights. \\nYet the officials insist that when common-law courts \\ndid award nominal damages, it was only for \\ncontinuing or threatened injuries. Resp.Br.28\\u201340. \\nCenturies of cases debunk this theory. \\nFor one thing, the officials concede that entire cat-\\negories of common-law cases involved the award of \\nnominal damages even \\\"whe n they would not plainly \\nserve as prospective relief.\\\" Id. at 34. These include \\ncases (like this one) when the plaintiff \\\"proved a legal \\nviolation\\\" but failed to establish or quantify compensatory damages, ibid. , \\\"as a vehicle for costs,\\\" \\nid. at 32\\u201334, or for \\\"dignitary harms,\\\" id. at 38. And \\nthese categories of cases\\u2014which alone undermine the officials' historical analysis\\u2014are just a few examples. \\nEnglish courts inferred nominal damages when-\\never the plaintiff establish ed an invasion of a legal \\nright, no matter if ther e was a continuing or \\nthreatened injury. \\\"[I]njury imports a damage, \\nthough it does not cost the party one farthing.\\\" Ashby  \\n8 \\nv. White , 92 Eng. Rep. 126, 137 (1703) (Holt, J.). \\nCourts \\\"import[ed] a dama ge\\\" for various claims, \\nincluding breach of contract, trespass, and personal \\ninjury. Ibid.  (\\\"a cuff on the ear\\\" would be actionable \\n\\\"for it is a personal injury\\\").  \\nFor personal rights, nominal damages served to \\nremedy past harms, not to  protect against future \\ninjury. In Ashby , for example, the House of Lords held \\nthat an elector who was wrongfully turned away from \\nthe polls by an official could sue without proving the \\\"possibility of a future profi t\\\" or the \\\"possibility of a \\nfuture\\\" damage. 87 Eng. Rep. 810, 810, 813 (1703) \\n(Powell, J., & Gould, J.). Often these violations occurred when an official fa iled to perform his duty \\nbut cured the defect before suit. In these cases, plain-\\ntiffs could still recover nominal damages for the past \\ninjury even though they had no need for prospective \\nrelief. E.g., Barker v. Green , 130 Eng. Rep. 327, 327 \\n(1824) (sheriff's one-day delay in arrest on writ); Bales \\nv. Wingfield , 4 Q.B. 580, n. (multi-week delay by \\nsheriff in executing a lien writ); Clifton  v. Hooper , 115 \\nEng. Rep. 175, 175, 178 (1844) (sheriff delay in exe-cuting process). This was al so true for actions brought \\nagainst private citizens. E.g., Marzetti v. Williams , \\n109 Eng. Rep. 842, 845\\u201347 (1830) (one-day delay in issuing check); Godefroy  v. Jay, 131 Eng. Rep. 159, \\n159\\u201362 (1831) (client could receive nominal damages \\nfor attorney's negligence). \\nAmerican courts followed suit. Plaintiffs could \\nrecover at least nominal damages for injuries caused \\nby public officials without showing the threat of future harm. E.g.,  Mickles v. Hart , 1 Denio 548, 550 \\n(N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1845) (sheriff deputy's delay in \\nexecuting debt); Laflin v. Willard , 33 Mass. 64, 67 \\n(1835) (same); Waterhouse v. Waite , 11 Mass. 207, 210 \\n9 \\n(1814) (same); Burns v. Erben , 26 How. Pr. 273, 277 \\n(N.Y. Super. Ct. 1864) (false imprisonment); Doherty  \\nv. Munson , 127 Mass. 495, 496 (1879) (detention \\nunder illegal warrant). And American courts routinely awarded nominal damages in private \\nactions when such an award could provide no \\nprospective relief. E.g., Thompson  v. New Orleans, J. \\n& G.N.R. Co. , 50 Miss. 315, 320 (1874) (train \\nconductor passed passenger's stop by two miles); \\nCrosby v. Humphreys , 60 N.W. 843, 844 (Minn. 1894) \\n(assault); Young v. W. Union Tel. Co. , 11 S.E. 1044, \\n1044\\u201345 (N.C. 1890) (negligent delay in delivering \\ntelegraph); McKim  v. Bartlett , 129 Mass. 226, 229 \\n(1880) (estate administrator liable for at least nomi-nal damages after court discharged future liability).  \\nThis partial list shows that early American \\ncourts\\u2014like their English counterparts\\u2014undeniably \\nawarded nominal damages so lely for past injuries. \\nAccord, e.g., U.S.Br.10\\u201311; Nat'l Right to Work Legal \\nDef. Found. Br. 4\\u201310. \\nEven a nominal-damages award in a trespass, \\nriparian-rights, or other pr operty case was intended, \\nfirst and foremost, to vindicate the past \\\"violation of \\nthe plaintiff's right.\\\" Delaware & Hudson Canal Co.  \\nv. Torrey , 33 Pa. 143, 148 (1859); accord Embrey v. \\nOwen , 155 Eng. Rep. 579, 585 (1851) (same). And that \\nis why common-law courts awarded nominal damages \\nin property cases even when the parties' future rights \\nand obligations were not at stake. E.g., Hefley  v. \\nBaker , 19 Kan. 9, 11 (1877) (pure trespass case with \\nno property-line dispute); Curtis v. Paggett , 27 P. 109, \\n109\\u201310 (Kan. 1891) (same); Cook v. Loomis , 26 Conn. \\n483, 486 (1857) (trover case where property already \\nreturned); Mears v. Cornwall , 40 N.W. 931, 932\\u201334 \\n(Mich. 1888) (same); Warder v. Baldwin , 8 N.W. 257, \\n10 \\n258 (Wis. 1881) (same); Moon v. Raphael , 132 Eng. \\nRep. 122, 122 (1835) (same). And plaintiffs at common \\nlaw could waive their right to compensatory damages \\nand choose to seek nominal damages alone. Pet.Br.42; \\naccord Daniels v. Bates , 2 Greene 151, 152 (Iowa \\n1849); Pastorius v. Fisher , 1 Rawle 27, 29 (Pa. 1828). \\nThe officials' failure to address so many of these \\ncases is no mere oversight. Many are on all fours with \\nthe constitutional violations at issue here and \\nestablish the common-law ru le that nominal damages \\nsupport a claim for past constitutional violations. So \\ndo cases involving intentional torts. Frederick \\nDouglass Found. Br. 6\\u20138 (c omparing Petitioners' \\ninjuries to those caused by intentional torts, for which \\ncourts awarded nominal damages); Stachura , 477 \\nU.S. at 306 (level of \\u00a7  1983 damages \\\"determined \\naccording to principles de rived from the common law \\nof torts\\\"). \\nThe officials say that, even if common-law courts \\nawarded nominal damages with no \\\"prospective \\nremedial benefits,\\\" such awards were meaningless \\nand insufficient \\\"for maintaining an action.\\\" Resp.Br.35\\u201336. But as detailed above, countless cases \\nheld that a standalone nominal-damages claim \\nsustained a case having no effect on future rights. It would be passing strange for so many courts, over so \\nmany years, to adjudicate  nominal-damages claims \\nthat they thought served no purpose and, in the officials' view, violated redressability requirements. \\nFinally, while early common-law courts may have \\nbeen unwilling to reverse a trial court's failure to award nominal damages in trifling or frivolous cases, \\nResp.Br.34\\u201335; Fleming  v. Gilbert , 3 Johns 528, 532 \\n(N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1808); Robertson v. Gentry , 5 Ky. 542, \\n11 \\n543 (Ct. App. 1812), that reluctance faded when \\n\\\"important\\\" rights were at stake. Blackburn v. Ala. \\nGreat S. R. Co. , 39 So. 345, 346 (Ala. 1905); Hecht  v. \\nHarrison , 40 P. 306, 309\\u201310 (Wyo. 1895). Modern \\ncourts view nominal damages the same way when a \\nplaintiff alleges a constitutional violation. E.g., Risdal \\nv. Halford , 209 F.3d 1071, 1073 (8th Cir. 2000) \\n(reversing for plain error because the district court \\nfailed to instruct the jury  to award nominal damages \\nif it found a free-speech violation); Zok v. State , 903 \\nP.2d 574, 579 (Alaska 1995) (failure to award nominal \\ndamages for unlawful arrest was plain error because \\nthe \\\"right to be free from unlawful confinement is sufficiently important and fundamental in our \\nsociety\\\"). Indeed, circuit co urts uniformly hold that an \\naward of nominal damages is mandatory upon \\nproving a constitutional violation. Pet.Br.30\\u201331 n.4 \\n(collecting cases). The officials' cramped theory of \\nnominal damages cannot explain away this history. \\nD. Nominal damages are not a mere \\nanalogue for declaratory relief. \\nNominal damages' primary purpose is to redress \\na past injury. Yet the officials continue to assert that \\n\\\"[d]eclaratory judgments are the analogue,\\\" \\nResp.Br.41, unless sovereign or qualified immunity is at stake, in which case th e officials feel differently, id. \\nat 42 n.3. The officials are incorrect. U.S.Br.23\\u201327. \\nTo be sure, \\\"all judgments of courts declare jural \\nrelations.\\\" Edwin M. Borchard, The Declaratory \\nJudgment\\u2014A Needed Procedural Reform , 28 Y\\nALE \\nL.J. 1, 4 (1918). Yet courts do not equate all forms of \\nrelief with declaratory judgments just because they share this one trait. \\n12 \\nNor do the officials rebut the many other differ-\\nences between declaratory judgments and nominal \\ndamages that unravel their flawed analogy. First, \\nnominal damages are legal relief, while declaratory judgments are equitable. Resp.Br.42 n.3. Second, \\ndeclaratory judgments were designed to determine \\nlegal rights \\\" before breach .\\\" Edwin M. Borchard, The \\nUniform Act on Declaratory Judgments , 34 H\\nARV. L. \\nREV. 697, 707 (1921). Nominal damages remedy past \\nharm, unavailable until an injury has occurred. C\\nHARLES T. MCCORMICK , HANDBOOK ON THE LAW OF \\nDAMAGES  \\u00a7 20 at 85 (1935) (\\\"Nominal damages are \\nawarded for the infraction of a legal right.\\\"). \\nThird, declaratory judgments are primarily \\nprospective relief, Christian Legal Soc'y v. Martinez , \\n561 U.S. 661, 676 n.6 (2010), while nominal damages, \\nwhich require a past violation, are primarily retro-\\nspective, Arizonans for Official English , 520 U.S. at \\n69 & n.24.   Fourth, the Declaratory Judgment Act \\n\\\"confers a discretion  on the courts,\\\" not an \\\"absolute \\nright upon the litigant.\\\" Wilton v. Seven Falls Co. , 515 \\nU.S. 277, 287 (1995). Nominal damages are manda-tory. Farrar , 506 U.S. at 112 (\\\" Carey obligate[d] a \\ncourt to award nominal damages when a plaintiff \\nestablishes the violation of his right\\\"). And finally, \\nunlike declaratory judgments,  courts have held that \\nnominal damages are subject to sovereign- and \\nqualified-immunity defenses. E.g., Am. Civil Liberties \\nUnion v. U.S. Conf. of Cath. Bishops , 705 F.3d 44, 53 \\nn.7 (1st Cir. 2013) (sovereign immunity); Hopkins v. \\nSaunders , 199 F.3d 968, 978 (8th Cir. 1999) (qualified \\nimmunity). \\nIn sum, the disparities between declaratory judg-\\nments and nominal damages are stark. And rightly \\nso, as their primary purpose is decidedly different. \\n13 \\nE. The officials' view of nominal damages \\ncontradicts Article III requirements. \\nRationalizing some of the many instances in \\nwhich common-law courts awarded nominal damages \\nfor the past violation of rights, the officials argue that \\nthe \\\"jurisdictional hook\\\" is \\\"the plaintiff's live claim \\nfor compensatory damages.\\\" Resp.Br.26. This hook saves a nominal-damages claim from mootness, say \\nthe officials, even if the plaintiff's compensatory-\\ndamages claim fail s on the merits. Ibid.  That \\nreasoning cannot be right. \\nTo begin, \\\"a plaintiff must demonstrate standing \\nfor each claim he seeks to press and for each form of relief that is sought.\\\" Town of Chester v. Laroe Ests., \\nInc., 137 S. Ct. 1645, 1650 (2017) (citation omitted). It \\nis impossible for a compensatory-damage remedy to \\nbe a \\\"jurisdictional hook\\\" for a separate, moot remedy. \\nA nominal-damages remedy mu st (and does) stand on \\nits own merits from the case's inception. \\nIn addition, \\\"an actual controversy must be extant \\nat all stages of review, not merely at the time the com-\\nplaint is filed.\\\" Arizonans for Official English , 520 \\nU.S. at 67 (citation omitted). Once a plausible claim \\nfor compensatory damages fail s at the merits stage, it \\nis again impossible for that claim to be a \\\"jurisdictional hook\\\" for a separate, moot claim. \\nMoreover, a plaintiff must quantify injury to \\nclaim compensatory damage s. Yet the loss of First \\nAmendment freedoms like speech and religious \\nexercise constitutes \\\"irreparable injury.\\\" Roman \\nCatholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , __ S. Ct. __, \\n2020 WL 6948354, at 3 (Nov. 25, 2020). Such injury \\n\\\"cannot be adequately measured or compensated by \\nmoney.\\\" Irreparable Injury , B\\nLACK 'S LAW DICTIONARY  \\n14 \\n(11th ed. 2019). The officials' position would lead to \\nthe indefensible result that the appropriate remedy \\nfor a past violation of rights is one that in some cases \\nwill not be available. \\nFinally, the officials' position deprives some \\nvictims of government misconduct of any remedy. The \\nofficials say that without plausible compensatory-damages remedies, plaintiffs can still \\\"vindicate their \\nrights through claims for prospective relief like \\ninjunctions and declaratory judgments.\\\" Resp.Br.46\\u201348. But that only underscor es the correctness of Chike \\nand Joseph's position: that eliminating the nominal-\\ndamages remedy would allo w officials to make a \\nstrategic post-filing change in policy solely to moot \\nprospective relief. Such a risk is real because \\ngovernment officials have strong incentives to moot \\ncases. Becket Fund Br. 8\\u201314; Joseph C. Davis & \\nNicholas R. Reaves, The Point Isn't Moot: How Lower \\nCourts Have Blessed Go vernment Abuse of the \\nVoluntary-Cessation Doctrine , 129 Y\\nALE L.J.  FORUM  \\n325 (2019). The officials propose a phantom remedy to \\ninsulate their unconstitutional acts from legal accountability. \\n  \\n15 \\nII. The officials' reasons for creating a nominal-\\ndamages exception to Article III are indefensible. \\nThe officials predict dire  effects if this Court \\nallows partial redress for the violation of Chike and \\nJoseph's rights. Yet it ha s been \\\"widely recognized\\\" \\nfor ages \\\"that a claim for nominal damages precludes mootness\\\" based on later events. N.Y. State Rifle & \\nPistol Ass'n v. City of N.Y. , 140 S. Ct. 1525, 1536 \\n(2020) (Alito, J., dissenting); Pet.Br.14 n.2 (catalog-uing eight circuits' rule). None of these asserted \\nconsequences have material ized in the jurisdictions \\nthat have rejected the Eleventh Circuit's novel and indefensible approach. The officials' arguments lack \\nmerit. \\nA. The majority rule does not require \\nadvisory opinions. \\nThe officials say that nominal-damages claims \\ninvite advisory opinions. Resp.Br. 2, 9\\u201310, 22, 41\\u201342. Not so. To quote the officials' own cases, advisory opinions \\\"advis[e] what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\\\" Aetna Life Ins. Co. of \\nHartford v. Haworth , 300 U.S. 227, 241 (1937). \\nAccord, e.g., Preiser v. Newkirk , 422 U.S. 395, 401 \\n(1975) (same);  Ashcroft v. Mattis , 431 U.S. 171, 172 \\n(1977) (per curiam). That's not the request here. \\nChike and Joseph present real-world facts and \\n\\\"concrete legal issues, presented in [an] actual case[  ],\\\" \\nGolden v. Zwickler , 394 U.S. 103, 108 (1969): whether \\nofficials violated their free -speech rights. It is not \\nclear why the officials believe that question is more hypothetical here than if Chike's speech had con-sumed 1\\u00a2 of chalk, particularly when the officials do \\n16 \\nnot contest he suffered a cognizable injury-in-fact. \\nThere is nothing advisory about deciding the question \\nand awarding nominal damages. Young Ams. for \\nLiberty Br. 12; Christia n Legal Soc'y Br. 5\\u20136. \\nB. The majority rule does not eliminate the \\nmootness doctrine. \\nThe longstanding majority rule has not \\\"swal-\\nlowed\\\" the mootness doctrine in the eight circuits that \\nfollow it. Contra Resp.Br.43\\u201345. Many constitutional \\ncases seek only prospectiv e relief, either because \\ndamages are barred by sovereign immunity or because the injury is threatened or imminent but has not yet occurred at the time of filing. The mootness doctrine is alive and well for those cases. The \\nsituation here\\u2014where the officials already violated \\nChike's and Joseph's constitutional rights\\u2014presents \\nthe flip side of mootness: fed eral courts are obligated \\nto adjudicate live controversies. Knox v. Serv. Emps. \\nInt'l Union, Local 1000 , 567 U.S. 298, 307\\u201308 (2012). \\nPlus, the officials' concer n for the vitality of the \\nmootness doctrine is selective. They concede that the \\ndoctrine has not crumbled ev en though a plaintiff can \\navoid mootness by seeking compensation for negli-gible financial damages. Resp.Br.49. So, it will not disintegrate if a plaintiff seeks justice without putting \\nhimself and the courts through the trouble and \\ndisproportionate expense of monetizing, proving, and \\nassessing those injuries, as long experience in the courts of appeals attests. Ar ticle III does not require \\nplaintiffs to repackage no minal-damages claims as \\nsmall damages claims. Both types of claims ensure a \\nlive controversy. \\n17 \\nFar more troublesome problems arise under the \\nofficials' rule, which allows governments to moot \\ncases unilaterally and strategically. That approach \\nallows officials to reinstate unconstitutional policies, a phenomenon that the amici have well documented. \\nFIRE Br. 24\\u201327; Becket Fund Br. 10\\u201314; Just. & Free-\\ndom Fund Br. 9, 15\\u201316 & n.4. It creates incentives for officials to run out the clock on many claims, e.g., \\ndelaying until students gr aduate, or prisoners get \\ntransferred. Islam & Religious Freedom Br. 14\\u201315; Inst. for Free Speech Br. 14\\u20131 5; Becket Fund Br. 23\\u2013\\n25; Christian Legal Soc'y Br. 15\\u201317; FIRE Br. 5\\u20137. \\nIn short, the officials' mootness-related policy \\nconcerns do not justify their invitation to jettison the \\nmajority rule and create a nominal-damages excep-\\ntion to Article III. \\nC. The majority rule neither wastes judicial \\nresources nor prolongs cases.  \\nThe officials and their amici say that the enduring \\nmajority rule wastes judicial resources, prolongs \\nlawsuits, and increases attorney fees. Resp.Br.45; \\nD.C.Br. 13\\u201321. But government officials who quickly and \\\"reasonably respond\\\" when initially alerted to an unconstitutional policy, D.C.Br. 4\\u201311, rarely face protracted litigation. \\nConsider what happened here. Three years before \\nChike tried to speak on campus\\u2014in 2013 \\u2014counsel \\ninformed Georgia Gwinnett officials that their poli-cies were unconstitutional. Pet.App.89a\\u201390a. The of-ficials did nothing. Chike questioned the overbreadth and inconsistency of the officia ls' policies when he was \\nordered to stop speaking in 2016. Id. at 100a\\u201302a. \\nAgain, officials did nothing. When Chike filed suit in \\n18 \\nDecember 2016, the officials did not recant; they dou-\\nbled down, insisting that sharing the Christian faith \\n\\\"arguably rose to the level of 'fighting words'\\\" that the \\nFirst Amendment does not protect. Id. at 155a. \\nIt was not until much later in the case that the \\nofficials changed their unconstitutional policies and then promptly moved to dismiss. Id. at 160a. Imagine \\nhow much litigation and how many constitutional \\ndeprivations the officials could have avoided simply \\nby \\\"reasonably responding\\\" in 2013. \\nThe reality is officials oft en stubbornly refuse to \\nconcede that they have vi olated someone's constitu-\\ntional rights. E.g., N.Y. State Rifle & Pistol Ass'n , 140 \\nS. Ct. at 1538\\u201339 (Alito, J., dissenting) (city fought the \\nplaintiffs' Second Amendment rights \\\"tooth and nail\\\" \\nin lower courts, then strategically changed policy to \\n\\\"moot\\\" the case on the eve of oral argument in this Court). The amici briefs are replete with such examples. E.g., Becket Fund Br. 3 (prison changed \\npolicy \\\"[t]wo weeks before oral argument\\\"); \\nCatholicVote.org Br. 12 n.4 (city repealed ordinance \\n\\\"years into litigation\\\" an d \\\"days\\\" after grant of en \\nbanc review); Pacific Legal Found. Br. 1\\u20132 (city repealed ban \\\"[o]n the eve of oral argument\\\"); FIRE Br. 7 (universities \\\"disavow[  ]\\\" policies \\\"after the \\nstart of litigation\\\"). And though the District of \\nColumbia amici say the Eleventh Circuit's rule \\n\\\"incentivizes government actors to revisit challenged laws,\\\" the brief's listed examples all come from outside the Eleventh Circuit. D.C.Br. 4\\u201311. Indeed, the officials here changed their policies several months before  the Eleventh Circuit adopted its outlier \\nrule, further proving that the majority rule already \\nencourages officials to do the right thing. \\n19 \\nConversely, the longstanding rule does not \\nencourage plaintiffs to pursue pointless litigation \\nsimply to inflict an attorn ey-fee award. This \\\"Court's \\ndecision not to grant fees in Farrar was born of its \\nreluctance to reward attorneys for bringing less than \\nmeritorious claims that see k, but fail to obtain, large \\nmonetary judgments or fail to promote a larger public good.\\\" Project Vote/Voting for Am., Inc.  v. Dickerson , \\n444 F. App'x 660, 664 (4th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) \\n(citing Farrar , 506 U.S. at 116). The same will be true \\nin cases brought simply to harass. But a meritorious \\ncivil-rights claim brought to stop unconstitutional government conduct \\\"is the very form of litigation Congress wished to encourage by enacting \\u00a7  1988.\\\" \\nIbid.  (citing Daly v. Hill, 790 F.2d 1071, 1084 (4th Cir. \\n1986)). Accord, e.g., Fox v. Vice, 563 U.S. 826, 832\\u201333 \\n(2011) (characterizing a successful \\u00a7 1983 plaintiff pursuing \\u00a7 1988 fees as \\\"a private attorney general\\\") (citation omitted). \\\"Deterring meritorious lawsuits on constitutional issues because they offer a small \\nlikelihood of a significant money judgment presents \\nas grave a danger to our legal system as frivolous litigation.\\\" Project Vote , F. App'x at 664\\u201365 (quoting \\nKoopman v. Water Dist. No. 1 of Johnson Cnty. , 41 \\nF.3d 1417, 1421 (10th Cir. 1994)). Accord Rutherford Inst. Br. 7\\u201312 (discussing implications of tactical \\nmooting).  \\nIt's not even clear that following the majority rule \\nwould appreciably increase caseloads. The officials \\nhave provided no evidence that the circuits applying \\nthe majority rule have been overwhelmed with nominal-damages cases. Contra Inst. for Free Speech \\nBr. 16\\u201317 n.11 (statistics showing the opposite). In \\nthe long run, reaching the merits conserves judicial \\n20 \\nresources by produc ing precedent that obviates future \\ndisputes\\u2014sometimes on precisely the same issue,  \\nwhere unconstitutional policies are reinstated after a \\ncase has been strategically mooted. Id. at 17; The \\nPoint Isn't Moot , 129 Y ALE L.J.  FORUM  at 338\\u201341. \\nFinally, the most effective way to minimize \\nconstitutional violations is to hold recalcitrant officials accountable, not to deny victims the remedy \\nArticle III allows. Just. & Freedom Fund Br. 17\\u201318; \\ncontra Br. of Nat'l Conf. of State Legislatures 23\\u201324. When, as here, a prospective plaintiff sends government officials a warning letter, alerting them to unconstitutional conduct, the potential negative consequences of a future judgment, see Br. of Nat'l \\nConf. of State Legislatures 23\\u201324, are precisely what \\nmotivate the officials to change course. Officials who \\nknow they can violate constitutional rights without cost have no incentive to stop violating the Constitution. \\nIn sum, allowing the gove rnment to unilaterally \\nmoot claims for past consti tutional violations would \\nundermine the vindication of constitutional rights \\nand the Constitution itself. After all, courts are the \\\"department of the government to whom the protection of the rights of the individual is by the \\nconstitution especially confided.\\\" 1\\n ST. GEORGE \\nTUCKER , BLACKSTONE 'S COMMENTARIES , App. 357 \\n(1803). Prohibiting the government from doing so would not change the prevailing legal landscape. \\n  \\n21 \\nIII. The officials' rule would leave plaintiffs \\nwithout a remedy and result in more violations of constitutional rights.  \\nAbandoning the majority rule would leave some \\nvictims of constitutional violations without a remedy. \\nEquitable relief is often unavailable or easily mooted \\n(as shown here), and constitutional violations often do not cause quantifiable harm. Pet.Br.37; FIRE Br. 5\\u20139. The officials fail to meaningfully engage these points. \\nThe officials first insist that these claims \\\"can \\noften be adjudicated\\\" via \\\"prospective relief.\\\" \\nResp.Br.46. But \\\"can often\\\" means \\\"not always,\\\" since such relief is available only when the illegal conduct \\\"might happen again.\\\" Ibid. Those mistreated under \\na later-repealed policy or  subjected to \\\"one-off\\\" \\nviolations have no such reme dy. This gives officials at \\nleast one \\\"free pass\\\" to violate the Constitution.   \\nSuch a rule also artificia lly constricts the judici-\\nary's ability and duty to protect individual rights \\nbased on an unsupported as surance that officials will \\nuse this leeway altruistic ally and correct mistakes \\nquickly. Perhaps the offic ials' suggested approach \\nwould work if we were governed by angels rather than \\nmere \\\"men.\\\" T\\nHE FEDERALIST NO. 51, at 322 (James \\nMadison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961). But amici \\nrecount myriad experiences demonstrating that the judiciary serves as an important check-and-balance. \\nWorse, civil-rights litigants already face daunting \\nterrain:  persuading attorn eys to pro bono represent \\nthem, exhausting administrative remedies, and surviving immunity, which shields all but those who \\ndefy clearly established law. And at least six circuits \\n22 \\nhave even lowered the burden on officials to show a \\ncase is moot. The Point Isn't Moot , 129 Y ALE L.J.  \\nFORUM  at 333, n.50. The Eleventh Circuit, like others, \\ngives government officials \\\"considerably more leeway \\nthan private parties in the presumption that they are \\nunlikely to resume illegal activities.\\\" Coral Springs \\nSt. Sys., Inc.  v. City of Sunrise , 371 F.3d 1320, 1328\\u2013\\n29 (11th Cir. 2004). \\nThis flipped burden forces plaintiffs to prove\\u2014\\nusually with no discovery\\u2014that officials will revert to \\nthe original policy. Yet officials are \\\"more likely to strategically moot cases, not less\\\" than private defendants. The Point Isn't Moot , 129 Y\\nALE L.J.  \\nFORUM  at 335. Accord Becket Fund Br. 8\\u201314; FIRE \\nBr. 24\\u201328; CAIR Br. 15\\u201317. \\nFor \\\"one-off\\\" violations, the officials insist the \\nremedy is compensation. Resp.Br.49\\u201352. But again, this helps only those who ha ve suffered quantifiable \\nharm. And examples abound of constitutional injuries \\nthat often are not compens able, including unlawful \\nentry of private residences, denial of kosher meals in \\nprison, zoning restrictions on religious institutions, door-to-door proselytizin g restrictions, and free \\nspeech claims on campus\\u2014all examples that would transform difficulty pr oving damages into a \\njurisdictional bar. Hudson  v. Michigan , 547 U.S. 586, \\n610 (2006) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (\\\"the majority, like \\nMichigan and the United States, has failed to cite a single reported case in which a plaintiff has collected more than nominal damages solely as a result of a knock-and-announce violation\\\"); Just. & Freedom Fund Br. 5 n.2; CatholicVote .org Br. 16; ACLU Br. \\n17\\u201318; Islam & Religious Freedom Br. 8\\u20139; Becket \\nFund Br. 20\\u201325; Seventh- Day Adventists Br. 20. \\n23 \\nPlus, some religiously motivated plaintiffs only \\nwant justice or are reluctant to seek money damages \\nfor theological reasons. It's a perverse incentive to \\nforce  such plaintiffs to demand compensatory \\ndamages they do not want or need. \\nNor are compensatory damages for intangible \\ninjuries a cure-all. Many circuits require plaintiffs to prove those injuries without relying on their \\nsubjective testimony, and statutes and immunities \\nimpose more hurdles. Becket Fund Br. 15\\u201318. In these and other civil rights ca ses, plaintiffs steer clear \\nof compensatory damages because \\\"causation and quantification of damages are burdensome to litigate,\\\" \\\"there is little prospect of substantial \\nrecovery,\\\" and these clai ms \\\"profoundly irritate[  ] the \\njudge.\\\" Douglas Laycock, The Triumph of Equity , 56 \\nL.\\n & CONTEMP . PROBS . 53, 63 (1993). Discarding the \\nmajority rule on nominal damages leaves no remedy for those plaintiffs who do not have monetizable harm, rendering their rights unenforceable and \\neffectively nonexistent. \\nIf the Court creates an artificial jurisdictional bar \\nthat renders rights unenforceable in certain circum-stances, it is not difficult to predict that more viola-\\ntions of constitutional rights will follow. As this Court \\nhas already recognized, nominal-damages awards \\nensure that constitutional  rights are \\\"scrupulously \\nobserved.\\\" Carey , 435 U.S. at 266. Excluding such \\nawards from Article III would guarantee the opposite outcome. Although this problem extends to many backdrops, the context presented here\\u2014free speech on public college and university campuses\\u2014provides \\na stark illustration. \\n24 \\nNearly 90% of public, postsecondary institutions \\nmaintain policies that severely restrict protected \\nspeech or could be applied to do so. FIRE Br. 14\\u201323. \\nMany of these policies ar e vague and overbroad, \\nincluding granting officials unfettered discretion to \\nsilence and punish, or prohibiting offensive expres-\\nsion based on third-party perceptions ( i.e., heckler \\nvetoes). \\nGiven that evidence, there is a real risk that a \\nnew rule disallowing standalone nominal-damages claims would lead university officials to strategically moot controversies after  a student's rights are \\nviolated. Doubling down on constitutional depriva-tions would inevitably extend off campus to other \\ngovernment officials, endangering not just free speech \\nand religious exercise, but also Second Amendment \\nrights, the right to be free from illegal searches, unlawful detentions, and many others. \\nA constitutional right that cannot be enforced is \\nno right at all. This Court should say so and reverse.  \\n \\n25\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_args\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sections_alt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 354,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/16-1150.html\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"arg_structure\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

      " Attempting to avoid this Court 's review, \n",
      "Respondents claim the opinion below is consistent \n",
      "with precedent and narrowly prohibits the State of \n",
      "Washington from \"destroying \" salmon fisheries and \n",
      "abrogating treaty rights. These claims cannot \n",
      "withstand scrutiny.  \n",
      " The Ninth Circuit opinion is not a narrow \n",
      "restriction on \"destroying \" salmon runs. If it were, \n",
      "Washington would not have sought certiorari. Salmon \n",
      "are vital to our Sta te's people, culture, and economy. \n",
      "In reality, the panel held that the Treaties make a \n",
      "promise beyond the State 's control: \"that the number \n",
      "of fish would always be sufficient to provide a \n",
      "'moderate living ' to the Tribes. \" Pet. App. 94a. This \n",
      "Court rejected  that unworkable rule in Washington v. \n",
      "Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing \n",
      "Vessel Ass 'n, 443 U.S. 658 (1979)  (Fishing Vessel ). \n",
      " Respondents similarly err in claiming that \n",
      "Washington 's equitable defenses would abrogate \n",
      "treaty rights. As this Court recognized in City of \n",
      "Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation , 544 U.S. 197, 213 \n",
      "(2005) , equitable defenses address what relief is \n",
      "available, not what rights exist. And as this Court and \n",
      "the Second Circuit have recognized, such defenses are \n",
      "available in treaty cases. The Ninth Circuit disagreed, \n",
      "rejectin g these holdings and the powerful equities \n",
      "here, where the federal government designed and \n",
      "granted permits for the very culverts it now claims \n",
      "violate tr eaties it signed 160 years ago.  \n",
      " Finally, Respondents ' attempt to reconcile the \n",
      "injunction here with pr ecedent fails. Respondents \n",
      "cannot dispute that the injunction requires the State \n",
      "2 \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      " to replace many culverts that will make no difference, \n",
      "flying in the  face of federalism principles.  \n",
      " The Court should grant certiorari.  \n",
      "I. Respondents Mischaracterize the Ninth \n",
      "Circuit's Opinion  \n",
      " To minimize the conflict with Fishing  Vessel  \n",
      "and the importance of this case, Respondents \n",
      "mischaracterize the Ninth Circuit 's opinion in two \n",
      "crucial respects.  \n",
      " First, Respondents claim that the Ninth \n",
      "Circuit 's opinion narrowly \"addressed whether the \n",
      "Treaties place any limits on the State 's ability to \n",
      "destroy the fisheries that form the Treaty res, and \n",
      "held that they do. \" Tribes BIO at 17; id. at 18; U.S. \n",
      "BIO at 14. If that were all that the panel held, this \n",
      "case would be as unimportant as Respondents claim. \n",
      "Indeed, the Ninth Circuit held 40 years ago that \n",
      "\"neither the treaty Indians nor the state on behalf of \n",
      "its citizens may permit the subject matter of these \n",
      "treaties to be destroyed. \" United States v. Wash ington, \n",
      "520 F.2d 676, 685 (9th Cir. 1975) . The State has made \n",
      "clear that it has no objection to that rule. Ninth \n",

      "o.php?pk_vid=0000008307 . \n",
      " But that is not what the Ninth Circuit held. It \n",
      "held that the Treaties \"promise that the number of \n",
      "fish would always be sufficient to provide a 'moderate \n",
      "living ' to the Tribes. \" Pet. App. 94a; U.S. BIO at 13 \n",
      "(admitting that the panel held that Washington \n",
      "\"violates the treaty fishing right by interfering with \n",
      "the Tribes ' ability to ensure a moderate living \"). \n",
      "3 \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "  There are crucial differences between what \n",
      "Respondents claim the Ninth Circuit held (a \n",
      "guarantee against fishery destruction) and what it \n",
      "actually held (a guaranteed moderate living). Most \n",
      "importantly, as detailed below, an anti -destruction \n",
      "principle could be reconciled with Fishing  Vessel , \n",
      "while the modera te-living guarantee cannot. An anti -\n",
      "destruction rule would also lead to a very different \n",
      "test for treaty violation from the one the courts below \n",
      "applied. Rather than simply concluding that Tribes \n",
      "are not earning a moderate living from fishing and \n",
      "that culv erts play some unknown part in that, the \n",
      "courts below would have needed to consider whether \n",

      "[{\"I. Respondents Mischaracterize the Ninth Circuit's Opinion\": 'To minimize the conflict with Fishing  Vessel  \\nand the importance of this case, Respondents \\nmischaracterize the Ninth Circuit \\'s opinion in two \\ncrucial respects.  \\n First, Respondents claim that the Ninth \\nCircuit \\'s opinion narrowly \"addressed whether the \\nTreaties place any limits on the State \\'s ability to \\ndestroy the fisheries that form the Treaty res, and \\nheld that they do. \" Tribes BIO at 17; id. at 18; U.S. \\nBIO at 14. If that were all that the panel held, this \\ncase would be as unimportant as Respondents claim. \\nIndeed, the Ninth Circuit held 40 years ago that \\n\"neither the treaty Indians nor the state on behalf of \\nits citizens may permit the subject matter of these \\ntreaties to be destroyed. \" United States v. Wash ington, \\n520 F.2d 676, 685 (9th Cir. 1975) . The State has made \\nclear that it has no objection to that rule. Ninth \\nCircuit Oral Argument at 50:20 to 51:10  (Oct. 16, \\n2015), http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/media/view_vide  \\no.php?pk_vid=0000008307 . \\n But that is not what the Ninth Circuit held. It \\nheld that the Treaties \"promise that the number of \\nfish would always be sufficient to provide a \\'moderate \\nliving \\' to the Tribes. \" Pet. App. 94a; U.S. BIO at 13 \\n(admitting that the panel held that Washington \\n\"violates the treaty fishing right by interfering with \\nthe Tribes \\' ability to ensure a moderate living \"). \\n3 \\n \\n \\n  There are crucial differences between what \\nRespondents claim the Ninth Circuit held (a \\nguarantee against fishery destruction) and what it \\nactually held (a guaranteed moderate living). Most \\nimportantly, as detailed below, an anti -destruction \\nprinciple could be reconciled with Fishing  Vessel , \\nwhile the modera te-living guarantee cannot. An anti -\\ndestruction rule would also lead to a very different \\ntest for treaty violation from the one the courts below \\napplied. Rather than simply concluding that Tribes \\nare not earning a moderate living from fishing and \\nthat culv erts play some unknown part in that, the \\ncourts below would have needed to consider whether \\nthe State destroyed the salmon fishery or particular \\nsalmon runs by building culverts, given factors like: \\n(1) the State built culverts to standards that the \\nfedera l government said were sufficient to allow \\nstreams to pass through and comply with federal law; \\n(2) Respondents \\' highest estimate of salmon affected \\nby state culverts (200,000) is a small fraction of \\nannual harvests even in recent times (e.g., less than \\n5% of the 4 million salmon harvested in 2003, ER 267), \\nand an even smaller percentage of historic harvests; \\n(3) state culverts are vastly outnumbered by non -\\nState culverts, including federal culverts, Pet. App. \\n203a, ER 196 -209, 407 -555; and (4) salmon runs had \\ndeclined dramatically long before the State built any \\nculverts, see, e.g. , Vail v. Seaborg , 207 P. 15, 16 (Wash. \\n1922)  (\"It is a well -known fact that the salmon \\nindustry of the state is r apidly disappearing.\") . \\n Respondents \\' second mischaracterization is \\nthat the Ninth Circuit \\'s opinion makes clear that it \\naddresses only culverts, so it will not have the far -\\nreaching impacts the State and amici describe. See, \\n4 \\n \\n \\n e.g., Tribes BIO at 36 ( \"[T]he  Court of Appeals could \\nnot have been clearer about the narrow scope of its \\ndecision[.] \"); U.S. BIO at 13 -14, 19 -20. But every \\npassage Respondents cite to support this proposition \\ncomes from the concurrence in denial of rehearing en \\nbanc authored by two pa nel members —not the \\nopinion. See, e.g. , Tribes BIO at 36 (citing Pet. App. \\n10a-11a); U.S. BIO at 13 -14 (citing Pet. App. 10a -11a); \\nU.S. BIO at 20 (citing Pet. App. 11a -12a). And when \\nRespondents or others file the next case based on the \\npanel \\'s opinion, th ey will surely argue that the \\nconcurrence in denial of rehearing \"is not a means by \\nwhich [the Ninth Circuit] can definitively speak on \\nlegal questions. \" Hughes v. Kisela , 862 F.3d 775, 797 \\n(9th Cir. 2016), as amended  (June 27, 2017)  (Ikuta, J., \\ndissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (citing \\nEEOC v. Bass Pro Outdoor World, LLC , 865 F.3d 216, \\n234 (5th Cir. 2017) (Jones, J., dissenting from denial  \\nof rehearing en banc) ( \"[T]he panel has only the right \\nto comment on the dissent from denial, not to \\narticulate any additional binding precedent. \"); Young \\nv. Borders , 850 F.3d 1274, 1287 (11th Cir. 2017)  (Hull, \\nJ., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc) \\n(\"[O]rders denying rehearing en banc, even this \\npublished one, have no binding or precedential \\nvalue. \"). \\n The panel could have amended its opinion to \\naddress the concerns of the State and the dissent that \\nthe opinion contained no  \"limiting legal principle that \\nwill prevent its holding from being used to attack a \\nvariety of development, construction, and farming \\npractices . . . throughout the Pacific Northwest. \" Pet. \\nApp. 19a.  The panel chose not to do that (despite \\nmaking other amendments on rehearing), instead \\n5 \\n \\n \\n issuing a concurrence in the denial of rehearing en \\nbanc. The Court should see through the panel \\'s (and \\nRespondents \\') efforts to downplay the opinion \\'s scope.  \\n Subsequent ev ents support the State \\'s concern \\nabout the opinion \\'s breadth and the need for this \\nCourt \\'s review. For example, the EPA \"cited the Ninth \\nCircuit culvert decision as a basis for disapproving \\nsome of Washington State \\'s water quality standards \\nunder the Clean  Water Act \" and Maine \\'s water quality \\nstandards.1 And the commission that  regulates land \\nuse in the Columbia River Gorge under 16 U.S.C.  \\n§§ 544 -544p , relied on the panel decision to uphold  the \\ndenial of a railroad \\'s land -use permit  in Oregon .2 \\n In short, Respondents \\' attempts to narrow the \\nopinion ring hollow, failing to undermine the \\nexceptional importance of this case.'}, {'II. The Conflict with Fishing Vessel Is Real': 'The Ninth Circuit ruled tha t the Treaties \\n\"promise that the number of fish would always  \\nbe sufficient to provide a \\'moderate living \\' to the \\nTribes. \" Pet. App. 94a.  This is irreconcilable with \\nFishing  Vessel , which specifically rejected the  \\nTribes \\' argument \"that the treaties had reserved a \\npre-existing right to as many fish as their commercial \\n                                            \\n1 Conference of Western Attorneys General, American \\nIndian Law Deskbook  § 9:18, 674 -76 & nn.28, 31 -32 (2017) . \\n2 Union Pac. R.R. Co. v. Wasco County B d. of Comm\\'rs , \\nNo. COA -16-01, at 32 -47 (Columbia River Gorge Comm\\'n  \\nSept. 8, 2017), http://www.gorgecommission.org/images/up  \\nloads/app eals/20170908_Final_Opinion_and_Order_%2816 -01% \\n2C_16 -02_%28Consolidated%29%29.pdf, appeal docketed ,  \\nNo. A166300 (Or. Ct . App. Nov. 7, 2017) . \\n6 \\n \\n \\n and subsistence n eeds dictated. \" Fishing Vessel , 443 \\nU.S. at 670.  \\n To avoid the conflict, Respondents first rewrite \\nFishing  Vessel . They claim the Court  recognized a \\n\"right \" to as many fish as the Tribes need for a \\nmoderate living, subject to a \"ceiling \" of 50% of the \\navailable  fish. U.S. BIO at 13 ; Tribes BIO at 19 -20. \\nThis reverses the opinion and conflates the right with \\nthe remedy . Fishing Vessel declared \"a right , secured \\nby treaty, to take a fair share of the available fish .\" \\nFishing Vessel , 443 U.S. at 684 -85 (emphasis added). \\nThe Court then turned to the remedy, affirming an \\nequitabl e apportionment of 50% of the catch to the \\nTribes unless \"tribal needs may be satisfied by a lesser \\namount. \" Id. at 685 -86. Thus, rather than declaring a \\nright to a \"moderate living, \" the Court declared a right \\nto a fair share, capped at 50%. If a lesser share were \\nsufficient to \"provide the Indians with a livelihood —\\nthat is to say, a moderate living ,\" their share could be \\nreduced. Id. at 686 -87. Thus, as the Tribes themselves \\nadmit, Fishing Vessel  used the moderate living \\n\"standard to bound the tribal share \" of the catch, not \\nto declare a minimum guarantee . Tribes BI O at 20.  \\nBy contrast , \"the panel opinion turns Fishing Vessel  \\non its head \" by \"impos[ing] an affirmative duty upon \\nthe State to provide a certain quantity of fish[.] \"  \\nPet. App. 24a.  \\n Next, Respondents claim that the panel needed \\nto read Fishing  Vessel  to guarantee a moderate living \\nbecause otherwise the State could \"entirely eliminate \\nthe supply of harvestable salmon. \" U.S. BIO at 14 \\n(quoting Fletcher, J., concurring in the denial of \\nrehearing en banc, Pet. App. 9a). Judge O \\'Scannlain \\nproperly described this theory as \"utter nonsense. \" \\n7 \\n \\n \\n Pet. App. 28a. Courts have equitable powers to protect \\nthe shared salmon fishery from waste, overfishing, or \\ndestruction. See Fishing Vessel , 443 U.S. at 692 n.32; \\nUnited States v. Wash ington , 52 0 F.2d at 685 \\n(\"[N]either the treaty Indians nor the state on behalf \\nof its citizens may permit the subject matter of these \\ntreaties to be destroyed. \"); United States v. Oregon , \\n657 F.2d 1009, 1015 -16 (9 th Cir. 1981) . Countless \\nother state and federal laws protect salmon, and the \\nState has strong incentives to preserve and restore \\nsalmon runs to benefit all Washingtonians, evidenced \\nby the State \\'s voluntary expenditure of hundreds of \\nmillions  of dollars on salmon recovery.  \\n The Tribes also claim there is no conflict \\nbecause Fishing Vessel  left \"open \" \"whether the \\nTreaties place any limits on the State \\'s ability to \\ndestroy the treaty fisheries. \" Tribes  BIO at 18 . It is \\ntrue that Fishing  Vessel  did not specifically address \\nthat question. But the Ninth Circuit \\'s holding is not \\nlimited to that question. The court held the Treaties  \\n\"promise that the number of fish would always be \\nsufficie nt to provide a \\'moderate living \\' to the Tribes. \" \\nPet. App. 94a.  That  rationale is irreconcilable with \\nFishing  Vessel , which rejected that very principle. Cf. \\nSeminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida , 517 U.S. 44, 67  \\n(1996)  (\"When an opinion issues for the Court, it is not \\nonly the result but also those portions of the opinion \\nnecessary to that result by which we are bound. \").'}, {\"III. The Ninth Circuit's Rejection of Equitable Defenses in Treaty Cases Creates a Real Conflict\": 'Despite this Court \\'s holding in City of Sherrill  \\nv. Oneida Indian Nation, 544 U.S. 197 (2005) \\n8 \\n \\n \\n (Sherrill ), that equitable defenses are available to \\ntreaty claims, the Ninth Circuit adhered to its own \\nprior precedent holding the opposite. Pet. App. 97a-\\n98a. Respondents fail in their attempts to distinguish \\nSherrill  and Second Circuit cases applying it.  \\n Respo ndents first argue that equitable \\ndefenses cannot be available to treaty claims because \\nonly Congress can abrogate treaty rights. U .S. BIO at \\n21; Trib es BIO at 26. But equitable defenses do not \\nabrogate treaty rights. As this Court explained in \\nSherrill , equitable defenses are rooted in the idea that \\neven if a right exists, the remedies available may be \\nlimited.  Sherrill , 544 U.S. at 213. And Sherrill  and \\nsubsequent Second Circuit cases have applied \\nequitable defenses to bar analogous tr eaty claims.  \\n Next, Respondents claim Sherrill is \\ndistinguishable because it did not address \"specific \\nrights \" created by Treaties. U.S. BIO at 22. Not so. \\nThe tribe \\'s claim in that case was that it was exempt \\nfrom tax on property within its  \"reservation s et aside \\nby the 1794 Canandaigua Treaty .\" Sherrill , 544 U.S. \\nat 212; see also id.  at 203 -05. Although it was \\nundisputed that the land at issue was within the \\ntreaty reservation, the Court held that equitable \\nconsiderations barred the tribe \\'s claim. Id. at 213-20. \\n Respondents also point out that the federal \\ngovernment was not a party to Sherrill . Tribes BIO at \\n27; U.S. BIO at 22. But Respondents never explain \\nwhy this matters, especially given that the United \\nStates appeared as amicus in  Sherrill  to support the \\ntribe. Nor does this lessen the circuit conflict —the \\nUnited States was party to Second Circuit cases \\napplying equitable defenses. See Oneida Indian \\n9 \\n \\n \\n Nation v. Cty. of Oneida , 617 F.3d 114 (2d Cir. 2010), \\ncert. denied , 565 U.S. 970 ( 2011) ; Cayuga Indian \\nNation v. Pataki , 413 F.3d 266 (2d Cir. 2005), cert. \\ndenied , 547 U.S. 1128 (2006) . \\n Next, Respondents assert that this case differs \\nfactually from Sherrill and the Second Circuit cases, \\nwhich involved \"long-moribund sovereignty \" over land \\nheld by others. U.S. BIO at 22 -23; Tribes BIO at 27. \\nBut these arguments go to whether the State \\'s \\nequitable defenses should prevail on the merits, not \\nwhether the State can raise these defenses at all. \\nHere, the district court dismissed the State \\'s defenses \\nas a matter of law at the pleading stage, Pet. App. \\n273a -74a, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed that \\ndecision, creating a clear conflict.  \\n These factual distinctions are also weak. \\nSherrill  and the Second Circuit cases all involved  \\nclaims within a tribe \\'s historic reservation lands.  \\nSherrill , 544 U.S. at 212; Oneida  Indian Nation , 617 \\nF.3d at 119.  By contrast, Respondents here seek to \\nregulate State actions outside of reservations in  \\nareas wher e the Tribes \"cede[d], relinquish[ed], and \\nconvey[ed] . . . all their right, title, and interest in and \\nto the lands. \" Treaty with the Nisqualli, Puyallup Etc. \\n1854 (Medicine Creek Treaty), arts. I, III, 10 Stat. \\n1132, 1133 (Dec. 26, 1854, ratified Mar. 3, 1855, \\nproclaimed Apr. 10, 1855) . If anything, such claims \\nthreaten to be more disruptive than claims to \\nreservation lands. And if equity can limit a treaty \\nclaim to reservation l and itself, surely it can limit \\nother typ es of claims.  \\n Finally, Respondents claim that  this case \\ndiffers bec ause the T reaties here have been the \\n10 \\n \\n \\n subject of litigation for over a century. But the same \\nwas true in Sherrill , where litigation seeking \\ncompensa tion for the t ribe\\'s lost land began in 1893.  \\nSherrill , 544 U.S. at 207. And the history of litigation \\nover these Treaties actually supports the availability \\nof equitable defenses here. At least since United \\nStates v. Winans , 198 U.S. 3 71 (1905) , and throughout \\nsubsequent decades, the federal government has \\nbrought many cases to enforce the Stevens Treaties. \\nYet at the exact same time , the federal government \\nwas enco uraging and funding Washington \\'s highway \\nconstruction and directing the State \\'s culvert design.3 \\nEven after this case was filed in 1970, the federal \\ngovernment continued to issue permits for culverts in \\nWashington, saying that they complied with federal \\nlaw. ER 990.  Given that the federal government  \\nspent decades suing to enforce the Treaties while \\nsimultaneously providing the design and permits for \\nthe State \\'s culverts, the State \\'s reliance interests are \\nclear. Cf. Sherrill , 544 U.S. at  217 ( \"It is well \\nestablished that laches, a doctrine focused on one \\nside\\'s inaction and the other \\'s legitimate reliance, may \\nbar long -dormant claims for equitable relief. \").'}, {\"IV. The Injunction is Irreconcilable with This Court's Precedent\": 'The United States c laims that normal \\nprinciples of injunctive relief —that injunctions be \\nnarrowly tailored to redress only conduct that violates \\n                                            \\n3 The federal government was also building dams in \\nareas covered by the Treaties that completely or partially blocked \\nsalmon runs. See, e.g. , Wild Fish Conservancy  v. Salazar , 628 \\nF.3d 513, 516 -17 (9 th Cir. 2010) ; Idaho ex rel. Evans v. Oregon , \\n462 U.S. 1017, 1020 -21 & nn. 2-5 (1983) . \\n11 \\n \\n \\n federal law, issued only after considering public \\nimpacts, and shaped with due regard for federalism —\\ndo not apply to treaty claims , and that the only \\nrelevant precedent is Fishing  Vessel . U.S. BIO at  \\n25-26. But Fishing  Vessel  announced no different \\nstandard and upheld an injunction carefully designed \\nto implement the treaty right to a fair share  of \\navailable fish. United States v. Washington , 384  \\nF. Supp. 312, 413 (W.D. Wash. 1974) ; see Fishing  \\nVessel , 443 U.S. at 685 -89. By con trast, the injunction \\nhere is not narrowly tailored to prevent \"destruction \" \\nof salmon or even to implement the \"moderate living \" \\nright declared by the Ninth Circuit. Pet. App. 94a. As \\nJudge O \\'Scannlain noted, the injunction forces the \\nState to replace hun dreds of culverts \"without regard \\nto whether replacement of a particular culvert \\nactually will increase the available salmon habitat. \" \\nPet. App. 37a.  \\n Neither Respondent disputes this. The United \\nStates excuses this overbroad injunction by claiming \\nthat the district court followed the State \\'s own \\nprioritization methodology. U.S. BIO at 24. Not so. \\nThe district court criticized and rejected the State \\'s \\nprioritization, Pet. App. 169a -70a, and substituted its \\nown, Pet. App. 237a. It gave equal priority to al l \\nculverts that have \"200 lineal meters or more of \\nsalmon habitat upstream to the first natural passage \\nbarrier, \" Pet. App. 237a, regardless of whether other \\nbarriers prevent salmon from getting to the culvert, \\nand regardless of cost , Pet. App. 247a.  \\n Fina lly, Respondents claim the State has \\ninflated the injunction \\'s costs. U.S. BIO at 25; Tribes \\nBIO at 33. The State has been living under the \\ninjunction for four years, and during that time, \\n12 \\n \\n \\n removing and replacing highway culverts to the \\nstandard the distric t court ordered has averaged \\nseveral million dollars per culvert.4 Even if just a \\nfraction of the hundreds of culverts the injunction \\norders replaced have no impact, tens of millions of \\nstate dollars will be wasted.'}]\n"

      "{'I. The ability of EPA to issue sporadic, unforeseeable, and largely unreviewable exemptions to small refineries imposes significant economic damage on biofuels producers': '.  \\nPetitioners portray the small refinery \\nexemption provisions of the RFS program as a flexible \\ntool created by Congress to guarantee small refineries \\nperpetual financial success. Regardless of the underlying cause of a small refinery\\'s financial trouble – from a global COVID-19 pandemic to its \\ninability to adapt to the slow and foreseeable \\nincreases in biofuel blending requirements of the RFS program – Petitioners believe the solution is for EPA to issue small refineries extensions of their \\nexemptions from RFS obligations \"at any time\" \\nregardless of how long it has been since the small \\nrefinery last held an exemption. Curtailing EPA\\'s \\nsupposed authority to issue dozens of exemptions, Petitioners argue, will produce a wave of small \\nrefinery failures. Pet\\'rs\\' Br. 4, 17. This argument \\nignores the original purpose of the RFS program, its structure, the recent history of small refinery viability, and the countervailing harm that a RFS program administered in that manner causes to \\nbiofuels producers across the country.  \\n14 \\n \\n  Congress did not grant EPA unilateral \\nauthority to put its thumb on the scale in order to influence the price of bi ofuels. The briefs of \\nRespondents and Federal Respondent explain that \\nthe small refinery exemption aspect of the RFS \\nprogram was designed by Co ngress to serve as a \\nbridge that would allow initially disadvantaged small \\nrefineries to eventually attain the ability to ensure \\nperpetual compliance with the RFS biofuel blending \\nmandates. Resp\\'ts\\' Br. 42-46 and Fed. Resp\\'t\\'s Br. 24-29. Respondents and Federal Respondent further explain that the plain and most logical reading of the \\nrelevant statutory text at 42 U.S.C. §7545(o)(9) uses \\nthe term \"extension\" in its temporal sense and \\nincludes a continuity element. Resp\\'ts\\' Br. 19-33 and \\nFed. Resp\\'t\\'s Br. 17-23. \\nPetitioners\\' claim that small refineries are on \\nthe cusp of closure if the av ailability of small refinery \\nexemptions is curtailed is not supported by the evidence.  For compliance years 2013 to 2015, a mere eight, seven, and seven small refinery exemptions \\nwere granted, respectively.\\n20 Nevertheless, \\nPetitioners do not provide evidence that any of the remaining 50+ refineries that did not receive \\nexemptions during that time  were forced to close.   \\nThe reason for the refineries\\' continued success \\nwithout the crutch of a small refinery exemption is \\ntheir ability to purchase RIN s from the open market \\nto compensate for their inability to blend biofuels at a reasonable price. The refineries are able to large pass the costs of those RINs to consumers. While EPA\\'s \\nadministration of the RFS program and its \\n                                                 \\n20 EPA Small Refinery Exemption Dashboard, supra  note 10. \\n15 \\n \\n interpretation of relevant provisions has been \\ninconsistent over the years, EPA has consistently maintained that the cost to purchase RINs on the \\nopen market can largely be passed to consumers.  \\nWhile the CAA is sprinkled with several \\nmandates that provide regulated parties the ability to apply for general hardship exemptions or temporary \\nexemptions based on unforeseen circumstances, EPA \\nexplained in its promulgation of its initial RFS program regulations that the ability of obligated parties to purchase RINs from the nationwide trading program rendered such exemptions unnecessary \\nunder the RFS program. \\nIn recent rulemakings, we have included \\na general hardship exemption for parties that are able to demonstrate severe economic hardship in complying with \\nthe standard. We proposed not to include \\nprovisions for a general hardship exemption in the RFS program. Unlike most other fuels programs, the RFS \\nprogram includes inherent flexibility \\nsince compliance with the renewable \\nfuels standard is based on a nationwide \\ntrading program, without any per gallon requirements, and without any \\nrequirement that the refiner or importer \\nproduce the renewable fuel. By purchasing RINs, obli gated parties will \\nbe able to fulfill their renewable fuel obligation without having to make \\ncapital investments that may otherwise \\nbe necessary in order to blend renewable \\nfuels into gasoline. We believe that \\n16 \\n \\n sufficient RINs will be available and at \\nreasonable prices, given that EIA projects that far gr eater renewable fuels \\nwill be used than required. Given the \\nflexibility provided in the RIN trading \\nprogram, including the provisions for deficit carry-over, and the fact that the \\nstandard is proportional to the volume of \\ngasoline actually produced or imported, we continue to believe a general hardship exemption is not warranted. As a result, the final rule does not contain \\nprovisions for a general hardship \\nexemption.\\n21  \\nA decade later and under a different \\nPresidential Administration, EPA\\'s conclusion on that critical aspect of the RFS program had not changed. \\n\"All obligated parties, including merchant refiners, \\nare generally able to recover the cost of the RINs they need for compliance with the RFS obligations through the cost of the gasoline and diesel fuel they produce.\"\\n22  \\nEven if Petitioners could supply evidence of \\nscattered small refinery closures during the years in \\nwhich few exemptions were granted, that outcome \\ndoes not run contrary to th e larger purpose of the RFS \\nprogram when you consider that during that same \\ntime a plethora of new dome stic biofuels production \\nfacilities were constructed. For example, as of October \\n                                                 \\n21 U.S. EPA, Regulation of Fuels and Fuel Additives: Renewable \\nFuel Standard Program; Final Rule , 72 Fed.

When market demand for \\nrenewable fuels declines , which occurred when EPA \\nremoved 1.8 billion gallons of renewable fuel demand \\nthrough its issuance of an unprecedented number of \\nsmall refinery exemptions, some biofuels can no longer be economically produced. EPA\\'s previous \\nactions destroyed demand and killed the market.     \\nIn the face of declining RIN prices following the \\nunprecedented wave of small refinery exemptions, ABFA members experienced ne gative impact to their \\nrevenues, delayed long-term renewable fuel \\ninvestments, and reduced biofuel blending activities \\nthat left underutilized the blending infrastructure in \\nwhich they had already heavily invested.\\n24 Some \\n                                                 \\n23 U.S. Energy Information Administration, U.S. Biodiesel Plant \\nProduction Capacity (Oct. 23, 2020), \\nhttps://www.eia.gov/biofuels/biodiesel/capacity/ .  \\n24 Brief of Petitioner at 81-84, 89-92 (Decl. of ABFA members M. \\nWhitney and J.

      "{\"II. Affirming the Tenth Circuit's opinion will rightfully undercut EPA's ability to arbitrarily award secret financial windfalls to small refineries that escape judicial review and disrupt biofuels markets\": '. \\nThe briefs of Respondents and Federal \\nRespondent present compelling explanations as to why the only logical and practical reading of RFS \\nsmall refinery extension language is for the word \\n\"extension\" in 42 U.S.C. § 7545(o)(9)(B)(i) to have a temporal meaning and to include an inherent continuity requirement. Resp\\'ts\\' Br. 19-46 and Fed. \\nResp\\'t\\'s Br. 17-30. It is worth noting that in ABFA\\'s \\nlitigation against EPA in the D.C. Circuit, which was \\nthe first time the question at issue regarding \\nextensions of exemptions was raised in federal court, \\nPetitioner HollyFrontier Refining and Marketing \\nLLC (then acting as Intervenor-Respondent in \\nsupport of EPA) agreed that the \"plain meaning of the \\n                                                 \\n25 Id. at 85-88  (Declaration of ABFA member S. Lamb explaining \\nthat business creating renewable fuels from waste grease from wastewater treatment plants was required to cease production \\nand lay off the majority of its wo rkforce following a drop in RINs \\nprices).  \\n19 \\n \\n noun \\'extension\\' (or its verb, \\'extend\\')\" is \"prolong\" or \\n\"to increase the length or duration of . . . .\" Brief of Intervenor-Respondents at 48, \\nAdvanced Biofuels \\nAss\\'n v. EPA , No. 18-1115, 2019 WL 2615358 at 38 \\n(D.C. Cir. June 25, 2019). Petitioner HollyFrontier \\nRefining and Marketing LLC now argues that \"extension\" means \"to grant.\" Pet\\'rs\\' Br. 18-19. \\nThis Court\\'s decision should be driven by the \\nclear intent of Congress, through the express language used in 42 U.S.C. §7545(o)(9), to limit small refineries relief from complying with the RFS obligations to extensions of their earlier temporary \\nexemptions. The Court should take comfort, however, \\nthat such a ruling will have the additional benefit of \\nlargely ending EPA\\'s practice of awarding large \\neconomic windfalls to unidentified small refineries, in unknown amounts, for unknown reasons, through the \\nissuance of confidential de cision documents that are \\nlargely immune from judicial review yet send economic ripple effects through the RINs market to the detriment of biofuels prod ucers and  refineries not \\nreceiving such largess. \\nAs explained above, EPA\\'s small refinery \\nexemption decisions are shrouded by secrecy. While \\nEPA now publishes on an online dashboard basic data about the number of petitions for extensions of small \\nrefinery exemptions that it has received, granted, or \\ndenied as well as the es timated number of gallons of \\nrenewable fuel and RINs exempted from the RFS program, the agency still refuses to publish the identifies of the refineries that have applied for or \\nreceived extensions of exem ptions or the rationales \\nfor those decisions. Incredibly, only EPA, the \\ncompanies and ABFA\\'s counsel knows who received \\n20 \\n \\n exemptions for compliance years 2016 and 2017 and \\nwhy, which is subject to a protective order.    \\nThe dubious legal rationale underpinning this \\nveil of secrecy is that all sma ll refineries that petition \\nfor extensions of exemptions claim that the information in the petitions is confidential business information (\"CBI\"). EPA then unquestioningly treats \\nas CBI all information in its final decision document, \\neven down to the name of the company seeking the exemption. EPA claims that regulations at 40 C.F.R. §§ 2.204, 2.205, and 2.208 require it to treat as CBI any information that small refineries claim is \\nconfidential until EPA can evaluate that claim. In \\nreality, however, EPA makes no effort to review the \\nsmall refineries\\' over-inclusive claims of CBI and \\nnever releases additional information about the recipients of the exemptions.  \\nEPA and the refineries had every reason to \\nproceed in secrecy.  This practice allows EPA to issue small refinery exemptions free from oversight or scrutiny from the public, Congress, or courts. EPA has \\nrefused, based on claims of CBI, to provide detailed \\ninformation about its small refinery exemption \\ndecisions in response to requests from Congress.\\n26 \\nEPA maintains this policy even after a refinery publicly discloses its receipt of a small refinery \\nexemption in public filings to the U.S. Securities and \\nExchange Commission. Even in the face of protracted Freedom of Information Act li tigation, EPA refused to \\nidentify the name or location of small refineries receiving exemptions, thereby shielding those \\ndecisions from judicial review. \\nSee Renewable Fuels \\n                                                 \\n26 See Grassley letter, supra  note 7.  \\n21 \\n \\n Ass\\'n v.
