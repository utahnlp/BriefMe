No principle compels \\nsuch an anomalous result, and this Court should not \\ncreate an Article III except ion that excludes nominal-\\ndamages awards from ordinary justiciability rules. \\nThe officials do not contest that their actions \\ncaused Chike and Joseph real injury. Their argument is that nominal damages do not redress past injuries. \\nBut nominal damages vindic ate constitutional viola-\\ntions, including where the harm is not quantifiable. \\nMemphis Cmty. Sch. Dist. v. Stachura , 477 U.S. 299, \\n308 n.11 (1986) (quoting Carey v. Piphus , 435 U.S. \\n247, 266 (1978)). And contrary to the Eleventh Circuit\\u2019s belief, they do so \\u201cfor the plaintiff\\u2019s benefit.\\u201d \\nFarrar v. Hobby , 506 U.S. 103, 113 (1992). Those \\nprinciples, common-law history, and common sense all show that a nominal-damages award provides a \\npersonal, tangible benefit that redresses a plaintiff\\u2019s \\ninjury. Article III requires nothing more. \\nProviding a remedy to plaintiffs like Chike and \\nJoseph has neither flooded the courts with lawsuits \\nnor bankrupted officials in the many circuits that \\nallow standalone nominal-damages awards. Nominal \\ndamages, like compensato ry damages, have \\u201ccoex-\\nisted with our constitutional system since the dawn of the Republic.\\u201d Tanzin v. Tanvir , __ S. Ct. __, 2020 WL \\n7250100, at *5 (Dec. 10, 2020). And a nation of laws \\nrequires  a way for courts to make things right when \\nofficials violate rights. Because nominal-damages claims satisfy Arti cle III, this Court should reverse. \\n2 \\nREPLY ARGUMENT  \\nI. T h i s  C o u r t  s h o u l d  d e c l i n e  t o  c r e a t e  a n  \\nArticle III exception that excludes nominal-\\ndamages awards from ordinary justicia-\\nbility rules. \\nThe officials do not deny that Chike and Joseph \\nsuffered a concrete injury-in-fact, nor do they deny \\ncausation. Their only objection is redressability. In making that objection, they confuse redressability \\nwith quantifiability . Because nominal damages \\nvindicate past legal violations, Chike and Joseph\\u2019s nominal-damages claims s atisfy Article III and are \\nnot moot. \\nA. Nominal damages redress past constitu-\\ntional injury. \\nArticle III standing requires  a plaintiff to show he \\nhas suffered (1) a concrete and particularized injury-\\nin-fact, (2) caused by the defendant, (3) that is likely \\nto be redressed by a favorable court ruling. Spokeo, \\nInc. v. Robins , 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016). The \\nofficials do not dispute injury or causation. And \\nredressability requires only that a plaintiff personally \\n\\u201cbenefit in a tangible way from\\u201d court intervention. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\\u2019t , 523 U.S. 83, \\n103 n.5 (1998) (quotation omitted). A plaintiff \\nsatisfies that test by showing that a court order would \\n\\u201cpartially redress\\u201d his injury. Meese v. Keene , 481 U.S. \\n465, 476 (1987). Nominal-damages awards, though \\nsmall, satisfy that standard.\\n1 \\n \\n1 The officials articulate a second redressability requirement: \\nthat the relief \\u201ctarget and redress the plaintiff\\u2019s asserted injury\\u201d \\nrather than someone else\\u2019s. Resp.Br.12. But that is no different \\nthan requiring that the remedy \\u201cpersonally\\u201d benefit the plaintiff. \\n3 \\nThe officials confuse redressability with quanti-\\nfiability. Consider a studen t who shared her faith on \\ncampus by chalking messages about Jesus Christ on \\nthe sidewalk, only to see a professor direct his class to erase them.\\n2 Even if the officials modified their \\npolicies to prevent this First Amendment violation \\nfrom happening again, the officials admit that this student could litigate to final judgment her 1\\u00a2 \\ncompensatory-damages claim for the consumed chalk. \\nEven a single penny of relief partially benefits the stu-dent personally and in a tangible way. \\nNow consider Chike. The officials do not dispute \\nhe was injured when they twice stopped him from speaking. The problem is that he cannot monetize the \\nlost speech\\u2019s value. But Chike\\u2019s lost speech is far more \\nvaluable than the consumed chalk. And it is the lost \\nspeech that gives Chike the right to seek judicial \\nredress; the $1 in nominal damages that officials \\nmust pay Chike is no less a partial redress that personally and tangibly benefits him than is the \\npenny that redresses the chalk user. A nominal-\\ndamages award \\u201cmodifies th e defendant\\u2019s behavior \\nfor the plaintiff\\u2019s benefit by forcing the defendant to \\npay an amount of money he otherwise would not pay.\\u201d \\nFarrar , 506 U.S. at 113. And in this way, the payment \\nof nominal damages \\u201cmaterially alters\\u201d the parties\\u2019 \\nlegal relationship, id. at 111\\u201312, in the same way as \\na modest compensatory-damages award. \\n \\n \\n2 Compare with Fresno State Students for Life  v. Thatcher , No. \\n1:17-at-00382 (E.D. Cal.), available at https://perma.cc/566E-\\n6EBZ. . \\n4 \\nThe officials say that whil e one dollar in compen-\\nsatory damages redresses a past injury, one dollar in \\nnominal damages does not. Resp.Br.17\\u201319. Again, \\nthis is confusion over quantifiability. Contra City of \\nRiverside v. Rivera , 477 U.S. 561, 574 (1986) \\n(plaintiff\\u2019s vindication of \\u201cimportant civil and \\nconstitutional rights that cannot be valued solely in monetary terms\\u201d). Courts  award nominal damages \\nprimarily when there has been an \\u201cinfraction of a \\nlegal right\\u201d but the \\u201cextent of loss is not shown.\\u201d C\\nHARLES T. MCCORMICK , HANDBOOK ON THE LAW OF \\nDAMAGES  \\u00a7 20 at 85 (1935). So it\\u2019s not that nominal \\ndamages offer \\u201c zero legally recognized relief for a past \\ninjury,\\u201d Resp.Br.19 (emphasis added), it\\u2019s that they \\noffer partial relief. Skyline Wesleyan Church v. Cal. \\nDep\\u2019t of Managed Health Care , 968 F.3d 738, 749 (9th \\nCir. 2020) (\\u201cNominal damages would redress \\nSkyline\\u2019s injury, even if only to a minimal extent.\\u201d). \\nAnd because nominal dama ges \\u201cmaterially alter[  ]\\u201d \\nthe parties\\u2019 relationship, Farrar , 506 U.S. at 111\\u201312, \\nthat is sufficient for Article III. Meese , 481 U.S. at 476. \\n\\u201cNothing more is needed to establish redressability.\\u201d Skyline , 968 F.3d at 749. Otherwise, justiciability of \\nidentical claims turns on mere semantics. ACLU Br. \\n11\\u201312 (discussing Freenor v. Mayor & Alderman of \\nSavannah , No. CV414-247, 2019 WL 9936663 (S.D. \\nGa. May 20, 2019)). \\nAs this Court intimated in Carey , nominal dam-\\nages make a constitutional deprivation \\u201cactionable.\\u201d \\n435 U.S. at 266. That is because they redress a plain-\\ntiff\\u2019s concrete and particula rized injury in a personal, \\ntangible way. U.S.Br.17\\u201319 (same result if Congress \\nauthorized a minimum $1,000 award for First \\nAmendment violations). A nominal-damages award partially redresses a loss of incalculable value. \\n5 \\nB. This Court\\u2019s decisions confirm that \\nnominal damages\\u2019 primary purpose is \\npast redress of valuable\\u2014even \\npriceless\\u2014rights. \\nNominal damages\\u2014like other remedies\\u2014have \\nmultiple effects that can include the declaration of \\nrights or the protection of prospective rights. But this \\nCourt\\u2019s precedents and numerous lower-court \\ndecisions show that nominal damages\\u2019 primary \\npurpose is to redress past legal violations. \\nCarey  decided that nominal damages, rather than \\npresumed damages, were the appropriate award for \\nconstitutional violations where harm cannot be mon-etized. 435 U.S. at 266. But the context was not \\u201cpro-\\nspective redress.\\u201d Contra Resp.Br.24. It was about \\nremedying a past \\u201cdeprivation\\u201d of rights. 435 U.S. at \\n266. That is why the Court did not speak in terms of \\nany \\u201cprospective\\u201d due-process problem but to the past \\n\\u201cdenial of procedur al due process.\\u201d Ibid. Accord, e.g., \\nStachura , 477 U.S. at 308 & n.11 (same point in free-\\nspeech context); Arizonans for Official English v. \\nArizona , 520 U.S. 43, 69 & n.24 (1997) (contrasting \\nnominal damages and injunctive relief). \\nLikewise, in Farrar , the plaintiff dropped a claim \\nfor injunctive relief and pursued only an unsuccessful compensatory-damages claim.  506 U.S. at 106. In \\ndetermining that a nominal-damages award made the \\nplaintiff a prevailing party under \\u00a7  1983, this Court \\nemphasized that \\u201c Carey  obligates a court to award \\nnominal damages when a plaintiff establishes the \\nviolation of his [constitutional] right.\\u201d Id. at 112. That \\nis, this Court correctly saw the award of nominal \\ndamages as retrospective redress, not prospective \\nprotection. \\n6 \\nUnsurprisingly, lower courts have consistently \\nrelied on this Court\\u2019s cases to hold that a plaintiff \\nwhose constitutional rights have been violated \\n\\u201cshould not lose his right to proceed\\u201d if \\u201conly nominal damages are at stake.\\u201d Amato v. City of Saratoga \\nSprings , 170 F.3d 311, 319 (2d Cir. 1999) (discussing \\nCarey ). Petitioners\\u2019 opening brief discussed many \\nsuch cases. Pet.Br.27\\u201328. Yet the officials fail to \\nrespond to many. There are more examples, in count-\\nless settings. E.g., ACLU Br. 13\\u201319; Found. for \\nIndividual Rights in Educ. [FIRE] Br. 5\\u20139; Becket Fund Br. 20\\u201325; Pacific Legal Found. Br. 1\\u20134, 12\\u201316.  \\nThe officials\\u2019 rule also vi olates this Court\\u2019s prece-\\ndent in analogous contexts. For example, the officials \\ninsist that statutory damages are \\u201cdifferent in kind\\u201d \\nbecause they \\u201cdo not signify nothing .\\u201d Resp.Br.19\\u201320. \\nBut statutory and nominal damages serve the same \\npurpose: providing \\u201crecompense for injury\\u201d where \\n\\u201cthe rules of law render diff icult or impossible proof of \\ndamages.\\u201d Douglas v. Cunningham , 294 U.S. 207, 209 \\n(1935). The officials concede that it \\u201cis good enough \\nfor Article III\\u201d when Congre ss sets statutory damages \\nwhere it \\u201cmight be hard to measure\\u201d actual damages. \\nResp.Br.19\\u201320. It is no different when courts award \\nnominal damages for the same reason. \\nThe same is true of liquidated damages, which \\nassign a fixed value to harm where actual damages \\n\\u201cmay be difficult or impossible to ascertain.\\u201d Rex \\nTrailer Co. v. United States , 350 U.S. 148, 153\\u201354 \\n(1956). And punitive dama ges are non-compensatory \\nand sometimes awarded without compensatory harm. U.S.Br.19\\u201320. Yet the offici als do not dispute that a \\nplaintiff with a standalone claim for statutory, \\nliquidated, or punitive da mages has failed to present \\nan Article III case or controversy. \\n7 \\nThe officials criticize Chike and Joseph for \\nequating \\u201cvindication\\u201d of rights with Article III \\nredress. Resp.Br.21\\u201323. But where \\u201cthere has been a \\nviolation of a right, the person injured is entitled to an action. If he is entitled to an action, he is entitled \\nat least to nominal damages,  or else he would not be \\nentitled to a recovery.\\u201d Parker v. Griswold , 17 Conn. \\n288, 303 (1846). \\nC. At common law, courts routinely award-\\ned standalone nominal damages solely to redress past injuries. \\nNo one disputes that English and American \\ncommon-law courts consistently adjudicated claims for nominal damages in a wide array of cases, and \\nthat such claims arose from a past violation of rights. \\nYet the officials insist that when common-law courts \\ndid award nominal damages, it was only for \\ncontinuing or threatened injuries. Resp.Br.28\\u201340. \\nCenturies of cases debunk this theory. \\nFor one thing, the officials concede that entire cat-\\negories of common-law cases involved the award of \\nnominal damages even \\u201cwhe n they would not plainly \\nserve as prospective relief.\\u201d Id. at 34. These include \\ncases (like this one) when the plaintiff \\u201cproved a legal \\nviolation\\u201d but failed to establish or quantify compensatory damages, ibid. , \\u201cas a vehicle for costs,\\u201d \\nid. at 32\\u201334, or for \\u201cdignitary harms,\\u201d id. at 38. And \\nthese categories of cases\\u2014which alone undermine the officials\\u2019 historical analysis\\u2014are just a few examples. \\nEnglish courts inferred nominal damages when-\\never the plaintiff establish ed an invasion of a legal \\nright, no matter if ther e was a continuing or \\nthreatened injury. \\u201c[I]njury imports a damage, \\nthough it does not cost the party one farthing.\\u201d Ashby  \\n8 \\nv. White , 92 Eng. Rep. 126, 137 (1703) (Holt, J.). \\nCourts \\u201cimport[ed] a dama ge\\u201d for various claims, \\nincluding breach of contract, trespass, and personal \\ninjury. Ibid.  (\\u201ca cuff on the ear\\u201d would be actionable \\n\\u201cfor it is a personal injury\\u201d).  \\nFor personal rights, nominal damages served to \\nremedy past harms, not to  protect against future \\ninjury. In Ashby , for example, the House of Lords held \\nthat an elector who was wrongfully turned away from \\nthe polls by an official could sue without proving the \\u201cpossibility of a future profi t\\u201d or the \\u201cpossibility of a \\nfuture\\u201d damage. 87 Eng. Rep. 810, 810, 813 (1703) \\n(Powell, J., & Gould, J.). Often these violations occurred when an official fa iled to perform his duty \\nbut cured the defect before suit. In these cases, plain-\\ntiffs could still recover nominal damages for the past \\ninjury even though they had no need for prospective \\nrelief. E.g., Barker v. Green , 130 Eng. Rep. 327, 327 \\n(1824) (sheriff\\u2019s one-day delay in arrest on writ); Bales \\nv. Wingfield , 4 Q.B. 580, n. (multi-week delay by \\nsheriff in executing a lien writ); Clifton  v. Hooper , 115 \\nEng. Rep. 175, 175, 178 (1844) (sheriff delay in exe-cuting process). This was al so true for actions brought \\nagainst private citizens. E.g., Marzetti v. Williams , \\n109 Eng. Rep. 842, 845\\u201347 (1830) (one-day delay in issuing check); Godefroy  v. Jay, 131 Eng. Rep. 159, \\n159\\u201362 (1831) (client could receive nominal damages \\nfor attorney\\u2019s negligence). \\nAmerican courts followed suit. Plaintiffs could \\nrecover at least nominal damages for injuries caused \\nby public officials without showing the threat of future harm. E.g.,  Mickles v. Hart , 1 Denio 548, 550 \\n(N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1845) (sheriff deputy\\u2019s delay in \\nexecuting debt); Laflin v. Willard , 33 Mass. 64, 67 \\n(1835) (same); Waterhouse v. Waite , 11 Mass. 207, 210 \\n9 \\n(1814) (same); Burns v. Erben , 26 How. Pr. 273, 277 \\n(N.Y. Super. Ct. 1864) (false imprisonment); Doherty  \\nv. Munson , 127 Mass. 495, 496 (1879) (detention \\nunder illegal warrant). And American courts routinely awarded nominal damages in private \\nactions when such an award could provide no \\nprospective relief. E.g., Thompson  v. New Orleans, J. \\n& G.N.R. Co. , 50 Miss. 315, 320 (1874) (train \\nconductor passed passenger\\u2019s stop by two miles); \\nCrosby v. Humphreys , 60 N.W. 843, 844 (Minn. 1894) \\n(assault); Young v. W. Union Tel. Co. , 11 S.E. 1044, \\n1044\\u201345 (N.C. 1890) (negligent delay in delivering \\ntelegraph); McKim  v. Bartlett , 129 Mass. 226, 229 \\n(1880) (estate administrator liable for at least nomi-nal damages after court discharged future liability).  \\nThis partial list shows that early American \\ncourts\\u2014like their English counterparts\\u2014undeniably \\nawarded nominal damages so lely for past injuries. \\nAccord, e.g., U.S.Br.10\\u201311; Nat\\u2019l Right to Work Legal \\nDef. Found. Br. 4\\u201310. \\nEven a nominal-damages award in a trespass, \\nriparian-rights, or other pr operty case was intended, \\nfirst and foremost, to vindicate the past \\u201cviolation of \\nthe plaintiff\\u2019s right.\\u201d Delaware & Hudson Canal Co.  \\nv. Torrey , 33 Pa. 143, 148 (1859); accord Embrey v. \\nOwen , 155 Eng. Rep. 579, 585 (1851) (same). And that \\nis why common-law courts awarded nominal damages \\nin property cases even when the parties\\u2019 future rights \\nand obligations were not at stake. E.g., Hefley  v. \\nBaker , 19 Kan. 9, 11 (1877) (pure trespass case with \\nno property-line dispute); Curtis v. Paggett , 27 P. 109, \\n109\\u201310 (Kan. 1891) (same); Cook v. Loomis , 26 Conn. \\n483, 486 (1857) (trover case where property already \\nreturned); Mears v. Cornwall , 40 N.W. 931, 932\\u201334 \\n(Mich. 1888) (same); Warder v. Baldwin , 8 N.W. 257, \\n10 \\n258 (Wis. 1881) (same); Moon v. Raphael , 132 Eng. \\nRep. 122, 122 (1835) (same). And plaintiffs at common \\nlaw could waive their right to compensatory damages \\nand choose to seek nominal damages alone. Pet.Br.42; \\naccord Daniels v. Bates , 2 Greene 151, 152 (Iowa \\n1849); Pastorius v. Fisher , 1 Rawle 27, 29 (Pa. 1828). \\nThe officials\\u2019 failure to address so many of these \\ncases is no mere oversight. Many are on all fours with \\nthe constitutional violations at issue here and \\nestablish the common-law ru le that nominal damages \\nsupport a claim for past constitutional violations. So \\ndo cases involving intentional torts. Frederick \\nDouglass Found. Br. 6\\u20138 (c omparing Petitioners\\u2019 \\ninjuries to those caused by intentional torts, for which \\ncourts awarded nominal damages); Stachura , 477 \\nU.S. at 306 (level of \\u00a7  1983 damages \\u201cdetermined \\naccording to principles de rived from the common law \\nof torts\\u201d). \\nThe officials say that, even if common-law courts \\nawarded nominal damages with no \\u201cprospective \\nremedial benefits,\\u201d such awards were meaningless \\nand insufficient \\u201cfor maintaining an action.\\u201d Resp.Br.35\\u201336. But as detailed above, countless cases \\nheld that a standalone nominal-damages claim \\nsustained a case having no effect on future rights. It would be passing strange for so many courts, over so \\nmany years, to adjudicate  nominal-damages claims \\nthat they thought served no purpose and, in the officials\\u2019 view, violated redressability requirements. \\nFinally, while early common-law courts may have \\nbeen unwilling to reverse a trial court\\u2019s failure to award nominal damages in trifling or frivolous cases, \\nResp.Br.34\\u201335; Fleming  v. Gilbert , 3 Johns 528, 532 \\n(N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1808); Robertson v. Gentry , 5 Ky. 542, \\n11 \\n543 (Ct. App. 1812), that reluctance faded when \\n\\u201cimportant\\u201d rights were at stake. Blackburn v. Ala. \\nGreat S. R. Co. , 39 So. 345, 346 (Ala. 1905); Hecht  v. \\nHarrison , 40 P. 306, 309\\u201310 (Wyo. 1895). Modern \\ncourts view nominal damages the same way when a \\nplaintiff alleges a constitutional violation. E.g., Risdal \\nv. Halford , 209 F.3d 1071, 1073 (8th Cir. 2000) \\n(reversing for plain error because the district court \\nfailed to instruct the jury  to award nominal damages \\nif it found a free-speech violation); Zok v. State , 903 \\nP.2d 574, 579 (Alaska 1995) (failure to award nominal \\ndamages for unlawful arrest was plain error because \\nthe \\u201cright to be free from unlawful confinement is sufficiently important and fundamental in our \\nsociety\\u201d). Indeed, circuit co urts uniformly hold that an \\naward of nominal damages is mandatory upon \\nproving a constitutional violation. Pet.Br.30\\u201331 n.4 \\n(collecting cases). The officials\\u2019 cramped theory of \\nnominal damages cannot explain away this history. \\nD. Nominal damages are not a mere \\nanalogue for declaratory relief. \\nNominal damages\\u2019 primary purpose is to redress \\na past injury. Yet the officials continue to assert that \\n\\u201c[d]eclaratory judgments are the analogue,\\u201d \\nResp.Br.41, unless sovereign or qualified immunity is at stake, in which case th e officials feel differently, id. \\nat 42 n.3. The officials are incorrect. U.S.Br.23\\u201327. \\nTo be sure, \\u201call judgments of courts declare jural \\nrelations.\\u201d Edwin M. Borchard, The Declaratory \\nJudgment\\u2014A Needed Procedural Reform , 28 Y\\nALE \\nL.J. 1, 4 (1918). Yet courts do not equate all forms of \\nrelief with declaratory judgments just because they share this one trait. \\n12 \\nNor do the officials rebut the many other differ-\\nences between declaratory judgments and nominal \\ndamages that unravel their flawed analogy. First, \\nnominal damages are legal relief, while declaratory judgments are equitable. Resp.Br.42 n.3. Second, \\ndeclaratory judgments were designed to determine \\nlegal rights \\u201c before breach .\\u201d Edwin M. Borchard, The \\nUniform Act on Declaratory Judgments , 34 H\\nARV. L. \\nREV. 697, 707 (1921). Nominal damages remedy past \\nharm, unavailable until an injury has occurred. C\\nHARLES T. MCCORMICK , HANDBOOK ON THE LAW OF \\nDAMAGES  \\u00a7 20 at 85 (1935) (\\u201cNominal damages are \\nawarded for the infraction of a legal right.\\u201d). \\nThird, declaratory judgments are primarily \\nprospective relief, Christian Legal Soc\\u2019y v. Martinez , \\n561 U.S. 661, 676 n.6 (2010), while nominal damages, \\nwhich require a past violation, are primarily retro-\\nspective, Arizonans for Official English , 520 U.S. at \\n69 & n.24.   Fourth, the Declaratory Judgment Act \\n\\u201cconfers a discretion  on the courts,\\u201d not an \\u201cabsolute \\nright upon the litigant.\\u201d Wilton v. Seven Falls Co. , 515 \\nU.S. 277, 287 (1995). Nominal damages are manda-tory. Farrar , 506 U.S. at 112 (\\u201c Carey obligate[d] a \\ncourt to award nominal damages when a plaintiff \\nestablishes the violation of his right\\u201d). And finally, \\nunlike declaratory judgments,  courts have held that \\nnominal damages are subject to sovereign- and \\nqualified-immunity defenses. E.g., Am. Civil Liberties \\nUnion v. U.S. Conf. of Cath. Bishops , 705 F.3d 44, 53 \\nn.7 (1st Cir. 2013) (sovereign immunity); Hopkins v. \\nSaunders , 199 F.3d 968, 978 (8th Cir. 1999) (qualified \\nimmunity). \\nIn sum, the disparities between declaratory judg-\\nments and nominal damages are stark. And rightly \\nso, as their primary purpose is decidedly different. \\n13 \\nE. The officials\\u2019 view of nominal damages \\ncontradicts Article III requirements. \\nRationalizing some of the many instances in \\nwhich common-law courts awarded nominal damages \\nfor the past violation of rights, the officials argue that \\nthe \\u201cjurisdictional hook\\u201d is \\u201cthe plaintiff\\u2019s live claim \\nfor compensatory damages.\\u201d Resp.Br.26. This hook saves a nominal-damages claim from mootness, say \\nthe officials, even if the plaintiff\\u2019s compensatory-\\ndamages claim fail s on the merits. Ibid.  That \\nreasoning cannot be right. \\nTo begin, \\u201ca plaintiff must demonstrate standing \\nfor each claim he seeks to press and for each form of relief that is sought.\\u201d Town of Chester v. Laroe Ests., \\nInc., 137 S. Ct. 1645, 1650 (2017) (citation omitted). It \\nis impossible for a compensatory-damage remedy to \\nbe a \\u201cjurisdictional hook\\u201d for a separate, moot remedy. \\nA nominal-damages remedy mu st (and does) stand on \\nits own merits from the case\\u2019s inception. \\nIn addition, \\u201can actual controversy must be extant \\nat all stages of review, not merely at the time the com-\\nplaint is filed.\\u201d Arizonans for Official English , 520 \\nU.S. at 67 (citation omitted). Once a plausible claim \\nfor compensatory damages fail s at the merits stage, it \\nis again impossible for that claim to be a \\u201cjurisdictional hook\\u201d for a separate, moot claim. \\nMoreover, a plaintiff must quantify injury to \\nclaim compensatory damage s. Yet the loss of First \\nAmendment freedoms like speech and religious \\nexercise constitutes \\u201cirreparable injury.\\u201d Roman \\nCatholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , __ S. Ct. __, \\n2020 WL 6948354, at *3 (Nov. 25, 2020). Such injury \\n\\u201ccannot be adequately measured or compensated by \\nmoney.\\u201d Irreparable Injury , B\\nLACK \\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY  \\n14 \\n(11th ed. 2019). The officials\\u2019 position would lead to \\nthe indefensible result that the appropriate remedy \\nfor a past violation of rights is one that in some cases \\nwill not be available. \\nFinally, the officials\\u2019 position deprives some \\nvictims of government misconduct of any remedy. The \\nofficials say that without plausible compensatory-damages remedies, plaintiffs can still \\u201cvindicate their \\nrights through claims for prospective relief like \\ninjunctions and declaratory judgments.\\u201d Resp.Br.46\\u201348. But that only underscor es the correctness of Chike \\nand Joseph\\u2019s position: that eliminating the nominal-\\ndamages remedy would allo w officials to make a \\nstrategic post-filing change in policy solely to moot \\nprospective relief. Such a risk is real because \\ngovernment officials have strong incentives to moot \\ncases. Becket Fund Br. 8\\u201314; Joseph C. Davis & \\nNicholas R.

The officials propose a phantom remedy to \\ninsulate their unconstitutional acts from legal accountability. \\n  \\n15 \\nII. The officials\\u2019 reasons for creating a nominal-\\ndamages exception to Article III are indefensible. \\nThe officials predict dire  effects if this Court \\nallows partial redress for the violation of Chike and \\nJoseph\\u2019s rights. Yet it ha s been \\u201cwidely recognized\\u201d \\nfor ages \\u201cthat a claim for nominal damages precludes mootness\\u201d based on later events. N.Y. State Rifle & \\nPistol Ass\\u2019n v. City of N.Y. , 140 S. Ct. 1525, 1536 \\n(2020) (Alito, J., dissenting); Pet.Br.14 n.2 (catalog-uing eight circuits\\u2019 rule). None of these asserted \\nconsequences have material ized in the jurisdictions \\nthat have rejected the Eleventh Circuit\\u2019s novel and indefensible approach. The officials\\u2019 arguments lack \\nmerit. \\nA. The majority rule does not require \\nadvisory opinions. \\nThe officials say that nominal-damages claims \\ninvite advisory opinions. Resp.Br. 2, 9\\u201310, 22, 41\\u201342. Not so. To quote the officials\\u2019 own cases, advisory opinions \\u201cadvis[e] what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\\u201d Aetna Life Ins. Co. of \\nHartford v. Haworth , 300 U.S. 227, 241 (1937). \\nAccord, e.g., Preiser v. Newkirk , 422 U.S. 395, 401 \\n(1975) (same);  Ashcroft v. Mattis , 431 U.S. 171, 172 \\n(1977) (per curiam).

Zwickler , 394 U.S. 103, 108 (1969): whether \\nofficials violated their free -speech rights. It is not \\nclear why the officials believe that question is more hypothetical here than if Chike\\u2019s speech had con-sumed 1\\u00a2 of chalk, particularly when the officials do \\n16 \\nnot contest he suffered a cognizable injury-in-fact. \\nThere is nothing advisory about deciding the question \\nand awarding nominal damages. Young Ams. for \\nLiberty Br. 12; Christia n Legal Soc\\u2019y Br. 5\\u20136. \\nB. The majority rule does not eliminate the \\nmootness doctrine. \\nThe longstanding majority rule has not \\u201cswal-\\nlowed\\u201d the mootness doctrine in the eight circuits that \\nfollow it. Contra Resp.Br.43\\u201345. Many constitutional \\ncases seek only prospectiv e relief, either because \\ndamages are barred by sovereign immunity or because the injury is threatened or imminent but has not yet occurred at the time of filing. The mootness doctrine is alive and well for those cases. The \\nsituation here\\u2014where the officials already violated \\nChike\\u2019s and Joseph\\u2019s constitutional rights\\u2014presents \\nthe flip side of mootness: fed eral courts are obligated \\nto adjudicate live controversies. Knox v. Serv. Emps. \\nInt\\u2019l Union, Local 1000 , 567 U.S. 298, 307\\u201308 (2012). \\nPlus, the officials\\u2019 concer n for the vitality of the \\nmootness doctrine is selective. They concede that the \\ndoctrine has not crumbled ev en though a plaintiff can \\navoid mootness by seeking compensation for negli-gible financial damages. Resp.Br.49. So, it will not disintegrate if a plaintiff seeks justice without putting \\nhimself and the courts through the trouble and \\ndisproportionate expense of monetizing, proving, and \\nassessing those injuries, as long experience in the courts of appeals attests. Ar ticle III does not require \\nplaintiffs to repackage no minal-damages claims as \\nsmall damages claims. Both types of claims ensure a \\nlive controversy. \\n17 \\nFar more troublesome problems arise under the \\nofficials\\u2019 rule, which allows governments to moot \\ncases unilaterally and strategically. That approach \\nallows officials to reinstate unconstitutional policies, a phenomenon that the amici have well documented. \\nFIRE Br. 24\\u201327; Becket Fund Br. 10\\u201314; Just. & Free-\\ndom Fund Br. 9, 15\\u201316 & n.4. It creates incentives for officials to run out the clock on many claims, e.g., \\ndelaying until students gr aduate, or prisoners get \\ntransferred.

The majority rule neither wastes judicial \\nresources nor prolongs cases.  \\nThe officials and their amici say that the enduring \\nmajority rule wastes judicial resources, prolongs \\nlawsuits, and increases attorney fees. Resp.Br.45; \\nD.C.Br. 13\\u201321. But government officials who quickly and \\u201creasonably respond\\u201d when initially alerted to an unconstitutional policy, D.C.Br. 4\\u201311, rarely face protracted litigation. \\nConsider what happened here. Three years before \\nChike tried to speak on campus\\u2014in 2013 \\u2014counsel \\ninformed Georgia Gwinnett officials that their poli-cies were unconstitutional. Pet.App.89a\\u201390a. The of-ficials did nothing. Chike questioned the overbreadth and inconsistency of the officia ls\\u2019 policies when he was \\nordered to stop speaking in 2016. Id. at 100a\\u201302a. \\nAgain, officials did nothing. When Chike filed suit in \\n18 \\nDecember 2016, the officials did not recant; they dou-\\nbled down, insisting that sharing the Christian faith \\n\\u201carguably rose to the level of \\u2018fighting words\\u2019\\u201d that the \\nFirst Amendment does not protect. Id. at 155a. \\nIt was not until much later in the case that the \\nofficials changed their unconstitutional policies and then promptly moved to dismiss. Id. at 160a. Imagine \\nhow much litigation and how many constitutional \\ndeprivations the officials could have avoided simply \\nby \\u201creasonably responding\\u201d in 2013. \\nThe reality is officials oft en stubbornly refuse to \\nconcede that they have vi olated someone\\u2019s constitu-\\ntional rights. E.g., N.Y. State Rifle & Pistol Ass\\u2019n , 140 \\nS. Ct. at 1538\\u201339 (Alito, J., dissenting) (city fought the \\nplaintiffs\\u2019 Second Amendment rights \\u201ctooth and nail\\u201d \\nin lower courts, then strategically changed policy to \\n\\u201cmoot\\u201d the case on the eve of oral argument in this Court). The amici briefs are replete with such examples. E.g., Becket Fund Br. 3 (prison changed \\npolicy \\u201c[t]wo weeks before oral argument\\u201d); \\nCatholicVote.org Br. 12 n.4 (city repealed ordinance \\n\\u201cyears into litigation\\u201d an d \\u201cdays\\u201d after grant of en \\nbanc review); Pacific Legal Found. Br. 1\\u20132 (city repealed ban \\u201c[o]n the eve of oral argument\\u201d); FIRE Br. 7 (universities \\u201cdisavow[  ]\\u201d policies \\u201cafter the \\nstart of litigation\\u201d). And though the District of \\nColumbia amici say the Eleventh Circuit\\u2019s rule \\n\\u201cincentivizes government actors to revisit challenged laws,\\u201d the brief\\u2019s listed examples all come from outside the Eleventh Circuit. D.C.Br. 4\\u201311. Indeed, the officials here changed their policies several months before  the Eleventh Circuit adopted its outlier \\nrule, further proving that the majority rule already \\nencourages officials to do the right thing. \\n19 \\nConversely, the longstanding rule does not \\nencourage plaintiffs to pursue pointless litigation \\nsimply to inflict an attorn ey-fee award. This \\u201cCourt\\u2019s \\ndecision not to grant fees in Farrar was born of its \\nreluctance to reward attorneys for bringing less than \\nmeritorious claims that see k, but fail to obtain, large \\nmonetary judgments or fail to promote a larger public good.\\u201d Project Vote/Voting for Am., Inc.  v. Dickerson , \\n444 F. App\\u2019x 660, 664 (4th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) \\n(citing Farrar , 506 U.S. at 116). The same will be true \\nin cases brought simply to harass. But a meritorious \\ncivil-rights claim brought to stop unconstitutional government conduct \\u201cis the very form of litigation Congress wished to encourage by enacting \\u00a7  1988.\\u201d \\nIbid.

App\\u2019x at 664\\u201365 (quoting \\nKoopman v. Water Dist. No. 1 of Johnson Cnty. , 41 \\nF.3d 1417, 1421 (10th Cir. 1994)). Accord Rutherford Inst. Br. 7\\u201312 (discussing implications of tactical \\nmooting).  \\nIt\\u2019s not even clear that following the majority rule \\nwould appreciably increase caseloads. The officials \\nhave provided no evidence that the circuits applying \\nthe majority rule have been overwhelmed with nominal-damages cases. Contra Inst. for Free Speech \\nBr. 16\\u201317 n.11 (statistics showing the opposite). In \\nthe long run, reaching the merits conserves judicial \\n20 \\nresources by produc ing precedent that obviates future \\ndisputes\\u2014sometimes on precisely the same issue,  \\nwhere unconstitutional policies are reinstated after a \\ncase has been strategically mooted. Id. at 17; The \\nPoint Isn\\u2019t Moot , 129 Y ALE L.J.  FORUM  at 338\\u201341. \\nFinally, the most effective way to minimize \\nconstitutional violations is to hold recalcitrant officials accountable, not to deny victims the remedy \\nArticle III allows. Just. & Freedom Fund Br. 17\\u201318; \\ncontra Br. of Nat\\u2019l Conf. of State Legislatures 23\\u201324. When, as here, a prospective plaintiff sends government officials a warning letter, alerting them to unconstitutional conduct, the potential negative consequences of a future judgment, see Br. of Nat\\u2019l \\nConf. of State Legislatures 23\\u201324, are precisely what \\nmotivate the officials to change course. Officials who \\nknow they can violate constitutional rights without cost have no incentive to stop violating the Constitution. \\nIn sum, allowing the gove rnment to unilaterally \\nmoot claims for past consti tutional violations would \\nundermine the vindication of constitutional rights \\nand the Constitution itself. After all, courts are the \\u201cdepartment of the government to whom the protection of the rights of the individual is by the \\nconstitution especially confided.\\u201d 1\\n ST. GEORGE \\nTUCKER , BLACKSTONE \\u2019S COMMENTARIES , App. 357 \\n(1803). Prohibiting the government from doing so would not change the prevailing legal landscape. \\n  \\n21 \\nIII. The officials\\u2019 rule would leave plaintiffs \\nwithout a remedy and result in more violations of constitutional rights.  \\nAbandoning the majority rule would leave some \\nvictims of constitutional violations without a remedy. \\nEquitable relief is often unavailable or easily mooted \\n(as shown here), and constitutional violations often do not cause quantifiable harm. Pet.Br.37; FIRE Br. 5\\u20139. The officials fail to meaningfully engage these points. \\nThe officials first insist that these claims \\u201ccan \\noften be adjudicated\\u201d via \\u201cprospective relief.\\u201d \\nResp.Br.46. But \\u201ccan often\\u201d means \\u201cnot always,\\u201d since such relief is available only when the illegal conduct \\u201cmight happen again.\\u201d Ibid. Those mistreated under \\na later-repealed policy or  subjected to \\u201cone-off\\u201d \\nviolations have no such reme dy. This gives officials at \\nleast one \\u201cfree pass\\u201d to violate the Constitution.   \\nSuch a rule also artificia lly constricts the judici-\\nary\\u2019s ability and duty to protect individual rights \\nbased on an unsupported as surance that officials will \\nuse this leeway altruistic ally and correct mistakes \\nquickly. Perhaps the offic ials\\u2019 suggested approach \\nwould work if we were governed by angels rather than \\nmere \\u201cmen.\\u201d T\\nHE FEDERALIST NO. 51, at 322 (James \\nMadison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961). But amici \\nrecount myriad experiences demonstrating that the judiciary serves as an important check-and-balance. \\nWorse, civil-rights litigants already face daunting \\nterrain:  persuading attorn eys to pro bono represent \\nthem, exhausting administrative remedies, and surviving immunity, which shields all but those who \\ndefy clearly established law. And at least six circuits \\n22 \\nhave even lowered the burden on officials to show a \\ncase is moot. The Point Isn\\u2019t Moot , 129 Y ALE L.J.  \\nFORUM  at 333, n.50. The Eleventh Circuit, like others, \\ngives government officials \\u201cconsiderably more leeway \\nthan private parties in the presumption that they are \\nunlikely to resume illegal activities.\\u201d Coral Springs \\nSt. Sys., Inc.  v. City of Sunrise , 371 F.3d 1320, 1328\\u2013\\n29 (11th Cir. 2004). \\nThis flipped burden forces plaintiffs to prove\\u2014\\nusually with no discovery\\u2014that officials will revert to \\nthe original policy. Yet officials are \\u201cmore likely to strategically moot cases, not less\\u201d than private defendants. The Point Isn\\u2019t Moot , 129 Y\\nALE L.J.  \\nFORUM  at 335. Accord Becket Fund Br. 8\\u201314; FIRE \\nBr. 24\\u201328; CAIR Br. 15\\u201317. \\nFor \\u201cone-off\\u201d violations, the officials insist the \\nremedy is compensation. Resp.Br.49\\u201352. But again, this helps only those who ha ve suffered quantifiable \\nharm. And examples abound of constitutional injuries \\nthat often are not compens able, including unlawful \\nentry of private residences, denial of kosher meals in \\nprison, zoning restrictions on religious institutions, door-to-door proselytizin g restrictions, and free \\nspeech claims on campus\\u2014all examples that would transform difficulty pr oving damages into a \\njurisdictional bar. Hudson  v. Michigan , 547 U.S. 586, \\n610 (2006) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (\\u201cthe majority, like \\nMichigan and the United States, has failed to cite a single reported case in which a plaintiff has collected more than nominal damages solely as a result of a knock-and-announce violation\\u201d); Just. & Freedom Fund Br. 5 n.2; CatholicVote .org Br. 16; ACLU Br. \\n17\\u201318; Islam & Religious Freedom Br. 8\\u20139; Becket \\nFund Br. 20\\u201325; Seventh- Day Adventists Br. 20. \\n23 \\nPlus, some religiously motivated plaintiffs only \\nwant justice or are reluctant to seek money damages \\nfor theological reasons. It\\u2019s a perverse incentive to \\nforce  such plaintiffs to demand compensatory \\ndamages they do not want or need. \\nNor are compensatory damages for intangible \\ninjuries a cure-all. Many circuits require plaintiffs to prove those injuries without relying on their \\nsubjective testimony, and statutes and immunities \\nimpose more hurdles. Becket Fund Br. 15\\u201318. In these and other civil rights ca ses, plaintiffs steer clear \\nof compensatory damages because \\u201ccausation and quantification of damages are burdensome to litigate,\\u201d \\u201cthere is little prospect of substantial \\nrecovery,\\u201d and these clai ms \\u201cprofoundly irritate[  ] the \\njudge.\\u201d Douglas Laycock, The Triumph of Equity , 56 \\nL.\\n & CONTEMP . PROBS . 53, 63 (1993). Discarding the \\nmajority rule on nominal damages leaves no remedy for those plaintiffs who do not have monetizable harm, rendering their rights unenforceable and \\neffectively nonexistent. \\nIf the Court creates an artificial jurisdictional bar \\nthat renders rights unenforceable in certain circum-stances, it is not difficult to predict that more viola-\\ntions of constitutional rights will follow. As this Court \\nhas already recognized, nominal-damages awards \\nensure that constitutional  rights are \\u201cscrupulously \\nobserved.\\u201d Carey , 435 U.S. at 266. Excluding such \\nawards from Article III would guarantee the opposite outcome. Although this problem extends to many backdrops, the context presented here\\u2014free speech on public college and university campuses\\u2014provides \\na stark illustration. \\n24 \\nNearly 90% of public, postsecondary institutions \\nmaintain policies that severely restrict protected \\nspeech or could be applied to do so. FIRE Br. 14\\u201323. \\nMany of these policies ar e vague and overbroad, \\nincluding granting officials unfettered discretion to \\nsilence and punish, or prohibiting offensive expres-\\nsion based on third-party perceptions ( i.e., heckler \\nvetoes). \\nGiven that evidence, there is a real risk that a \\nnew rule disallowing standalone nominal-damages claims would lead university officials to strategically moot controversies after  a student\\u2019s rights are \\nviolated. Doubling down on constitutional depriva-tions would inevitably extend off campus to other \\ngovernment officials, endangering not just free speech \\nand religious exercise, but also Second Amendment \\nrights, the right to be free from illegal searches, unlawful detentions, and many others. \\nA constitutional right that cannot be enforced is \\nno right at all. This Court should say so and reverse.  \\n \\n25 \\nCONCLUSION \\nFor the foregoing reasons, and those stated in \\nPetitioners\\u2019 opening brief, the judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed. \\nRespectfully submitted, \\nK\\nRISTEN K.

The late Howard Jarvis, founder of \\nHJTA, utilized the People of  California\\u2019s reserved \\npower of initiative to sponsor California\\u2019s well-known Proposition 13 in 1978. Proposition 13 was overwhelm-\\ningly approved by California voters and added Article \\nXIII A to the California Constitution. Proposition 13 has kept thousands of fixed income Californians secure \\nin their ability to stay in their own homes by limiting \\nthe ad valorem property tax rate and annual escala-tion of property taxes.\\n1 \\n HJTA has a central and ongoing interest in pro-\\ntecting homeowners\\u2019 rights to retain their homes. In \\nthe unfortunate circumstance of financial distress \\nleading to unpaid property taxes and government fore-closure, HJTA continues to  advocate for homeowners \\nbeing able to receive the remaining equity that right-\\nfully belongs to them and, in  all likelihood, will be their \\nsole economic resource for their next stage of life. \\nHJTA has recently supported legislation to that effect \\nin California and written on this vital current topic known as home equity thef t. (Jon Coupal & Joshua \\n \\n 1 Per Rule 37, the parties were notified and consented to the \\nfiling of this brief more than ten days before its filing. See Sup. \\nCt. R. 37.2(a). Blanket consent from Petitioner was also filed Sep-tember 9, 2022. No party\\u2019s counsel authored any of this brief; ami-\\ncus alone funded its preparation and submission. See Sup. Ct. R. \\n37.6. \\n \\n2 \\n Polk, Stop home equity theft by the state of California , \\nThe Orange County Register (Mar. 27, 2022).2) \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\n The Minnesota statutes at issue violate the Fifth \\nAmendment Takings Clause and the Eighth Amend-\\nment Excessive Fines Clause. They do so by expressly taking home equity for public use without just compen-\\nsation. They also take the owner\\u2019s equity as excessive \\npunishment for non-payment of taxes, even though in-terest and penalties have already been charged. There \\nis no reason for Ms. Tyler to pay her government a pre-\\nmium of $25,000 on top of the $15,000 she owed, which \\nalready included interest and penalties. \\n \\u201cPublic use\\u201d is clear. The Minnesota statute that \\ndistributed Ms. Tyler\\u2019s $25,000 in home equity is titled \\n\\u201cAPPORTIONMENT OF PROCEEDS TO TAXING \\nDISTRICTS.\\u201d (Minn. Stat., \\u00a7 282.08.) The more subtle variety of home equity thef t in California also admits \\n\\u201cpublic use\\u201d in statute. (Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7 3695.4.) \\n Amicus writes separately to highlight the subtle \\nforms of home equity theft that will likely expand with-\\nout a grant of certiorari in this case. California, men-tioned just briefly in the Petition for Certiorari, is \\nplagued by home equity theft as well, and in dangerous \\n \\n 2 https://www.ocregister.com/2022/03/27/stop-home-equity- \\ntheft-by-the-state -of-california/. \\n3 \\n ways that will fly under the radar without enforcement \\nof the Constitution for Ms. Tyler. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nARGUMENT \\nI. Certiorari should be granted because gov-\\nernment, under the Fifth and Eighth \\nAmendments, must respect, not exploit, vulnerable homeowners. \\nA. No one, includin g government, may ex-\\nploit a tax windfall. \\n Governments do not allow taxpayers to take tax \\nwindfalls. (See Handlery Hotels, Inc. v. Franchise Tax \\nBd. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1360; Franck v. Polaris E-Z \\nGo Div. of Textron  (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 1107.) Gov-\\nernments must likewise not be allowed to take tax \\nwindfalls. As Justice Holmes famously wrote, \\u201c[m]en \\nmust turn square corners wh en they deal with the \\nGovernment.\\u201d ( Rock Island, A. & L. R. Co. v. United \\nStates  (1920) 254 U.S. 141, 143.) Likewise, particularly \\nwhen so much is at stake, \\u201c[ i]t is no less good morals \\nand good law that the Gove rnment should turn square \\ncorners in dealing with the people than that the people \\nshould turn square corners in dealing with their Gov-ernment.\\u201d ( St. Regis Paper Co. v. United States  (1961) \\n368 U.S. 208, 229.) Accordingly, governments should \\nnot be trespassers, but trustees, particularly to trag-edy-befallen persons, such as Ms. Tyler, who happen to \\nown a home or other real pro perty that can be levied to \\nsatisfy a tax debt. \\n4 \\n  In this case, as in certain related instances in Cal-\\nifornia, a vulnerable member of society was exploited \\nby her government following a tax sale of her property \\nto cover a delinquency. The Eighth Circuit seems to sanction this as punishment for a distressed home-\\nowner\\u2019s normal human weaknesses when it writes: \\n\\u201cOnly after [Ms. Tyler] declined to avail herself of these opportunities did \\u2018abs olute title\\u2019 pass to the \\nState.\\u201d ( Tyler v. Hennepin Cty.  (8th Cir. 2022) 26 F.4th \\n789, 793.) Thus, while the pri mary issue seems to be \\nwhether the retention of Ms. Tyler\\u2019s $25,000 home eq-\\nuity is a taking under the Fifth Amendment because it \\nwas her property, the Eighth Amendment\\u2019s Excessive Fines Clause is at issue as well. (U.S. Const. amend. V; \\namend. XIV, amend. VIII.) The taking of home equity \\nis clearly intended as a p unishment for nonpayment of \\ntaxes and inability to redeem the debt. As aging and \\nmental health issues are only increasing in America, it \\nis a vital question for all whether seizing the value of the whole property for the repayment of a lesser debt \\nis an excessive and abusive use of government power. \\n Homeownership is a precious goal that many \\nAmericans work hard to achieve. Faulting homeowners \\nfor not heeding warnings to redeem their debts through payment plans or re-purchase disrespectfully \\nignores many distressed homeowners\\u2019 reality. Such \\nhomeowners often come to this position due to age, medical condition, loss of eyesight or other physical \\ndisability, mental impairment, the negligence of a care-\\ngiver, dishonesty of a relative, or simple lack of func-tional support.

There are also \\ncases of small, innocently miscalculated underpay-\\nments that turn into nightmares for homeowners and taxpayers alike. ( Perez v. County of Wayne, Mich. Cir. \\nCourt for County of Wayne , No. 19-009286-CZ  [$144 tax \\ndebt; county kept all $108,000 sales proceeds, 750 times the original debt]; Rafaeli, LLC v. Oakland \\nCounty (2020) 505 Mich. 429 [$8. 41 tax debt; county \\nkept all $24,500 sales proceeds, approximately 2,913 times the original debt].) Homeowners suffering from \\ndistress or mistake should not be disproportionally \\npunished by a total loss of  home equity\\u2014perhaps the \\nonly economic resource they have accrued\\u2014but should \\nbe provided a check for the remainder of what they \\nonce rightfully owned. It is a simple calculation and function of government to process such an incredible \\noverpayment. \\n Minnesota\\u2019s tax windfall here is approximately \\n$25,000 in \\u201cnet proceeds\\u201d from  the sale of Ms. Tyler\\u2019s \\ncondominium to satisfy he r delinquent property tax \\nbill. ( Tyler v. Hennepin Cty ., 26 F.4th at pp. 790-791.) \\nThe extensive current and hi storical legal support for \\nthese proceeds belonging to Ms. Tyler is well set out \\nin the Petition for Certiorari and will not be repeated \\n6 \\n here, except to concur that relevant takings jurispru-\\ndence directly applies. ( Koontz v. St. Johns River Water \\nManagement Dist . (2013) 570 U.S. 595; Webb\\u2019s Fabu-\\nlous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith  (1980) 449 U.S. 155.) \\n Minnesota\\u2019s tax windfall at Ms. Tyler\\u2019s expense \\nmust be reviewed. Amicus HJTA submits that the \\u201cvar-ious purposes\\u201d of Minnesota Statute section 282.08 \\n(Tyler v. Hennepin Cty ., 26 F.4th at p.  791) are clearly \\nthe same purposes for which taxes are imposed and collected. Accordingly, Minnesota has created a tax \\nloophole for its own benefit at a vulnerable home-\\nowner\\u2019s expense, a behavior that is repeated in many states as the Petition for Certiorari explains. Minne-\\nsota\\u2019s claim to Ms. Tyler\\u2019s $25,000 in home equity is \\neither a taking or an excessive punishment and any-thing else is fiction. Certior ari should be granted to \\nresolve the widespread problem afflicting American \\nhomeowners and the future of homeownership. \\n Even in states where the law recognizes a poten-\\ntial return of excess home equity, there is opportunity for government to under-prioritize the noticing proce-\\ndures and thereby increase the likelihood of taxing \\nauthorities quietly, passively retaining the funds that rightfully belong to the taxpayer. For example, in Cali-\\nfornia, proceeds are not automatically delivered, but \\nmust be claimed within one year. (Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7 4675(a).) Government bureaucracy can be slow or in-\\nefficient enough for notices to be misplaced or sent to \\nthe wrong address in that short time. Even when no-tices timely arrive at the right address, distressed for-\\nmer homeowners may\\u2014conveniently for California \\n7 \\n governments\\u2014not be in sufficient physical or mental \\ncondition to file a claim nor have the aid of someone \\nwho can. After one year with no claim filed, the prop-\\nerty belongs to the State of California, as it is in Min-\\nnesota. Clarity in this case would help California and \\nother states to clean up th eir tax collection laws to \\ncomport with the U.S. Constitution as it regards what is typically an American\\u2019s most vital asset and symbol \\nof financial stability and prosperity: a home. \\n \\nB. Minnesota\\u2019s tax windfall for county-\\nsupervised forest management, parks, \\nand general government services is de-\\nfinitively for \\u201cpublic use\\u201d and punishes Ms. Tyler for a lack of funds by taking significantly more than was owed. \\n Minnesota Statute section 282.08 would apportion \\nthe $25,000 \\u201cnet proceeds\\u201d of the Tyler tax sale to for-\\nest development, county parks and recreation, and un-restricted general government services. In fact, section \\n282.08 is titled \\u201c APPORTIONMENT OF PROCEEDS \\nTO TAXING DISTRICTS .\\u201d It is indisputable that \\nmoney transferred to a taxing district is for \\u201cpublic \\nuse\\u201d under the Fifth Amendment. That is the only pur-\\npose of such districts. \\n Ms. Tyler\\u2019s private property has been taken for \\n$25,000 worth of such public use, and similar incidents regularly occur across the country. Without review, \\ngovernments will continue to take tax windfalls out-\\nright, as Minnesota does by statute, or make room in \\n8 \\n statutes for clever designs or carelessness similarly ca-\\npable of producing unjustified windfalls at the expense \\nof the vulnerable. \\n Ms. Tyler did not have the money or the financial \\nsavvy to redeem the property , so the foreclosure pro-\\nceedings ensued. HJTA does not debate this. HJTA as-serts that Ms. Tyler\\u2019s prope rty has been taken and she \\nhas been excessively punished for having no money or \\nability to redeem the property, a state of being that is \\nnot even a disobedient act, much less a crime. Never-\\ntheless she has been fined, and the amount of her fine \\nis undoubtedly extreme. With the $40,000 sale of her home, Ms. Tyler paid her $15,000 debt (inclusive of ex-\\nisting penalties and interest) nearly 3 times. Given the \\neveryday prevalence of homeownership, hardship, and government use of tax sales on real property to satisfy \\ndebt, the Court should grant certiorari to make clear \\nin all states what is th e minimum standard under the \\nTakings Clause and/or whether this is an impermissi-\\nble, excessive punishment for unpaid taxes. \\n \\nII. The California Le gislature maintains a \\nvariant of the problem, also taking prop-\\nerty for \\u201cpublic use,\\u201d and demonstrates no \\ninclination to correct it. \\n Although California is not part of the extensive \\nsplit of authority among states on the parallel issue to \\nMs. Tyler\\u2019s, which immediately  speaks volumes as to \\nthe need for certiorari, California\\u2019s tax sales statutes demonstrate a more subtle abuse of homeowners. As \\n9 \\n the Petition for Certiorari briefly explained, \\u201c[Califor-\\nnia] law permits confiscation of the entire value when \\nmunicipalities claim the indebted property for a public \\nuse or economic revitalization.\\u201d (Pet. at 31.) Without clarification on certiorari, California\\u2019s laws taking \\nhome equity from vulnerable citizens will continue to \\nwreak havoc unchecked. \\n In California, a tax-defaulting homeowner gener-\\nally has one year to claim remaining home equity from a tax sale like the one Ms. Tyler\\u2019s property underwent. \\n(Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7 4675(a).) When property is \\nsold at a tax auction, and a claim is filed, disbursement \\nof the excess funds proceeds as follows: \\n(A) First, to lienholders of record prior to the \\nrecordation of the tax deed to the purchaser in \\nthe order of their priority. \\n(B) Second, to any person with title of record \\nto all or any portion of the property prior to \\nthe recordation of the tax deed to the pur-chaser. \\n(Id. at 4675(e).) \\n Though far from perfect, this provision comports \\nmore with the Constitution than does the Minnesota law in this case. \\n But there is another Ca lifornia law which causes \\nhome equity theft like Minnesota\\u2019s. Working with a \\nnonprofit organization, the st ate or a local government \\nmay file an \\u201cobjection\\u201d with the county tax collector to stop the open-market sa le under section 4675 and \\n10 \\n redirect the sale to exclus ive no-bid proceedings un-\\nder another statutory scheme. (Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\n\\u00a7 3695.4.) The state or local government may do this \\nfor \\u201cany property that is or may be needed for public use.\\u201d ( Ibid.) A nonprofit organization may also file an \\n\\u201cobjection\\u201d on its own to trigger such special proceed-\\nings by providing a written promise to sell or rent to low-income persons. (Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7 3695.5.) \\nIn these cases, not only are no proceeds returned to the \\nhomeowner, but the homeowner will not be able to claim their remaining home equity as they could have \\nwithin one year under section 4675 because it will be \\ntaken by design. Their remaining home equity is taken for \\u201cpublic use\\u201d by government, developers or nonprof-\\nits. (Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7 3695.4.) \\n This special procedure is known as a Chapter 8 \\nsale. (See Cal Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7\\u00a7 3771-3841.) The non-\\nprofit organization or government-partnered developer gains an exclusive agreement to purchase the property \\nfor just the total amount due to the government. ( Id. at \\n\\u00a7\\u00a7 3791.4; 3793.1.) This absorbs  the home equity be-\\ncause it is not an open-market sale. And home equity \\ninterests, similar to Ms. Tyler\\u2019s, are taken for \\u201cpublic \\nuse\\u201d thereby. (Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7 3695.4.) This clearly demands Fifth Amendment review. \\n California legislators, however, are unmotivated to \\nbring these statutes into compliance with the Takings \\nClause or Excessive Fines Clause. On February 7, 2022, \\nAssembly Bill 1839 was introduced. AB1839 would have required that an open public auction occur before \\nany Chapter 8 sale, thus at minimum affording every \\n11 \\n defaulted homeowner one chance to recover their re-\\nmaining home equity. The California Association of \\nCounty Treasurers and Tax Collectors supported the \\nbill, and no one opposed. (Assem. Com. On Rev. and Tax., Analysis of Assem. Bill. No. 1839 (2021-2022 Reg. \\nSess.) as amended Mar. 22, 202 2, at p. 3, Hearing Date \\nApril 25, 2022.) \\n Unfortunately, AB1839 died in committee on April \\n26, 2022. What is worse, other legislation had been simultaneously proposed to expand  the definition of \\nan eligible nonprofit under the Chapter 8 sales pro-\\nceedings, thus intending to make home equity theft more likely. (Assem. Com. on Rev. and Tax., Analysis \\nof Assem. Bill No. 2021 (2021-2022 Reg. Sess.) as \\namended April 7, 2022, at p. 1, Hearing Date April 25, 2022 [\\u201cExpands eligible uses for which a nonprofit or-\\nganization may object to a sale of tax-defaulted prop-\\nerty by public auction or sealed bid\\u201d].) California, along with Minnesota and the many other states discussed \\nin the Petition for Certiorari,  sorely need application of \\nthe Takings Clause and Excessive Fines Clause to re-turn home equity proceeds to distressed homeowners \\nfollowing the sales of their homes to repay tax debts. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nCONCLUSION \\n In all its forms, home equity theft violates the Tak-\\nings and Excessive Fines Clauses as a fictitious wind-fall to government or exclusive government-appointed \\nbidders. Without certiorari in Ms. Tyler\\u2019s case against \\n12 \\n Minnesota\\u2019s outright retention of her $25,000, states \\nlike California will slip further into patterns and prac-\\ntices violating the Fifth and Eighth Amendments as \\nto their most vulnerable citi zens. Certiorari should be \\ngranted. \\nDATED: September 21, 2022 \\nRespectfully submitted, \\nJONATHAN  M. C OUPAL  \\nTIMOTHY  A. B ITTLE  \\nLAURA  E.

This Court should hold \\nthat such an appeal divests the district court of ju-\\nrisdiction and requires a mandatory stay of all liti-\\ngation.  \\nArbitration and litigation are distinct mecha-\\nnisms of dis pute resolution. They  cannot coexist. \\nParties choose arbitration to avoid litigation. Once \\na party has been forced to litigate, this purpose is \\ndestroyed. The loud, resonating bell of litigation, \\nonce heard by all, cannot be un -rung.3 Its course \\n \\n 3 Levin v. Alms & Assocs., I nc., 634  F.3d 260, 265 (4th \\nCir. 2011).  \\n3 \\nand its ef fects remain even if an appellate court re-\\nverses. Parties who litigate will suffer the conse-\\nquences, whatever they may be.  \\nThe Ninth Circuit (along with the Second and \\nFifth Circuits) has adopted an untenable rule that \\nwill adversely impact the bargained -for rights of \\nmillion s of American businesses and individuals \\nwho are parties to arbitration agreements in many \\ndiverse industries and contexts. Since the 1990s, \\nthe use of arbitration clauses in consumer, em-\\nployment, and commercial contracts has increased .   \\nGiven the prolife ration of arbitration, the Ninth \\nCircuit\\u2019s holding goes far beyond affecting business \\ninterests. Recent scholarship explains an effort by \\nplaintiff -claimants and their sophisticated attor-\\nneys to seize upon arbitration provisions in com-\\nmonplace consumer agr eements. Those claimants \\nseek to \\u201cturn the tables\\u201d on business interests by \\nusing arbitration agreements to file mass arbitra-\\ntions strategically intended to overwhelm and dis-\\nrupt the operations of their opponents. Put simply, \\nthis issu e affects a significa nt number of U.S. peo-\\nple and businesses and is not unique to businesses.  \\nThere are valid reasons why parties prefer arbi-\\ntration. Like Petitioner Coinbase, Inc., a party who \\nbargains for arbitration may seek streamlined, \\nfaster procedur es; control (such as input on the de-\\ncisionmaker); limitations on invasive and costly  \\ninter -party, third -party, and expert discovery; add-\\ned protections for confidential information; less  \\nadversarial and more collaborative adjudications; \\n4 \\nand final resoluti ons without the risk of protracted \\nappeal.  \\nCivil lawsuits in federal court, by contrast, are \\nnot as predictable. Litigation comes with broad dis-\\ncovery and unpredictable delay. Positions are \\nstaked out early on as one side or the other scores \\nwins in pretri al motions and deposi tions held long \\nbefore trial. Cases are more easily won on technical \\nvictories. No one person has any final say about \\nhow a lawsuit will take its course. Any given law-\\nsuit has a life of its own, often experiencing a form \\nof self -propel led but uncontrolled mom entum.  \\nThere are ripple effects. These costs of litigation \\npersist even if an appeal is won and a case is trans-\\nferred to arbitration after a period of forced litiga-\\ntion. This includes direct costs such as attorney \\nfees, expert fees , and litigation expe nses. There are \\nalso indirect costs. Indirect costs include disposi-\\ntive changes to the probable substantive outcome \\nresulting from, for example, damning discovery dis-\\nclosures, dismissals for technicalities, and pretrial \\nrulings that ch ange the course, tone , and tenor of \\nthe case \\u2014all of which might not have happened in \\narbitration.  \\nThe minority position says these concerns beg \\nthe question. After all, a defendant who loses on \\nappeal had no right to arbitrate to begin with and \\nthat defen dant has already lost  once. If the appel-\\nlate court affirms, then the plaintiff will be preju-\\ndiced by having to wait. That may be. But a \\nplaintiff who is asked to hold tight \\u2014and to wait on-\\n5 \\nly for the time it takes to have an appeal decided \\u2014\\ndoes not suffer th e same risk of harm. Delay is not \\nlike the permanent, possibly irreparable harm as-\\nsociated with discovery, case dynamics, and party \\npositioning in civil litigation undertaken while a \\ncase is on appeal on the issue of arbitrability.  \\nA defendant seeking  an interlocutory appeal  \\nunder Section 16(a) of the FAA is asking for protec-\\ntion from the permanent and un -windable litiga-\\ntion process (which it argues it contracted to avoid) \\nduring the limited time when arbitrability is an \\nopen question. Such a defendan t is not asking to \\narbitrate the dispute in the face of a loss, while on \\nappeal. Delay alone does not outweigh the pre-\\nsumptive prejudice to the party seeking to enforce \\narbitration. Where the very function of arbitration \\nis to avoid litigation and where th e issue on appeal \\nis whether litigation can proceed, the defendant \\nshould not have to bear the burden and costs of lit-\\nigation before that question is finally determined.  \\nThis conclusion is buttressed by the differences \\nin reversal rates between appeals fr om denials of \\narbitration as compared to appeals in civil cases as \\na whole. Scholars observe that circuit courts re-\\nversed approximately half of cases involving deni-\\nals of arbitration (as compared to a mere 10 to 20% \\nof civil cases as a whole, depending on the year ex-\\namined). This statistic is no surprise, however, as \\nit accords with the strong legislative policy in favor \\nof arbitration. This policy would predictably gener-\\nate more reversals of denials of arbitration.   \\n6 \\nThe majority rule better serves the rel evant in-\\nterests of both individuals/consumers and busi-\\nnesses. Further, a clear, bright -line rule better \\nserves the liberal federal public policy favoring ar-\\nbitration and federal court judicial economy. The \\nautomatic stay rule and the divestiture principle \\nare such rules. They promote judicial economy by \\nfreeing up district court resources while cases are \\non appeal and by preventing needless expenditure \\nof district court resources on litigating applications \\nfor discretionary stay. These principles promote \\nconsistency of rulings between trial and appellate \\ncourts. They also advance the form and structure of \\nthe federal civil justice system with its unique \\nfunctions of district and appellate courts.  \\nThe Ninth Circuit got it wrong when it held that \\na district c ourt retains jurisdiction to proceed with \\nlitigation despite a non -frivolous appeal of the de-\\nnial of a motion to compel arbitration. The Third, \\nFourth, Seventh, Tenth, Eleventh, and D.C. Cir-\\ncuits decided the issue correctly when they found \\nthat an interloc utory appeal under Section 16(a) of \\nthe Federal Arbitration Act automatically divests \\nthe district court of jurisdiction and requires a \\ncomplete stay of all litigation. The Ninth Circuit \\nshould be reversed. Its opinion should be vacated.  \\n7 \\nARGUMENT  \\nI.

The Weingarten  court observes that \\nengaging in discovery, which would occur absent an automat-\\nic stay, could irreparably harm the party seeking the sta y be-\\ncaus e of the potential for substantial cost increases due to \\ndiscovery, and more importantly, the p ossibility of revealing \\nsensitive information that could corrode the parties\\u2019 right to \\narbitrate.  \\n 37 Michael P.

No principle compels \\nsuch an anomalous result, and this Court should not \\ncreate an Article III except ion that excludes nominal-\\ndamages awards from ordinary justiciability rules. \\nThe officials do not contest that their actions \\ncaused Chike and Joseph real injury. Their argument is that nominal damages do not redress past injuries. \\nBut nominal damages vindic ate constitutional viola-\\ntions, including where the harm is not quantifiable. \\nMemphis Cmty. Sch. Dist. v. Stachura , 477 U.S. 299, \\n308 n.11 (1986) (quoting Carey v. Piphus , 435 U.S. \\n247, 266 (1978)). And contrary to the Eleventh Circuit's belief, they do so \\\"for the plaintiff's benefit.\\\" \\nFarrar v. Hobby , 506 U.S. 103, 113 (1992). Those \\nprinciples, common-law history, and common sense all show that a nominal-damages award provides a \\npersonal, tangible benefit that redresses a plaintiff's \\ninjury. Article III requires nothing more. \\nProviding a remedy to plaintiffs like Chike and \\nJoseph has neither flooded the courts with lawsuits \\nnor bankrupted officials in the many circuits that \\nallow standalone nominal-damages awards. Nominal \\ndamages, like compensato ry damages, have \\\"coex-\\nisted with our constitutional system since the dawn of the Republic.\\\" Tanzin v. Tanvir , __ S. Ct. __, 2020 WL \\n7250100, at 5 (Dec. 10, 2020). And a nation of laws \\nrequires  a way for courts to make things right when \\nofficials violate rights. Because nominal-damages claims satisfy Arti cle III, this Court should reverse. \\n2 \\nREPLY ARGUMENT  \\nI. T h i s  C o u r t  s h o u l d  d e c l i n e  t o  c r e a t e  a n  \\nArticle III exception that excludes nominal-\\ndamages awards from ordinary justicia-\\nbility rules. \\nThe officials do not deny that Chike and Joseph \\nsuffered a concrete injury-in-fact, nor do they deny \\ncausation. Their only objection is redressability. In making that objection, they confuse redressability \\nwith quantifiability . Because nominal damages \\nvindicate past legal violations, Chike and Joseph's nominal-damages claims s atisfy Article III and are \\nnot moot. \\nA. Nominal damages redress past constitu-\\ntional injury. \\nArticle III standing requires  a plaintiff to show he \\nhas suffered (1) a concrete and particularized injury-\\nin-fact, (2) caused by the defendant, (3) that is likely \\nto be redressed by a favorable court ruling. Spokeo, \\nInc. v. Robins , 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016). The \\nofficials do not dispute injury or causation. And \\nredressability requires only that a plaintiff personally \\n\\\"benefit in a tangible way from\\\" court intervention. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't , 523 U.S. 83, \\n103 n.5 (1998) (quotation omitted). A plaintiff \\nsatisfies that test by showing that a court order would \\n\\\"partially redress\\\" his injury. Meese v. Keene , 481 U.S. \\n465, 476 (1987). Nominal-damages awards, though \\nsmall, satisfy that standard.\\n1 \\n \\n1 The officials articulate a second redressability requirement: \\nthat the relief \\\"target and redress the plaintiff's asserted injury\\\" \\nrather than someone else's. Resp.Br.12. But that is no different \\nthan requiring that the remedy \\\"personally\\\" benefit the plaintiff. \\n3 \\nThe officials confuse redressability with quanti-\\nfiability. Consider a studen t who shared her faith on \\ncampus by chalking messages about Jesus Christ on \\nthe sidewalk, only to see a professor direct his class to erase them.\\n2 Even if the officials modified their \\npolicies to prevent this First Amendment violation \\nfrom happening again, the officials admit that this student could litigate to final judgment her 1\\u00a2 \\ncompensatory-damages claim for the consumed chalk. \\nEven a single penny of relief partially benefits the stu-dent personally and in a tangible way. \\nNow consider Chike. The officials do not dispute \\nhe was injured when they twice stopped him from speaking. The problem is that he cannot monetize the \\nlost speech's value. But Chike's lost speech is far more \\nvaluable than the consumed chalk. And it is the lost \\nspeech that gives Chike the right to seek judicial \\nredress; the $1 in nominal damages that officials \\nmust pay Chike is no less a partial redress that personally and tangibly benefits him than is the \\npenny that redresses the chalk user. A nominal-\\ndamages award \\\"modifies th e defendant's behavior \\nfor the plaintiff's benefit by forcing the defendant to \\npay an amount of money he otherwise would not pay.\\\" \\nFarrar , 506 U.S. at 113. And in this way, the payment \\nof nominal damages \\\"materially alters\\\" the parties' \\nlegal relationship, id. at 111\\u201312, in the same way as \\na modest compensatory-damages award. \\n \\n \\n2 Compare with Fresno State Students for Life  v. Thatcher , No. \\n1:17-at-00382 (E.D. Cal.), available at https://perma.cc/566E-\\n6EBZ. . \\n4 \\nThe officials say that whil e one dollar in compen-\\nsatory damages redresses a past injury, one dollar in \\nnominal damages does not. Resp.Br.17\\u201319. Again, \\nthis is confusion over quantifiability. Contra City of \\nRiverside v. Rivera , 477 U.S. 561, 574 (1986) \\n(plaintiff's vindication of \\\"important civil and \\nconstitutional rights that cannot be valued solely in monetary terms\\\"). Courts  award nominal damages \\nprimarily when there has been an \\\"infraction of a \\nlegal right\\\" but the \\\"extent of loss is not shown.\\\" C\\nHARLES T. MCCORMICK , HANDBOOK ON THE LAW OF \\nDAMAGES  \\u00a7 20 at 85 (1935). So it's not that nominal \\ndamages offer \\\" zero legally recognized relief for a past \\ninjury,\\\" Resp.Br.19 (emphasis added), it's that they \\noffer partial relief. Skyline Wesleyan Church v. Cal. \\nDep't of Managed Health Care , 968 F.3d 738, 749 (9th \\nCir. 2020) (\\\"Nominal damages would redress \\nSkyline's injury, even if only to a minimal extent.\\\"). \\nAnd because nominal dama ges \\\"materially alter[  ]\\\" \\nthe parties' relationship, Farrar , 506 U.S. at 111\\u201312, \\nthat is sufficient for Article III. Meese , 481 U.S. at 476. \\n\\\"Nothing more is needed to establish redressability.\\\" Skyline , 968 F.3d at 749. Otherwise, justiciability of \\nidentical claims turns on mere semantics. ACLU Br. \\n11\\u201312 (discussing Freenor v. Mayor & Alderman of \\nSavannah , No. CV414-247, 2019 WL 9936663 (S.D. \\nGa. May 20, 2019)). \\nAs this Court intimated in Carey , nominal dam-\\nages make a constitutional deprivation \\\"actionable.\\\" \\n435 U.S. at 266. That is because they redress a plain-\\ntiff's concrete and particula rized injury in a personal, \\ntangible way. U.S.Br.17\\u201319 (same result if Congress \\nauthorized a minimum $1,000 award for First \\nAmendment violations). A nominal-damages award partially redresses a loss of incalculable value. \\n5 \\nB. This Court's decisions confirm that \\nnominal damages' primary purpose is \\npast redress of valuable\\u2014even \\npriceless\\u2014rights. \\nNominal damages\\u2014like other remedies\\u2014have \\nmultiple effects that can include the declaration of \\nrights or the protection of prospective rights. But this \\nCourt's precedents and numerous lower-court \\ndecisions show that nominal damages' primary \\npurpose is to redress past legal violations. \\nCarey  decided that nominal damages, rather than \\npresumed damages, were the appropriate award for \\nconstitutional violations where harm cannot be mon-etized. 435 U.S. at 266. But the context was not \\\"pro-\\nspective redress.\\\" Contra Resp.Br.24. It was about \\nremedying a past \\\"deprivation\\\" of rights. 435 U.S. at \\n266. That is why the Court did not speak in terms of \\nany \\\"prospective\\\" due-process problem but to the past \\n\\\"denial of procedur al due process.\\\" Ibid. Accord, e.g., \\nStachura , 477 U.S. at 308 & n.11 (same point in free-\\nspeech context); Arizonans for Official English v. \\nArizona , 520 U.S. 43, 69 & n.24 (1997) (contrasting \\nnominal damages and injunctive relief). \\nLikewise, in Farrar , the plaintiff dropped a claim \\nfor injunctive relief and pursued only an unsuccessful compensatory-damages claim.  506 U.S. at 106. In \\ndetermining that a nominal-damages award made the \\nplaintiff a prevailing party under \\u00a7  1983, this Court \\nemphasized that \\\" Carey  obligates a court to award \\nnominal damages when a plaintiff establishes the \\nviolation of his [constitutional] right.\\\" Id. at 112. That \\nis, this Court correctly saw the award of nominal \\ndamages as retrospective redress, not prospective \\nprotection. \\n6 \\nUnsurprisingly, lower courts have consistently \\nrelied on this Court's cases to hold that a plaintiff \\nwhose constitutional rights have been violated \\n\\\"should not lose his right to proceed\\\" if \\\"only nominal damages are at stake.\\\" Amato v. City of Saratoga \\nSprings , 170 F.3d 311, 319 (2d Cir. 1999) (discussing \\nCarey ). Petitioners' opening brief discussed many \\nsuch cases. Pet.Br.27\\u201328. Yet the officials fail to \\nrespond to many. There are more examples, in count-\\nless settings. E.g., ACLU Br. 13\\u201319; Found. for \\nIndividual Rights in Educ. [FIRE] Br. 5\\u20139; Becket Fund Br. 20\\u201325; Pacific Legal Found. Br. 1\\u20134, 12\\u201316.  \\nThe officials' rule also vi olates this Court's prece-\\ndent in analogous contexts. For example, the officials \\ninsist that statutory damages are \\\"different in kind\\\" \\nbecause they \\\"do not signify nothing .\\\" Resp.Br.19\\u201320. \\nBut statutory and nominal damages serve the same \\npurpose: providing \\\"recompense for injury\\\" where \\n\\\"the rules of law render diff icult or impossible proof of \\ndamages.\\\" Douglas v. Cunningham , 294 U.S. 207, 209 \\n(1935). The officials concede that it \\\"is good enough \\nfor Article III\\\" when Congre ss sets statutory damages \\nwhere it \\\"might be hard to measure\\\" actual damages. \\nResp.Br.19\\u201320. It is no different when courts award \\nnominal damages for the same reason. \\nThe same is true of liquidated damages, which \\nassign a fixed value to harm where actual damages \\n\\\"may be difficult or impossible to ascertain.\\\" Rex \\nTrailer Co. v. United States , 350 U.S. 148, 153\\u201354 \\n(1956). And punitive dama ges are non-compensatory \\nand sometimes awarded without compensatory harm. U.S.Br.19\\u201320. Yet the offici als do not dispute that a \\nplaintiff with a standalone claim for statutory, \\nliquidated, or punitive da mages has failed to present \\nan Article III case or controversy. \\n7 \\nThe officials criticize Chike and Joseph for \\nequating \\\"vindication\\\" of rights with Article III \\nredress. Resp.Br.21\\u201323. But where \\\"there has been a \\nviolation of a right, the person injured is entitled to an action. If he is entitled to an action, he is entitled \\nat least to nominal damages,  or else he would not be \\nentitled to a recovery.\\\" Parker v. Griswold , 17 Conn. \\n288, 303 (1846). \\nC. At common law, courts routinely award-\\ned standalone nominal damages solely to redress past injuries. \\nNo one disputes that English and American \\ncommon-law courts consistently adjudicated claims for nominal damages in a wide array of cases, and \\nthat such claims arose from a past violation of rights. \\nYet the officials insist that when common-law courts \\ndid award nominal damages, it was only for \\ncontinuing or threatened injuries. Resp.Br.28\\u201340. \\nCenturies of cases debunk this theory. \\nFor one thing, the officials concede that entire cat-\\negories of common-law cases involved the award of \\nnominal damages even \\\"whe n they would not plainly \\nserve as prospective relief.\\\" Id. at 34. These include \\ncases (like this one) when the plaintiff \\\"proved a legal \\nviolation\\\" but failed to establish or quantify compensatory damages, ibid. , \\\"as a vehicle for costs,\\\" \\nid. at 32\\u201334, or for \\\"dignitary harms,\\\" id. at 38. And \\nthese categories of cases\\u2014which alone undermine the officials' historical analysis\\u2014are just a few examples. \\nEnglish courts inferred nominal damages when-\\never the plaintiff establish ed an invasion of a legal \\nright, no matter if ther e was a continuing or \\nthreatened injury. \\\"[I]njury imports a damage, \\nthough it does not cost the party one farthing.\\\" Ashby  \\n8 \\nv. White , 92 Eng. Rep. 126, 137 (1703) (Holt, J.). \\nCourts \\\"import[ed] a dama ge\\\" for various claims, \\nincluding breach of contract, trespass, and personal \\ninjury. Ibid.  (\\\"a cuff on the ear\\\" would be actionable \\n\\\"for it is a personal injury\\\").  \\nFor personal rights, nominal damages served to \\nremedy past harms, not to  protect against future \\ninjury. In Ashby , for example, the House of Lords held \\nthat an elector who was wrongfully turned away from \\nthe polls by an official could sue without proving the \\\"possibility of a future profi t\\\" or the \\\"possibility of a \\nfuture\\\" damage. 87 Eng. Rep. 810, 810, 813 (1703) \\n(Powell, J., & Gould, J.). Often these violations occurred when an official fa iled to perform his duty \\nbut cured the defect before suit. In these cases, plain-\\ntiffs could still recover nominal damages for the past \\ninjury even though they had no need for prospective \\nrelief. E.g., Barker v. Green , 130 Eng. Rep. 327, 327 \\n(1824) (sheriff's one-day delay in arrest on writ); Bales \\nv. Wingfield , 4 Q.B. 580, n. (multi-week delay by \\nsheriff in executing a lien writ); Clifton  v. Hooper , 115 \\nEng. Rep. 175, 175, 178 (1844) (sheriff delay in exe-cuting process). This was al so true for actions brought \\nagainst private citizens. E.g., Marzetti v. Williams , \\n109 Eng. Rep. 842, 845\\u201347 (1830) (one-day delay in issuing check); Godefroy  v. Jay, 131 Eng. Rep. 159, \\n159\\u201362 (1831) (client could receive nominal damages \\nfor attorney's negligence). \\nAmerican courts followed suit. Plaintiffs could \\nrecover at least nominal damages for injuries caused \\nby public officials without showing the threat of future harm. E.g.,  Mickles v. Hart , 1 Denio 548, 550 \\n(N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1845) (sheriff deputy's delay in \\nexecuting debt); Laflin v. Willard , 33 Mass. 64, 67 \\n(1835) (same); Waterhouse v. Waite , 11 Mass. 207, 210 \\n9 \\n(1814) (same); Burns v. Erben , 26 How. Pr. 273, 277 \\n(N.Y. Super. Ct. 1864) (false imprisonment); Doherty  \\nv. Munson , 127 Mass. 495, 496 (1879) (detention \\nunder illegal warrant). And American courts routinely awarded nominal damages in private \\nactions when such an award could provide no \\nprospective relief. E.g., Thompson  v. New Orleans, J. \\n& G.N.R. Co. , 50 Miss. 315, 320 (1874) (train \\nconductor passed passenger's stop by two miles); \\nCrosby v. Humphreys , 60 N.W. 843, 844 (Minn. 1894) \\n(assault); Young v. W. Union Tel. Co. , 11 S.E. 1044, \\n1044\\u201345 (N.C. 1890) (negligent delay in delivering \\ntelegraph); McKim  v. Bartlett , 129 Mass. 226, 229 \\n(1880) (estate administrator liable for at least nomi-nal damages after court discharged future liability).  \\nThis partial list shows that early American \\ncourts\\u2014like their English counterparts\\u2014undeniably \\nawarded nominal damages so lely for past injuries. \\nAccord, e.g., U.S.Br.10\\u201311; Nat'l Right to Work Legal \\nDef. Found. Br. 4\\u201310. \\nEven a nominal-damages award in a trespass, \\nriparian-rights, or other pr operty case was intended, \\nfirst and foremost, to vindicate the past \\\"violation of \\nthe plaintiff's right.\\\" Delaware & Hudson Canal Co.  \\nv. Torrey , 33 Pa. 143, 148 (1859); accord Embrey v. \\nOwen , 155 Eng. Rep. 579, 585 (1851) (same). And that \\nis why common-law courts awarded nominal damages \\nin property cases even when the parties' future rights \\nand obligations were not at stake. E.g., Hefley  v. \\nBaker , 19 Kan. 9, 11 (1877) (pure trespass case with \\nno property-line dispute); Curtis v. Paggett , 27 P. 109, \\n109\\u201310 (Kan. 1891) (same); Cook v. Loomis , 26 Conn. \\n483, 486 (1857) (trover case where property already \\nreturned); Mears v. Cornwall , 40 N.W. 931, 932\\u201334 \\n(Mich. 1888) (same); Warder v. Baldwin , 8 N.W. 257, \\n10 \\n258 (Wis. 1881) (same); Moon v. Raphael , 132 Eng. \\nRep. 122, 122 (1835) (same). And plaintiffs at common \\nlaw could waive their right to compensatory damages \\nand choose to seek nominal damages alone. Pet.Br.42; \\naccord Daniels v. Bates , 2 Greene 151, 152 (Iowa \\n1849); Pastorius v. Fisher , 1 Rawle 27, 29 (Pa. 1828). \\nThe officials' failure to address so many of these \\ncases is no mere oversight. Many are on all fours with \\nthe constitutional violations at issue here and \\nestablish the common-law ru le that nominal damages \\nsupport a claim for past constitutional violations. So \\ndo cases involving intentional torts. Frederick \\nDouglass Found. Br. 6\\u20138 (c omparing Petitioners' \\ninjuries to those caused by intentional torts, for which \\ncourts awarded nominal damages); Stachura , 477 \\nU.S. at 306 (level of \\u00a7  1983 damages \\\"determined \\naccording to principles de rived from the common law \\nof torts\\\"). \\nThe officials say that, even if common-law courts \\nawarded nominal damages with no \\\"prospective \\nremedial benefits,\\\" such awards were meaningless \\nand insufficient \\\"for maintaining an action.\\\" Resp.Br.35\\u201336. But as detailed above, countless cases \\nheld that a standalone nominal-damages claim \\nsustained a case having no effect on future rights. It would be passing strange for so many courts, over so \\nmany years, to adjudicate  nominal-damages claims \\nthat they thought served no purpose and, in the officials' view, violated redressability requirements. \\nFinally, while early common-law courts may have \\nbeen unwilling to reverse a trial court's failure to award nominal damages in trifling or frivolous cases, \\nResp.Br.34\\u201335; Fleming  v. Gilbert , 3 Johns 528, 532 \\n(N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1808); Robertson v. Gentry , 5 Ky. 542, \\n11 \\n543 (Ct. App. 1812), that reluctance faded when \\n\\\"important\\\" rights were at stake. Blackburn v. Ala. \\nGreat S. R. Co. , 39 So. 345, 346 (Ala. 1905); Hecht  v. \\nHarrison , 40 P. 306, 309\\u201310 (Wyo. 1895). Modern \\ncourts view nominal damages the same way when a \\nplaintiff alleges a constitutional violation. E.g., Risdal \\nv. Halford , 209 F.3d 1071, 1073 (8th Cir. 2000) \\n(reversing for plain error because the district court \\nfailed to instruct the jury  to award nominal damages \\nif it found a free-speech violation); Zok v. State , 903 \\nP.2d 574, 579 (Alaska 1995) (failure to award nominal \\ndamages for unlawful arrest was plain error because \\nthe \\\"right to be free from unlawful confinement is sufficiently important and fundamental in our \\nsociety\\\"). Indeed, circuit co urts uniformly hold that an \\naward of nominal damages is mandatory upon \\nproving a constitutional violation. Pet.Br.30\\u201331 n.4 \\n(collecting cases). The officials' cramped theory of \\nnominal damages cannot explain away this history. \\nD. Nominal damages are not a mere \\nanalogue for declaratory relief. \\nNominal damages' primary purpose is to redress \\na past injury. Yet the officials continue to assert that \\n\\\"[d]eclaratory judgments are the analogue,\\\" \\nResp.Br.41, unless sovereign or qualified immunity is at stake, in which case th e officials feel differently, id. \\nat 42 n.3. The officials are incorrect. U.S.Br.23\\u201327. \\nTo be sure, \\\"all judgments of courts declare jural \\nrelations.\\\" Edwin M. Borchard, The Declaratory \\nJudgment\\u2014A Needed Procedural Reform , 28 Y\\nALE \\nL.J. 1, 4 (1918). Yet courts do not equate all forms of \\nrelief with declaratory judgments just because they share this one trait. \\n12 \\nNor do the officials rebut the many other differ-\\nences between declaratory judgments and nominal \\ndamages that unravel their flawed analogy. First, \\nnominal damages are legal relief, while declaratory judgments are equitable. Resp.Br.42 n.3. Second, \\ndeclaratory judgments were designed to determine \\nlegal rights \\\" before breach .\\\" Edwin M. Borchard, The \\nUniform Act on Declaratory Judgments , 34 H\\nARV. L. \\nREV. 697, 707 (1921). Nominal damages remedy past \\nharm, unavailable until an injury has occurred. C\\nHARLES T. MCCORMICK , HANDBOOK ON THE LAW OF \\nDAMAGES  \\u00a7 20 at 85 (1935) (\\\"Nominal damages are \\nawarded for the infraction of a legal right.\\\"). \\nThird, declaratory judgments are primarily \\nprospective relief, Christian Legal Soc'y v. Martinez , \\n561 U.S. 661, 676 n.6 (2010), while nominal damages, \\nwhich require a past violation, are primarily retro-\\nspective, Arizonans for Official English , 520 U.S. at \\n69 & n.24.   Fourth, the Declaratory Judgment Act \\n\\\"confers a discretion  on the courts,\\\" not an \\\"absolute \\nright upon the litigant.\\\" Wilton v. Seven Falls Co. , 515 \\nU.S. 277, 287 (1995). Nominal damages are manda-tory. Farrar , 506 U.S. at 112 (\\\" Carey obligate[d] a \\ncourt to award nominal damages when a plaintiff \\nestablishes the violation of his right\\\"). And finally, \\nunlike declaratory judgments,  courts have held that \\nnominal damages are subject to sovereign- and \\nqualified-immunity defenses. E.g., Am. Civil Liberties \\nUnion v. U.S. Conf. of Cath. Bishops , 705 F.3d 44, 53 \\nn.7 (1st Cir. 2013) (sovereign immunity); Hopkins v. \\nSaunders , 199 F.3d 968, 978 (8th Cir. 1999) (qualified \\nimmunity). \\nIn sum, the disparities between declaratory judg-\\nments and nominal damages are stark. And rightly \\nso, as their primary purpose is decidedly different. \\n13 \\nE. The officials' view of nominal damages \\ncontradicts Article III requirements. \\nRationalizing some of the many instances in \\nwhich common-law courts awarded nominal damages \\nfor the past violation of rights, the officials argue that \\nthe \\\"jurisdictional hook\\\" is \\\"the plaintiff's live claim \\nfor compensatory damages.\\\" Resp.Br.26. This hook saves a nominal-damages claim from mootness, say \\nthe officials, even if the plaintiff's compensatory-\\ndamages claim fail s on the merits. Ibid.  That \\nreasoning cannot be right. \\nTo begin, \\\"a plaintiff must demonstrate standing \\nfor each claim he seeks to press and for each form of relief that is sought.\\\" Town of Chester v. Laroe Ests., \\nInc., 137 S. Ct. 1645, 1650 (2017) (citation omitted). It \\nis impossible for a compensatory-damage remedy to \\nbe a \\\"jurisdictional hook\\\" for a separate, moot remedy. \\nA nominal-damages remedy mu st (and does) stand on \\nits own merits from the case's inception. \\nIn addition, \\\"an actual controversy must be extant \\nat all stages of review, not merely at the time the com-\\nplaint is filed.\\\" Arizonans for Official English , 520 \\nU.S. at 67 (citation omitted). Once a plausible claim \\nfor compensatory damages fail s at the merits stage, it \\nis again impossible for that claim to be a \\\"jurisdictional hook\\\" for a separate, moot claim. \\nMoreover, a plaintiff must quantify injury to \\nclaim compensatory damage s. Yet the loss of First \\nAmendment freedoms like speech and religious \\nexercise constitutes \\\"irreparable injury.\\\" Roman \\nCatholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , __ S. Ct. __, \\n2020 WL 6948354, at 3 (Nov. 25, 2020). Such injury \\n\\\"cannot be adequately measured or compensated by \\nmoney.\\\" Irreparable Injury , B\\nLACK 'S LAW DICTIONARY  \\n14 \\n(11th ed. 2019). The officials' position would lead to \\nthe indefensible result that the appropriate remedy \\nfor a past violation of rights is one that in some cases \\nwill not be available. \\nFinally, the officials' position deprives some \\nvictims of government misconduct of any remedy. The \\nofficials say that without plausible compensatory-damages remedies, plaintiffs can still \\\"vindicate their \\nrights through claims for prospective relief like \\ninjunctions and declaratory judgments.\\\" Resp.Br.46\\u201348. But that only underscor es the correctness of Chike \\nand Joseph's position: that eliminating the nominal-\\ndamages remedy would allo w officials to make a \\nstrategic post-filing change in policy solely to moot \\nprospective relief. Such a risk is real because \\ngovernment officials have strong incentives to moot \\ncases. Becket Fund Br. 8\\u201314; Joseph C. Davis & \\nNicholas R. Reaves, The Point Isn't Moot: How Lower \\nCourts Have Blessed Go vernment Abuse of the \\nVoluntary-Cessation Doctrine , 129 Y\\nALE L.J.  FORUM  \\n325 (2019). The officials propose a phantom remedy to \\ninsulate their unconstitutional acts from legal accountability. \\n  \\n15 \\nII. The officials' reasons for creating a nominal-\\ndamages exception to Article III are indefensible. \\nThe officials predict dire  effects if this Court \\nallows partial redress for the violation of Chike and \\nJoseph's rights. Yet it ha s been \\\"widely recognized\\\" \\nfor ages \\\"that a claim for nominal damages precludes mootness\\\" based on later events. N.Y. State Rifle & \\nPistol Ass'n v. City of N.Y. , 140 S. Ct. 1525, 1536 \\n(2020) (Alito, J., dissenting); Pet.Br.14 n.2 (catalog-uing eight circuits' rule). None of these asserted \\nconsequences have material ized in the jurisdictions \\nthat have rejected the Eleventh Circuit's novel and indefensible approach. The officials' arguments lack \\nmerit. \\nA. The majority rule does not require \\nadvisory opinions. \\nThe officials say that nominal-damages claims \\ninvite advisory opinions. Resp.Br. 2, 9\\u201310, 22, 41\\u201342. Not so. To quote the officials' own cases, advisory opinions \\\"advis[e] what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\\\" Aetna Life Ins. Co. of \\nHartford v. Haworth , 300 U.S. 227, 241 (1937). \\nAccord, e.g., Preiser v. Newkirk , 422 U.S. 395, 401 \\n(1975) (same);  Ashcroft v. Mattis , 431 U.S. 171, 172 \\n(1977) (per curiam). That's not the request here. \\nChike and Joseph present real-world facts and \\n\\\"concrete legal issues, presented in [an] actual case[  ],\\\" \\nGolden v. Zwickler , 394 U.S. 103, 108 (1969): whether \\nofficials violated their free -speech rights. It is not \\nclear why the officials believe that question is more hypothetical here than if Chike's speech had con-sumed 1\\u00a2 of chalk, particularly when the officials do \\n16 \\nnot contest he suffered a cognizable injury-in-fact. \\nThere is nothing advisory about deciding the question \\nand awarding nominal damages. Young Ams. for \\nLiberty Br. 12; Christia n Legal Soc'y Br. 5\\u20136. \\nB. The majority rule does not eliminate the \\nmootness doctrine. \\nThe longstanding majority rule has not \\\"swal-\\nlowed\\\" the mootness doctrine in the eight circuits that \\nfollow it. Contra Resp.Br.43\\u201345. Many constitutional \\ncases seek only prospectiv e relief, either because \\ndamages are barred by sovereign immunity or because the injury is threatened or imminent but has not yet occurred at the time of filing. The mootness doctrine is alive and well for those cases. The \\nsituation here\\u2014where the officials already violated \\nChike's and Joseph's constitutional rights\\u2014presents \\nthe flip side of mootness: fed eral courts are obligated \\nto adjudicate live controversies. Knox v. Serv. Emps. \\nInt'l Union, Local 1000 , 567 U.S. 298, 307\\u201308 (2012). \\nPlus, the officials' concer n for the vitality of the \\nmootness doctrine is selective. They concede that the \\ndoctrine has not crumbled ev en though a plaintiff can \\navoid mootness by seeking compensation for negli-gible financial damages. Resp.Br.49. So, it will not disintegrate if a plaintiff seeks justice without putting \\nhimself and the courts through the trouble and \\ndisproportionate expense of monetizing, proving, and \\nassessing those injuries, as long experience in the courts of appeals attests. Ar ticle III does not require \\nplaintiffs to repackage no minal-damages claims as \\nsmall damages claims. Both types of claims ensure a \\nlive controversy. \\n17 \\nFar more troublesome problems arise under the \\nofficials' rule, which allows governments to moot \\ncases unilaterally and strategically. That approach \\nallows officials to reinstate unconstitutional policies, a phenomenon that the amici have well documented. \\nFIRE Br. 24\\u201327; Becket Fund Br. 10\\u201314; Just. & Free-\\ndom Fund Br. 9, 15\\u201316 & n.4. It creates incentives for officials to run out the clock on many claims, e.g., \\ndelaying until students gr aduate, or prisoners get \\ntransferred. Islam & Religious Freedom Br. 14\\u201315; Inst. for Free Speech Br. 14\\u20131 5; Becket Fund Br. 23\\u2013\\n25; Christian Legal Soc'y Br. 15\\u201317; FIRE Br. 5\\u20137. \\nIn short, the officials' mootness-related policy \\nconcerns do not justify their invitation to jettison the \\nmajority rule and create a nominal-damages excep-\\ntion to Article III. \\nC. The majority rule neither wastes judicial \\nresources nor prolongs cases.  \\nThe officials and their amici say that the enduring \\nmajority rule wastes judicial resources, prolongs \\nlawsuits, and increases attorney fees. Resp.Br.45; \\nD.C.Br. 13\\u201321. But government officials who quickly and \\\"reasonably respond\\\" when initially alerted to an unconstitutional policy, D.C.Br. 4\\u201311, rarely face protracted litigation. \\nConsider what happened here. Three years before \\nChike tried to speak on campus\\u2014in 2013 \\u2014counsel \\ninformed Georgia Gwinnett officials that their poli-cies were unconstitutional. Pet.App.89a\\u201390a. The of-ficials did nothing. Chike questioned the overbreadth and inconsistency of the officia ls' policies when he was \\nordered to stop speaking in 2016. Id. at 100a\\u201302a. \\nAgain, officials did nothing. When Chike filed suit in \\n18 \\nDecember 2016, the officials did not recant; they dou-\\nbled down, insisting that sharing the Christian faith \\n\\\"arguably rose to the level of 'fighting words'\\\" that the \\nFirst Amendment does not protect. Id. at 155a. \\nIt was not until much later in the case that the \\nofficials changed their unconstitutional policies and then promptly moved to dismiss. Id. at 160a. Imagine \\nhow much litigation and how many constitutional \\ndeprivations the officials could have avoided simply \\nby \\\"reasonably responding\\\" in 2013. \\nThe reality is officials oft en stubbornly refuse to \\nconcede that they have vi olated someone's constitu-\\ntional rights. E.g., N.Y. State Rifle & Pistol Ass'n , 140 \\nS. Ct. at 1538\\u201339 (Alito, J., dissenting) (city fought the \\nplaintiffs' Second Amendment rights \\\"tooth and nail\\\" \\nin lower courts, then strategically changed policy to \\n\\\"moot\\\" the case on the eve of oral argument in this Court). The amici briefs are replete with such examples. E.g., Becket Fund Br. 3 (prison changed \\npolicy \\\"[t]wo weeks before oral argument\\\"); \\nCatholicVote.org Br. 12 n.4 (city repealed ordinance \\n\\\"years into litigation\\\" an d \\\"days\\\" after grant of en \\nbanc review); Pacific Legal Found. Br. 1\\u20132 (city repealed ban \\\"[o]n the eve of oral argument\\\"); FIRE Br. 7 (universities \\\"disavow[  ]\\\" policies \\\"after the \\nstart of litigation\\\"). And though the District of \\nColumbia amici say the Eleventh Circuit's rule \\n\\\"incentivizes government actors to revisit challenged laws,\\\" the brief's listed examples all come from outside the Eleventh Circuit. D.C.Br. 4\\u201311. Indeed, the officials here changed their policies several months before  the Eleventh Circuit adopted its outlier \\nrule, further proving that the majority rule already \\nencourages officials to do the right thing. \\n19 \\nConversely, the longstanding rule does not \\nencourage plaintiffs to pursue pointless litigation \\nsimply to inflict an attorn ey-fee award. This \\\"Court's \\ndecision not to grant fees in Farrar was born of its \\nreluctance to reward attorneys for bringing less than \\nmeritorious claims that see k, but fail to obtain, large \\nmonetary judgments or fail to promote a larger public good.\\\" Project Vote/Voting for Am., Inc.  v. Dickerson , \\n444 F. App'x 660, 664 (4th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) \\n(citing Farrar , 506 U.S. at 116). The same will be true \\nin cases brought simply to harass. But a meritorious \\ncivil-rights claim brought to stop unconstitutional government conduct \\\"is the very form of litigation Congress wished to encourage by enacting \\u00a7  1988.\\\" \\nIbid.  (citing Daly v. Hill, 790 F.2d 1071, 1084 (4th Cir. \\n1986)). Accord, e.g., Fox v. Vice, 563 U.S. 826, 832\\u201333 \\n(2011) (characterizing a successful \\u00a7 1983 plaintiff pursuing \\u00a7 1988 fees as \\\"a private attorney general\\\") (citation omitted). \\\"Deterring meritorious lawsuits on constitutional issues because they offer a small \\nlikelihood of a significant money judgment presents \\nas grave a danger to our legal system as frivolous litigation.\\\" Project Vote , F. App'x at 664\\u201365 (quoting \\nKoopman v. Water Dist. No. 1 of Johnson Cnty. , 41 \\nF.3d 1417, 1421 (10th Cir. 1994)). Accord Rutherford Inst. Br. 7\\u201312 (discussing implications of tactical \\nmooting).  \\nIt's not even clear that following the majority rule \\nwould appreciably increase caseloads. The officials \\nhave provided no evidence that the circuits applying \\nthe majority rule have been overwhelmed with nominal-damages cases. Contra Inst. for Free Speech \\nBr. 16\\u201317 n.11 (statistics showing the opposite). In \\nthe long run, reaching the merits conserves judicial \\n20 \\nresources by produc ing precedent that obviates future \\ndisputes\\u2014sometimes on precisely the same issue,  \\nwhere unconstitutional policies are reinstated after a \\ncase has been strategically mooted. Id. at 17; The \\nPoint Isn't Moot , 129 Y ALE L.J.  FORUM  at 338\\u201341. \\nFinally, the most effective way to minimize \\nconstitutional violations is to hold recalcitrant officials accountable, not to deny victims the remedy \\nArticle III allows. Just. & Freedom Fund Br. 17\\u201318; \\ncontra Br. of Nat'l Conf. of State Legislatures 23\\u201324. When, as here, a prospective plaintiff sends government officials a warning letter, alerting them to unconstitutional conduct, the potential negative consequences of a future judgment, see Br. of Nat'l \\nConf. of State Legislatures 23\\u201324, are precisely what \\nmotivate the officials to change course. Officials who \\nknow they can violate constitutional rights without cost have no incentive to stop violating the Constitution. \\nIn sum, allowing the gove rnment to unilaterally \\nmoot claims for past consti tutional violations would \\nundermine the vindication of constitutional rights \\nand the Constitution itself. After all, courts are the \\\"department of the government to whom the protection of the rights of the individual is by the \\nconstitution especially confided.\\\" 1\\n ST. GEORGE \\nTUCKER , BLACKSTONE 'S COMMENTARIES , App. 357 \\n(1803). Prohibiting the government from doing so would not change the prevailing legal landscape. \\n  \\n21 \\nIII. The officials' rule would leave plaintiffs \\nwithout a remedy and result in more violations of constitutional rights.  \\nAbandoning the majority rule would leave some \\nvictims of constitutional violations without a remedy. \\nEquitable relief is often unavailable or easily mooted \\n(as shown here), and constitutional violations often do not cause quantifiable harm. Pet.Br.37; FIRE Br. 5\\u20139. The officials fail to meaningfully engage these points. \\nThe officials first insist that these claims \\\"can \\noften be adjudicated\\\" via \\\"prospective relief.\\\" \\nResp.Br.46. But \\\"can often\\\" means \\\"not always,\\\" since such relief is available only when the illegal conduct \\\"might happen again.\\\" Ibid. Those mistreated under \\na later-repealed policy or  subjected to \\\"one-off\\\" \\nviolations have no such reme dy. This gives officials at \\nleast one \\\"free pass\\\" to violate the Constitution.   \\nSuch a rule also artificia lly constricts the judici-\\nary's ability and duty to protect individual rights \\nbased on an unsupported as surance that officials will \\nuse this leeway altruistic ally and correct mistakes \\nquickly. Perhaps the offic ials' suggested approach \\nwould work if we were governed by angels rather than \\nmere \\\"men.\\\" T\\nHE FEDERALIST NO. 51, at 322 (James \\nMadison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961). But amici \\nrecount myriad experiences demonstrating that the judiciary serves as an important check-and-balance. \\nWorse, civil-rights litigants already face daunting \\nterrain:  persuading attorn eys to pro bono represent \\nthem, exhausting administrative remedies, and surviving immunity, which shields all but those who \\ndefy clearly established law. And at least six circuits \\n22 \\nhave even lowered the burden on officials to show a \\ncase is moot. The Point Isn't Moot , 129 Y ALE L.J.  \\nFORUM  at 333, n.50. The Eleventh Circuit, like others, \\ngives government officials \\\"considerably more leeway \\nthan private parties in the presumption that they are \\nunlikely to resume illegal activities.\\\" Coral Springs \\nSt. Sys., Inc.  v. City of Sunrise , 371 F.3d 1320, 1328\\u2013\\n29 (11th Cir. 2004). \\nThis flipped burden forces plaintiffs to prove\\u2014\\nusually with no discovery\\u2014that officials will revert to \\nthe original policy. Yet officials are \\\"more likely to strategically moot cases, not less\\\" than private defendants. The Point Isn't Moot , 129 Y\\nALE L.J.  \\nFORUM  at 335. Accord Becket Fund Br. 8\\u201314; FIRE \\nBr. 24\\u201328; CAIR Br. 15\\u201317. \\nFor \\\"one-off\\\" violations, the officials insist the \\nremedy is compensation. Resp.Br.49\\u201352. But again, this helps only those who ha ve suffered quantifiable \\nharm. And examples abound of constitutional injuries \\nthat often are not compens able, including unlawful \\nentry of private residences, denial of kosher meals in \\nprison, zoning restrictions on religious institutions, door-to-door proselytizin g restrictions, and free \\nspeech claims on campus\\u2014all examples that would transform difficulty pr oving damages into a \\njurisdictional bar. Hudson  v. Michigan , 547 U.S. 586, \\n610 (2006) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (\\\"the majority, like \\nMichigan and the United States, has failed to cite a single reported case in which a plaintiff has collected more than nominal damages solely as a result of a knock-and-announce violation\\\"); Just. & Freedom Fund Br. 5 n.2; CatholicVote .org Br. 16; ACLU Br. \\n17\\u201318; Islam & Religious Freedom Br. 8\\u20139; Becket \\nFund Br. 20\\u201325; Seventh- Day Adventists Br. 20. \\n23 \\nPlus, some religiously motivated plaintiffs only \\nwant justice or are reluctant to seek money damages \\nfor theological reasons. It's a perverse incentive to \\nforce  such plaintiffs to demand compensatory \\ndamages they do not want or need. \\nNor are compensatory damages for intangible \\ninjuries a cure-all. Many circuits require plaintiffs to prove those injuries without relying on their \\nsubjective testimony, and statutes and immunities \\nimpose more hurdles. Becket Fund Br. 15\\u201318. In these and other civil rights ca ses, plaintiffs steer clear \\nof compensatory damages because \\\"causation and quantification of damages are burdensome to litigate,\\\" \\\"there is little prospect of substantial \\nrecovery,\\\" and these clai ms \\\"profoundly irritate[  ] the \\njudge.\\\" Douglas Laycock, The Triumph of Equity , 56 \\nL.\\n & CONTEMP . PROBS . 53, 63 (1993). Discarding the \\nmajority rule on nominal damages leaves no remedy for those plaintiffs who do not have monetizable harm, rendering their rights unenforceable and \\neffectively nonexistent. \\nIf the Court creates an artificial jurisdictional bar \\nthat renders rights unenforceable in certain circum-stances, it is not difficult to predict that more viola-\\ntions of constitutional rights will follow. As this Court \\nhas already recognized, nominal-damages awards \\nensure that constitutional  rights are \\\"scrupulously \\nobserved.\\\" Carey , 435 U.S. at 266. Excluding such \\nawards from Article III would guarantee the opposite outcome. Although this problem extends to many backdrops, the context presented here\\u2014free speech on public college and university campuses\\u2014provides \\na stark illustration. \\n24 \\nNearly 90% of public, postsecondary institutions \\nmaintain policies that severely restrict protected \\nspeech or could be applied to do so. FIRE Br. 14\\u201323. \\nMany of these policies ar e vague and overbroad, \\nincluding granting officials unfettered discretion to \\nsilence and punish, or prohibiting offensive expres-\\nsion based on third-party perceptions ( i.e., heckler \\nvetoes). \\nGiven that evidence, there is a real risk that a \\nnew rule disallowing standalone nominal-damages claims would lead university officials to strategically moot controversies after  a student's rights are \\nviolated. Doubling down on constitutional depriva-tions would inevitably extend off campus to other \\ngovernment officials, endangering not just free speech \\nand religious exercise, but also Second Amendment \\nrights, the right to be free from illegal searches, unlawful detentions, and many others. \\nA constitutional right that cannot be enforced is \\nno right at all. This Court should say so and reverse.  \\n \\n25 \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_content_alt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3737,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"....................................................... 25  \\n \\n  \\niii \\nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES  \\nCases  \\nAetna Life Insurance Company of Hartford v. \\nHaworth ,  \\n300 U.S. 227 (1937) ............................................. 15 \\nAmato v.

No principle compels \\nsuch an anomalous result, and this Court should not \\ncreate an Article III except ion that excludes nominal-\\ndamages awards from ordinary justiciability rules. \\nThe officials do not contest that their actions \\ncaused Chike and Joseph real injury. Their argument is that nominal damages do not redress past injuries. \\nBut nominal damages vindic ate constitutional viola-\\ntions, including where the harm is not quantifiable. \\nMemphis Cmty. Sch. Dist. v. Stachura , 477 U.S. 299, \\n308 n.11 (1986) (quoting Carey v. Piphus , 435 U.S. \\n247, 266 (1978)). And contrary to the Eleventh Circuit's belief, they do so \\\"for the plaintiff's benefit.\\\" \\nFarrar v. Hobby , 506 U.S. 103, 113 (1992). Those \\nprinciples, common-law history, and common sense all show that a nominal-damages award provides a \\npersonal, tangible benefit that redresses a plaintiff's \\ninjury. Article III requires nothing more. \\nProviding a remedy to plaintiffs like Chike and \\nJoseph has neither flooded the courts with lawsuits \\nnor bankrupted officials in the many circuits that \\nallow standalone nominal-damages awards. Nominal \\ndamages, like compensato ry damages, have \\\"coex-\\nisted with our constitutional system since the dawn of the Republic.\\\" Tanzin v. Tanvir , __ S. Ct. __, 2020 WL \\n7250100, at 5 (Dec. 10, 2020). And a nation of laws \\nrequires  a way for courts to make things right when \\nofficials violate rights. Because nominal-damages claims satisfy Arti cle III, this Court should reverse. \\n2 \\nREPLY ARGUMENT  \\nI. T h i s  C o u r t  s h o u l d  d e c l i n e  t o  c r e a t e  a n  \\nArticle III exception that excludes nominal-\\ndamages awards from ordinary justicia-\\nbility rules. \\nThe officials do not deny that Chike and Joseph \\nsuffered a concrete injury-in-fact, nor do they deny \\ncausation. Their only objection is redressability. In making that objection, they confuse redressability \\nwith quantifiability . Because nominal damages \\nvindicate past legal violations, Chike and Joseph's nominal-damages claims s atisfy Article III and are \\nnot moot. \\nA. Nominal damages redress past constitu-\\ntional injury. \\nArticle III standing requires  a plaintiff to show he \\nhas suffered (1) a concrete and particularized injury-\\nin-fact, (2) caused by the defendant, (3) that is likely \\nto be redressed by a favorable court ruling. Spokeo, \\nInc. v. Robins , 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016). The \\nofficials do not dispute injury or causation. And \\nredressability requires only that a plaintiff personally \\n\\\"benefit in a tangible way from\\\" court intervention. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't , 523 U.S. 83, \\n103 n.5 (1998) (quotation omitted). A plaintiff \\nsatisfies that test by showing that a court order would \\n\\\"partially redress\\\" his injury. Meese v. Keene , 481 U.S. \\n465, 476 (1987). Nominal-damages awards, though \\nsmall, satisfy that standard.\\n1 \\n \\n1 The officials articulate a second redressability requirement: \\nthat the relief \\\"target and redress the plaintiff's asserted injury\\\" \\nrather than someone else's. Resp.Br.12. But that is no different \\nthan requiring that the remedy \\\"personally\\\" benefit the plaintiff. \\n3 \\nThe officials confuse redressability with quanti-\\nfiability. Consider a studen t who shared her faith on \\ncampus by chalking messages about Jesus Christ on \\nthe sidewalk, only to see a professor direct his class to erase them.\\n2 Even if the officials modified their \\npolicies to prevent this First Amendment violation \\nfrom happening again, the officials admit that this student could litigate to final judgment her 1\\u00a2 \\ncompensatory-damages claim for the consumed chalk. \\nEven a single penny of relief partially benefits the stu-dent personally and in a tangible way. \\nNow consider Chike. The officials do not dispute \\nhe was injured when they twice stopped him from speaking. The problem is that he cannot monetize the \\nlost speech's value. But Chike's lost speech is far more \\nvaluable than the consumed chalk. And it is the lost \\nspeech that gives Chike the right to seek judicial \\nredress; the $1 in nominal damages that officials \\nmust pay Chike is no less a partial redress that personally and tangibly benefits him than is the \\npenny that redresses the chalk user. A nominal-\\ndamages award \\\"modifies th e defendant's behavior \\nfor the plaintiff's benefit by forcing the defendant to \\npay an amount of money he otherwise would not pay.\\\" \\nFarrar , 506 U.S. at 113. And in this way, the payment \\nof nominal damages \\\"materially alters\\\" the parties' \\nlegal relationship, id. at 111\\u201312, in the same way as \\na modest compensatory-damages award. \\n \\n \\n2 Compare with Fresno State Students for Life  v. Thatcher , No. \\n1:17-at-00382 (E.D. Cal.), available at https://perma.cc/566E-\\n6EBZ. . \\n4 \\nThe officials say that whil e one dollar in compen-\\nsatory damages redresses a past injury, one dollar in \\nnominal damages does not. Resp.Br.17\\u201319. Again, \\nthis is confusion over quantifiability. Contra City of \\nRiverside v. Rivera , 477 U.S. 561, 574 (1986) \\n(plaintiff's vindication of \\\"important civil and \\nconstitutional rights that cannot be valued solely in monetary terms\\\"). Courts  award nominal damages \\nprimarily when there has been an \\\"infraction of a \\nlegal right\\\" but the \\\"extent of loss is not shown.\\\" C\\nHARLES T. MCCORMICK , HANDBOOK ON THE LAW OF \\nDAMAGES  \\u00a7 20 at 85 (1935). So it's not that nominal \\ndamages offer \\\" zero legally recognized relief for a past \\ninjury,\\\" Resp.Br.19 (emphasis added), it's that they \\noffer partial relief. Skyline Wesleyan Church v. Cal. \\nDep't of Managed Health Care , 968 F.3d 738, 749 (9th \\nCir. 2020) (\\\"Nominal damages would redress \\nSkyline's injury, even if only to a minimal extent.\\\"). \\nAnd because nominal dama ges \\\"materially alter[  ]\\\" \\nthe parties' relationship, Farrar , 506 U.S. at 111\\u201312, \\nthat is sufficient for Article III. Meese , 481 U.S. at 476. \\n\\\"Nothing more is needed to establish redressability.\\\" Skyline , 968 F.3d at 749. Otherwise, justiciability of \\nidentical claims turns on mere semantics. ACLU Br. \\n11\\u201312 (discussing Freenor v. Mayor & Alderman of \\nSavannah , No. CV414-247, 2019 WL 9936663 (S.D. \\nGa. May 20, 2019)). \\nAs this Court intimated in Carey , nominal dam-\\nages make a constitutional deprivation \\\"actionable.\\\" \\n435 U.S. at 266. That is because they redress a plain-\\ntiff's concrete and particula rized injury in a personal, \\ntangible way. U.S.Br.17\\u201319 (same result if Congress \\nauthorized a minimum $1,000 award for First \\nAmendment violations). A nominal-damages award partially redresses a loss of incalculable value. \\n5 \\nB. This Court's decisions confirm that \\nnominal damages' primary purpose is \\npast redress of valuable\\u2014even \\npriceless\\u2014rights. \\nNominal damages\\u2014like other remedies\\u2014have \\nmultiple effects that can include the declaration of \\nrights or the protection of prospective rights. But this \\nCourt's precedents and numerous lower-court \\ndecisions show that nominal damages' primary \\npurpose is to redress past legal violations. \\nCarey  decided that nominal damages, rather than \\npresumed damages, were the appropriate award for \\nconstitutional violations where harm cannot be mon-etized. 435 U.S. at 266. But the context was not \\\"pro-\\nspective redress.\\\" Contra Resp.Br.24. It was about \\nremedying a past \\\"deprivation\\\" of rights. 435 U.S. at \\n266. That is why the Court did not speak in terms of \\nany \\\"prospective\\\" due-process problem but to the past \\n\\\"denial of procedur al due process.\\\" Ibid. Accord, e.g., \\nStachura , 477 U.S. at 308 & n.11 (same point in free-\\nspeech context); Arizonans for Official English v. \\nArizona , 520 U.S. 43, 69 & n.24 (1997) (contrasting \\nnominal damages and injunctive relief). \\nLikewise, in Farrar , the plaintiff dropped a claim \\nfor injunctive relief and pursued only an unsuccessful compensatory-damages claim.  506 U.S. at 106. In \\ndetermining that a nominal-damages award made the \\nplaintiff a prevailing party under \\u00a7  1983, this Court \\nemphasized that \\\" Carey  obligates a court to award \\nnominal damages when a plaintiff establishes the \\nviolation of his [constitutional] right.\\\" Id. at 112. That \\nis, this Court correctly saw the award of nominal \\ndamages as retrospective redress, not prospective \\nprotection. \\n6 \\nUnsurprisingly, lower courts have consistently \\nrelied on this Court's cases to hold that a plaintiff \\nwhose constitutional rights have been violated \\n\\\"should not lose his right to proceed\\\" if \\\"only nominal damages are at stake.\\\" Amato v. City of Saratoga \\nSprings , 170 F.3d 311, 319 (2d Cir. 1999) (discussing \\nCarey ). Petitioners' opening brief discussed many \\nsuch cases. Pet.Br.27\\u201328. Yet the officials fail to \\nrespond to many. There are more examples, in count-\\nless settings. E.g., ACLU Br. 13\\u201319; Found. for \\nIndividual Rights in Educ. [FIRE] Br. 5\\u20139; Becket Fund Br. 20\\u201325; Pacific Legal Found. Br. 1\\u20134, 12\\u201316.  \\nThe officials' rule also vi olates this Court's prece-\\ndent in analogous contexts. For example, the officials \\ninsist that statutory damages are \\\"different in kind\\\" \\nbecause they \\\"do not signify nothing .\\\" Resp.Br.19\\u201320. \\nBut statutory and nominal damages serve the same \\npurpose: providing \\\"recompense for injury\\\" where \\n\\\"the rules of law render diff icult or impossible proof of \\ndamages.\\\" Douglas v. Cunningham , 294 U.S. 207, 209 \\n(1935). The officials concede that it \\\"is good enough \\nfor Article III\\\" when Congre ss sets statutory damages \\nwhere it \\\"might be hard to measure\\\" actual damages. \\nResp.Br.19\\u201320. It is no different when courts award \\nnominal damages for the same reason. \\nThe same is true of liquidated damages, which \\nassign a fixed value to harm where actual damages \\n\\\"may be difficult or impossible to ascertain.\\\" Rex \\nTrailer Co. v. United States , 350 U.S. 148, 153\\u201354 \\n(1956). And punitive dama ges are non-compensatory \\nand sometimes awarded without compensatory harm. U.S.Br.19\\u201320. Yet the offici als do not dispute that a \\nplaintiff with a standalone claim for statutory, \\nliquidated, or punitive da mages has failed to present \\nan Article III case or controversy. \\n7 \\nThe officials criticize Chike and Joseph for \\nequating \\\"vindication\\\" of rights with Article III \\nredress. Resp.Br.21\\u201323. But where \\\"there has been a \\nviolation of a right, the person injured is entitled to an action. If he is entitled to an action, he is entitled \\nat least to nominal damages,  or else he would not be \\nentitled to a recovery.\\\" Parker v. Griswold , 17 Conn. \\n288, 303 (1846). \\nC. At common law, courts routinely award-\\ned standalone nominal damages solely to redress past injuries. \\nNo one disputes that English and American \\ncommon-law courts consistently adjudicated claims for nominal damages in a wide array of cases, and \\nthat such claims arose from a past violation of rights. \\nYet the officials insist that when common-law courts \\ndid award nominal damages, it was only for \\ncontinuing or threatened injuries. Resp.Br.28\\u201340. \\nCenturies of cases debunk this theory. \\nFor one thing, the officials concede that entire cat-\\negories of common-law cases involved the award of \\nnominal damages even \\\"whe n they would not plainly \\nserve as prospective relief.\\\" Id. at 34. These include \\ncases (like this one) when the plaintiff \\\"proved a legal \\nviolation\\\" but failed to establish or quantify compensatory damages, ibid. , \\\"as a vehicle for costs,\\\" \\nid. at 32\\u201334, or for \\\"dignitary harms,\\\" id. at 38. And \\nthese categories of cases\\u2014which alone undermine the officials' historical analysis\\u2014are just a few examples. \\nEnglish courts inferred nominal damages when-\\never the plaintiff establish ed an invasion of a legal \\nright, no matter if ther e was a continuing or \\nthreatened injury. \\\"[I]njury imports a damage, \\nthough it does not cost the party one farthing.\\\" Ashby  \\n8 \\nv. White , 92 Eng. Rep. 126, 137 (1703) (Holt, J.). \\nCourts \\\"import[ed] a dama ge\\\" for various claims, \\nincluding breach of contract, trespass, and personal \\ninjury. Ibid.  (\\\"a cuff on the ear\\\" would be actionable \\n\\\"for it is a personal injury\\\").  \\nFor personal rights, nominal damages served to \\nremedy past harms, not to  protect against future \\ninjury. In Ashby , for example, the House of Lords held \\nthat an elector who was wrongfully turned away from \\nthe polls by an official could sue without proving the \\\"possibility of a future profi t\\\" or the \\\"possibility of a \\nfuture\\\" damage. 87 Eng. Rep. 810, 810, 813 (1703) \\n(Powell, J., & Gould, J.). Often these violations occurred when an official fa iled to perform his duty \\nbut cured the defect before suit. In these cases, plain-\\ntiffs could still recover nominal damages for the past \\ninjury even though they had no need for prospective \\nrelief. E.g., Barker v. Green , 130 Eng. Rep. 327, 327 \\n(1824) (sheriff's one-day delay in arrest on writ); Bales \\nv. Wingfield , 4 Q.B. 580, n. (multi-week delay by \\nsheriff in executing a lien writ); Clifton  v. Hooper , 115 \\nEng. Rep. 175, 175, 178 (1844) (sheriff delay in exe-cuting process). This was al so true for actions brought \\nagainst private citizens. E.g., Marzetti v. Williams , \\n109 Eng. Rep. 842, 845\\u201347 (1830) (one-day delay in issuing check); Godefroy  v. Jay, 131 Eng. Rep. 159, \\n159\\u201362 (1831) (client could receive nominal damages \\nfor attorney's negligence). \\nAmerican courts followed suit. Plaintiffs could \\nrecover at least nominal damages for injuries caused \\nby public officials without showing the threat of future harm. E.g.,  Mickles v. Hart , 1 Denio 548, 550 \\n(N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1845) (sheriff deputy's delay in \\nexecuting debt); Laflin v. Willard , 33 Mass. 64, 67 \\n(1835) (same); Waterhouse v. Waite , 11 Mass. 207, 210 \\n9 \\n(1814) (same); Burns v. Erben , 26 How. Pr. 273, 277 \\n(N.Y. Super. Ct. 1864) (false imprisonment); Doherty  \\nv. Munson , 127 Mass. 495, 496 (1879) (detention \\nunder illegal warrant). And American courts routinely awarded nominal damages in private \\nactions when such an award could provide no \\nprospective relief. E.g., Thompson  v. New Orleans, J. \\n& G.N.R. Co. , 50 Miss. 315, 320 (1874) (train \\nconductor passed passenger's stop by two miles); \\nCrosby v. Humphreys , 60 N.W. 843, 844 (Minn. 1894) \\n(assault); Young v. W. Union Tel. Co. , 11 S.E. 1044, \\n1044\\u201345 (N.C. 1890) (negligent delay in delivering \\ntelegraph); McKim  v. Bartlett , 129 Mass. 226, 229 \\n(1880) (estate administrator liable for at least nomi-nal damages after court discharged future liability).  \\nThis partial list shows that early American \\ncourts\\u2014like their English counterparts\\u2014undeniably \\nawarded nominal damages so lely for past injuries. \\nAccord, e.g., U.S.Br.10\\u201311; Nat'l Right to Work Legal \\nDef. Found. Br. 4\\u201310. \\nEven a nominal-damages award in a trespass, \\nriparian-rights, or other pr operty case was intended, \\nfirst and foremost, to vindicate the past \\\"violation of \\nthe plaintiff's right.\\\" Delaware & Hudson Canal Co.  \\nv. Torrey , 33 Pa. 143, 148 (1859); accord Embrey v. \\nOwen , 155 Eng. Rep. 579, 585 (1851) (same). And that \\nis why common-law courts awarded nominal damages \\nin property cases even when the parties' future rights \\nand obligations were not at stake. E.g., Hefley  v. \\nBaker , 19 Kan. 9, 11 (1877) (pure trespass case with \\nno property-line dispute); Curtis v. Paggett , 27 P. 109, \\n109\\u201310 (Kan. 1891) (same); Cook v. Loomis , 26 Conn. \\n483, 486 (1857) (trover case where property already \\nreturned); Mears v. Cornwall , 40 N.W. 931, 932\\u201334 \\n(Mich. 1888) (same); Warder v. Baldwin , 8 N.W. 257, \\n10 \\n258 (Wis. 1881) (same); Moon v. Raphael , 132 Eng. \\nRep. 122, 122 (1835) (same). And plaintiffs at common \\nlaw could waive their right to compensatory damages \\nand choose to seek nominal damages alone. Pet.Br.42; \\naccord Daniels v. Bates , 2 Greene 151, 152 (Iowa \\n1849); Pastorius v. Fisher , 1 Rawle 27, 29 (Pa. 1828). \\nThe officials' failure to address so many of these \\ncases is no mere oversight. Many are on all fours with \\nthe constitutional violations at issue here and \\nestablish the common-law ru le that nominal damages \\nsupport a claim for past constitutional violations. So \\ndo cases involving intentional torts. Frederick \\nDouglass Found. Br. 6\\u20138 (c omparing Petitioners' \\ninjuries to those caused by intentional torts, for which \\ncourts awarded nominal damages); Stachura , 477 \\nU.S. at 306 (level of \\u00a7  1983 damages \\\"determined \\naccording to principles de rived from the common law \\nof torts\\\"). \\nThe officials say that, even if common-law courts \\nawarded nominal damages with no \\\"prospective \\nremedial benefits,\\\" such awards were meaningless \\nand insufficient \\\"for maintaining an action.\\\" Resp.Br.35\\u201336. But as detailed above, countless cases \\nheld that a standalone nominal-damages claim \\nsustained a case having no effect on future rights. It would be passing strange for so many courts, over so \\nmany years, to adjudicate  nominal-damages claims \\nthat they thought served no purpose and, in the officials' view, violated redressability requirements. \\nFinally, while early common-law courts may have \\nbeen unwilling to reverse a trial court's failure to award nominal damages in trifling or frivolous cases, \\nResp.Br.34\\u201335; Fleming  v. Gilbert , 3 Johns 528, 532 \\n(N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1808); Robertson v. Gentry , 5 Ky. 542, \\n11 \\n543 (Ct. App. 1812), that reluctance faded when \\n\\\"important\\\" rights were at stake. Blackburn v. Ala. \\nGreat S. R. Co. , 39 So. 345, 346 (Ala. 1905); Hecht  v. \\nHarrison , 40 P. 306, 309\\u201310 (Wyo. 1895). Modern \\ncourts view nominal damages the same way when a \\nplaintiff alleges a constitutional violation. E.g., Risdal \\nv. Halford , 209 F.3d 1071, 1073 (8th Cir. 2000) \\n(reversing for plain error because the district court \\nfailed to instruct the jury  to award nominal damages \\nif it found a free-speech violation); Zok v. State , 903 \\nP.2d 574, 579 (Alaska 1995) (failure to award nominal \\ndamages for unlawful arrest was plain error because \\nthe \\\"right to be free from unlawful confinement is sufficiently important and fundamental in our \\nsociety\\\"). Indeed, circuit co urts uniformly hold that an \\naward of nominal damages is mandatory upon \\nproving a constitutional violation. Pet.Br.30\\u201331 n.4 \\n(collecting cases). The officials' cramped theory of \\nnominal damages cannot explain away this history. \\nD. Nominal damages are not a mere \\nanalogue for declaratory relief. \\nNominal damages' primary purpose is to redress \\na past injury. Yet the officials continue to assert that \\n\\\"[d]eclaratory judgments are the analogue,\\\" \\nResp.Br.41, unless sovereign or qualified immunity is at stake, in which case th e officials feel differently, id. \\nat 42 n.3. The officials are incorrect. U.S.Br.23\\u201327. \\nTo be sure, \\\"all judgments of courts declare jural \\nrelations.\\\" Edwin M. Borchard, The Declaratory \\nJudgment\\u2014A Needed Procedural Reform , 28 Y\\nALE \\nL.J. 1, 4 (1918). Yet courts do not equate all forms of \\nrelief with declaratory judgments just because they share this one trait. \\n12 \\nNor do the officials rebut the many other differ-\\nences between declaratory judgments and nominal \\ndamages that unravel their flawed analogy. First, \\nnominal damages are legal relief, while declaratory judgments are equitable. Resp.Br.42 n.3. Second, \\ndeclaratory judgments were designed to determine \\nlegal rights \\\" before breach .\\\" Edwin M. Borchard, The \\nUniform Act on Declaratory Judgments , 34 H\\nARV. L. \\nREV. 697, 707 (1921). Nominal damages remedy past \\nharm, unavailable until an injury has occurred. C\\nHARLES T. MCCORMICK , HANDBOOK ON THE LAW OF \\nDAMAGES  \\u00a7 20 at 85 (1935) (\\\"Nominal damages are \\nawarded for the infraction of a legal right.\\\"). \\nThird, declaratory judgments are primarily \\nprospective relief, Christian Legal Soc'y v. Martinez , \\n561 U.S. 661, 676 n.6 (2010), while nominal damages, \\nwhich require a past violation, are primarily retro-\\nspective, Arizonans for Official English , 520 U.S. at \\n69 & n.24.   Fourth, the Declaratory Judgment Act \\n\\\"confers a discretion  on the courts,\\\" not an \\\"absolute \\nright upon the litigant.\\\" Wilton v. Seven Falls Co. , 515 \\nU.S. 277, 287 (1995). Nominal damages are manda-tory. Farrar , 506 U.S. at 112 (\\\" Carey obligate[d] a \\ncourt to award nominal damages when a plaintiff \\nestablishes the violation of his right\\\"). And finally, \\nunlike declaratory judgments,  courts have held that \\nnominal damages are subject to sovereign- and \\nqualified-immunity defenses. E.g., Am. Civil Liberties \\nUnion v. U.S. Conf. of Cath. Bishops , 705 F.3d 44, 53 \\nn.7 (1st Cir. 2013) (sovereign immunity); Hopkins v. \\nSaunders , 199 F.3d 968, 978 (8th Cir. 1999) (qualified \\nimmunity). \\nIn sum, the disparities between declaratory judg-\\nments and nominal damages are stark. And rightly \\nso, as their primary purpose is decidedly different. \\n13 \\nE. The officials' view of nominal damages \\ncontradicts Article III requirements. \\nRationalizing some of the many instances in \\nwhich common-law courts awarded nominal damages \\nfor the past violation of rights, the officials argue that \\nthe \\\"jurisdictional hook\\\" is \\\"the plaintiff's live claim \\nfor compensatory damages.\\\" Resp.Br.26. This hook saves a nominal-damages claim from mootness, say \\nthe officials, even if the plaintiff's compensatory-\\ndamages claim fail s on the merits. Ibid.  That \\nreasoning cannot be right. \\nTo begin, \\\"a plaintiff must demonstrate standing \\nfor each claim he seeks to press and for each form of relief that is sought.\\\" Town of Chester v. Laroe Ests., \\nInc., 137 S. Ct. 1645, 1650 (2017) (citation omitted). It \\nis impossible for a compensatory-damage remedy to \\nbe a \\\"jurisdictional hook\\\" for a separate, moot remedy. \\nA nominal-damages remedy mu st (and does) stand on \\nits own merits from the case's inception. \\nIn addition, \\\"an actual controversy must be extant \\nat all stages of review, not merely at the time the com-\\nplaint is filed.\\\" Arizonans for Official English , 520 \\nU.S. at 67 (citation omitted). Once a plausible claim \\nfor compensatory damages fail s at the merits stage, it \\nis again impossible for that claim to be a \\\"jurisdictional hook\\\" for a separate, moot claim. \\nMoreover, a plaintiff must quantify injury to \\nclaim compensatory damage s. Yet the loss of First \\nAmendment freedoms like speech and religious \\nexercise constitutes \\\"irreparable injury.\\\" Roman \\nCatholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , __ S. Ct. __, \\n2020 WL 6948354, at 3 (Nov. 25, 2020). Such injury \\n\\\"cannot be adequately measured or compensated by \\nmoney.\\\" Irreparable Injury , B\\nLACK 'S LAW DICTIONARY  \\n14 \\n(11th ed. 2019). The officials' position would lead to \\nthe indefensible result that the appropriate remedy \\nfor a past violation of rights is one that in some cases \\nwill not be available. \\nFinally, the officials' position deprives some \\nvictims of government misconduct of any remedy. The \\nofficials say that without plausible compensatory-damages remedies, plaintiffs can still \\\"vindicate their \\nrights through claims for prospective relief like \\ninjunctions and declaratory judgments.\\\" Resp.Br.46\\u201348. But that only underscor es the correctness of Chike \\nand Joseph's position: that eliminating the nominal-\\ndamages remedy would allo w officials to make a \\nstrategic post-filing change in policy solely to moot \\nprospective relief. Such a risk is real because \\ngovernment officials have strong incentives to moot \\ncases. Becket Fund Br. 8\\u201314; Joseph C. Davis & \\nNicholas R. Reaves, The Point Isn't Moot: How Lower \\nCourts Have Blessed Go vernment Abuse of the \\nVoluntary-Cessation Doctrine , 129 Y\\nALE L.J.  FORUM  \\n325 (2019). The officials propose a phantom remedy to \\ninsulate their unconstitutional acts from legal accountability. \\n  \\n15 \\nII. The officials' reasons for creating a nominal-\\ndamages exception to Article III are indefensible. \\nThe officials predict dire  effects if this Court \\nallows partial redress for the violation of Chike and \\nJoseph's rights. Yet it ha s been \\\"widely recognized\\\" \\nfor ages \\\"that a claim for nominal damages precludes mootness\\\" based on later events. N.Y. State Rifle & \\nPistol Ass'n v. City of N.Y. , 140 S. Ct. 1525, 1536 \\n(2020) (Alito, J., dissenting); Pet.Br.14 n.2 (catalog-uing eight circuits' rule). None of these asserted \\nconsequences have material ized in the jurisdictions \\nthat have rejected the Eleventh Circuit's novel and indefensible approach. The officials' arguments lack \\nmerit. \\nA. The majority rule does not require \\nadvisory opinions. \\nThe officials say that nominal-damages claims \\ninvite advisory opinions. Resp.Br. 2, 9\\u201310, 22, 41\\u201342. Not so. To quote the officials' own cases, advisory opinions \\\"advis[e] what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\\\" Aetna Life Ins. Co. of \\nHartford v. Haworth , 300 U.S. 227, 241 (1937). \\nAccord, e.g., Preiser v. Newkirk , 422 U.S. 395, 401 \\n(1975) (same);  Ashcroft v. Mattis , 431 U.S. 171, 172 \\n(1977) (per curiam). That's not the request here. \\nChike and Joseph present real-world facts and \\n\\\"concrete legal issues, presented in [an] actual case[  ],\\\" \\nGolden v. Zwickler , 394 U.S. 103, 108 (1969): whether \\nofficials violated their free -speech rights. It is not \\nclear why the officials believe that question is more hypothetical here than if Chike's speech had con-sumed 1\\u00a2 of chalk, particularly when the officials do \\n16 \\nnot contest he suffered a cognizable injury-in-fact. \\nThere is nothing advisory about deciding the question \\nand awarding nominal damages. Young Ams. for \\nLiberty Br. 12; Christia n Legal Soc'y Br. 5\\u20136. \\nB. The majority rule does not eliminate the \\nmootness doctrine. \\nThe longstanding majority rule has not \\\"swal-\\nlowed\\\" the mootness doctrine in the eight circuits that \\nfollow it. Contra Resp.Br.43\\u201345. Many constitutional \\ncases seek only prospectiv e relief, either because \\ndamages are barred by sovereign immunity or because the injury is threatened or imminent but has not yet occurred at the time of filing. The mootness doctrine is alive and well for those cases. The \\nsituation here\\u2014where the officials already violated \\nChike's and Joseph's constitutional rights\\u2014presents \\nthe flip side of mootness: fed eral courts are obligated \\nto adjudicate live controversies. Knox v. Serv. Emps. \\nInt'l Union, Local 1000 , 567 U.S. 298, 307\\u201308 (2012). \\nPlus, the officials' concer n for the vitality of the \\nmootness doctrine is selective. They concede that the \\ndoctrine has not crumbled ev en though a plaintiff can \\navoid mootness by seeking compensation for negli-gible financial damages. Resp.Br.49. So, it will not disintegrate if a plaintiff seeks justice without putting \\nhimself and the courts through the trouble and \\ndisproportionate expense of monetizing, proving, and \\nassessing those injuries, as long experience in the courts of appeals attests. Ar ticle III does not require \\nplaintiffs to repackage no minal-damages claims as \\nsmall damages claims. Both types of claims ensure a \\nlive controversy. \\n17 \\nFar more troublesome problems arise under the \\nofficials' rule, which allows governments to moot \\ncases unilaterally and strategically. That approach \\nallows officials to reinstate unconstitutional policies, a phenomenon that the amici have well documented. \\nFIRE Br. 24\\u201327; Becket Fund Br. 10\\u201314; Just. & Free-\\ndom Fund Br. 9, 15\\u201316 & n.4. It creates incentives for officials to run out the clock on many claims, e.g., \\ndelaying until students gr aduate, or prisoners get \\ntransferred. Islam & Religious Freedom Br. 14\\u201315; Inst. for Free Speech Br. 14\\u20131 5; Becket Fund Br. 23\\u2013\\n25; Christian Legal Soc'y Br. 15\\u201317; FIRE Br. 5\\u20137. \\nIn short, the officials' mootness-related policy \\nconcerns do not justify their invitation to jettison the \\nmajority rule and create a nominal-damages excep-\\ntion to Article III. \\nC. The majority rule neither wastes judicial \\nresources nor prolongs cases.  \\nThe officials and their amici say that the enduring \\nmajority rule wastes judicial resources, prolongs \\nlawsuits, and increases attorney fees. Resp.Br.45; \\nD.C.Br. 13\\u201321. But government officials who quickly and \\\"reasonably respond\\\" when initially alerted to an unconstitutional policy, D.C.Br. 4\\u201311, rarely face protracted litigation. \\nConsider what happened here. Three years before \\nChike tried to speak on campus\\u2014in 2013 \\u2014counsel \\ninformed Georgia Gwinnett officials that their poli-cies were unconstitutional. Pet.App.89a\\u201390a. The of-ficials did nothing. Chike questioned the overbreadth and inconsistency of the officia ls' policies when he was \\nordered to stop speaking in 2016. Id. at 100a\\u201302a. \\nAgain, officials did nothing. When Chike filed suit in \\n18 \\nDecember 2016, the officials did not recant; they dou-\\nbled down, insisting that sharing the Christian faith \\n\\\"arguably rose to the level of 'fighting words'\\\" that the \\nFirst Amendment does not protect. Id. at 155a. \\nIt was not until much later in the case that the \\nofficials changed their unconstitutional policies and then promptly moved to dismiss. Id. at 160a. Imagine \\nhow much litigation and how many constitutional \\ndeprivations the officials could have avoided simply \\nby \\\"reasonably responding\\\" in 2013. \\nThe reality is officials oft en stubbornly refuse to \\nconcede that they have vi olated someone's constitu-\\ntional rights. E.g., N.Y. State Rifle & Pistol Ass'n , 140 \\nS. Ct. at 1538\\u201339 (Alito, J., dissenting) (city fought the \\nplaintiffs' Second Amendment rights \\\"tooth and nail\\\" \\nin lower courts, then strategically changed policy to \\n\\\"moot\\\" the case on the eve of oral argument in this Court). The amici briefs are replete with such examples. E.g., Becket Fund Br. 3 (prison changed \\npolicy \\\"[t]wo weeks before oral argument\\\"); \\nCatholicVote.org Br. 12 n.4 (city repealed ordinance \\n\\\"years into litigation\\\" an d \\\"days\\\" after grant of en \\nbanc review); Pacific Legal Found. Br. 1\\u20132 (city repealed ban \\\"[o]n the eve of oral argument\\\"); FIRE Br. 7 (universities \\\"disavow[  ]\\\" policies \\\"after the \\nstart of litigation\\\"). And though the District of \\nColumbia amici say the Eleventh Circuit's rule \\n\\\"incentivizes government actors to revisit challenged laws,\\\" the brief's listed examples all come from outside the Eleventh Circuit. D.C.Br. 4\\u201311. Indeed, the officials here changed their policies several months before  the Eleventh Circuit adopted its outlier \\nrule, further proving that the majority rule already \\nencourages officials to do the right thing. \\n19 \\nConversely, the longstanding rule does not \\nencourage plaintiffs to pursue pointless litigation \\nsimply to inflict an attorn ey-fee award. This \\\"Court's \\ndecision not to grant fees in Farrar was born of its \\nreluctance to reward attorneys for bringing less than \\nmeritorious claims that see k, but fail to obtain, large \\nmonetary judgments or fail to promote a larger public good.\\\" Project Vote/Voting for Am., Inc.  v. Dickerson , \\n444 F. App'x 660, 664 (4th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) \\n(citing Farrar , 506 U.S. at 116). The same will be true \\nin cases brought simply to harass. But a meritorious \\ncivil-rights claim brought to stop unconstitutional government conduct \\\"is the very form of litigation Congress wished to encourage by enacting \\u00a7  1988.\\\" \\nIbid.  (citing Daly v. Hill, 790 F.2d 1071, 1084 (4th Cir. \\n1986)). Accord, e.g., Fox v. Vice, 563 U.S. 826, 832\\u201333 \\n(2011) (characterizing a successful \\u00a7 1983 plaintiff pursuing \\u00a7 1988 fees as \\\"a private attorney general\\\") (citation omitted). \\\"Deterring meritorious lawsuits on constitutional issues because they offer a small \\nlikelihood of a significant money judgment presents \\nas grave a danger to our legal system as frivolous litigation.\\\" Project Vote , F. App'x at 664\\u201365 (quoting \\nKoopman v. Water Dist. No. 1 of Johnson Cnty. , 41 \\nF.3d 1417, 1421 (10th Cir. 1994)). Accord Rutherford Inst. Br. 7\\u201312 (discussing implications of tactical \\nmooting).  \\nIt's not even clear that following the majority rule \\nwould appreciably increase caseloads. The officials \\nhave provided no evidence that the circuits applying \\nthe majority rule have been overwhelmed with nominal-damages cases. Contra Inst. for Free Speech \\nBr. 16\\u201317 n.11 (statistics showing the opposite). In \\nthe long run, reaching the merits conserves judicial \\n20 \\nresources by produc ing precedent that obviates future \\ndisputes\\u2014sometimes on precisely the same issue,  \\nwhere unconstitutional policies are reinstated after a \\ncase has been strategically mooted. Id. at 17; The \\nPoint Isn't Moot , 129 Y ALE L.J.  FORUM  at 338\\u201341. \\nFinally, the most effective way to minimize \\nconstitutional violations is to hold recalcitrant officials accountable, not to deny victims the remedy \\nArticle III allows. Just. & Freedom Fund Br. 17\\u201318; \\ncontra Br. of Nat'l Conf. of State Legislatures 23\\u201324. When, as here, a prospective plaintiff sends government officials a warning letter, alerting them to unconstitutional conduct, the potential negative consequences of a future judgment, see Br. of Nat'l \\nConf. of State Legislatures 23\\u201324, are precisely what \\nmotivate the officials to change course. Officials who \\nknow they can violate constitutional rights without cost have no incentive to stop violating the Constitution. \\nIn sum, allowing the gove rnment to unilaterally \\nmoot claims for past consti tutional violations would \\nundermine the vindication of constitutional rights \\nand the Constitution itself. After all, courts are the \\\"department of the government to whom the protection of the rights of the individual is by the \\nconstitution especially confided.\\\" 1\\n ST. GEORGE \\nTUCKER , BLACKSTONE 'S COMMENTARIES , App. 357 \\n(1803). Prohibiting the government from doing so would not change the prevailing legal landscape. \\n  \\n21 \\nIII. The officials' rule would leave plaintiffs \\nwithout a remedy and result in more violations of constitutional rights.  \\nAbandoning the majority rule would leave some \\nvictims of constitutional violations without a remedy. \\nEquitable relief is often unavailable or easily mooted \\n(as shown here), and constitutional violations often do not cause quantifiable harm. Pet.Br.37; FIRE Br. 5\\u20139. The officials fail to meaningfully engage these points. \\nThe officials first insist that these claims \\\"can \\noften be adjudicated\\\" via \\\"prospective relief.\\\" \\nResp.Br.46. But \\\"can often\\\" means \\\"not always,\\\" since such relief is available only when the illegal conduct \\\"might happen again.\\\" Ibid. Those mistreated under \\na later-repealed policy or  subjected to \\\"one-off\\\" \\nviolations have no such reme dy. This gives officials at \\nleast one \\\"free pass\\\" to violate the Constitution.   \\nSuch a rule also artificia lly constricts the judici-\\nary's ability and duty to protect individual rights \\nbased on an unsupported as surance that officials will \\nuse this leeway altruistic ally and correct mistakes \\nquickly. Perhaps the offic ials' suggested approach \\nwould work if we were governed by angels rather than \\nmere \\\"men.\\\" T\\nHE FEDERALIST NO. 51, at 322 (James \\nMadison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961). But amici \\nrecount myriad experiences demonstrating that the judiciary serves as an important check-and-balance. \\nWorse, civil-rights litigants already face daunting \\nterrain:  persuading attorn eys to pro bono represent \\nthem, exhausting administrative remedies, and surviving immunity, which shields all but those who \\ndefy clearly established law. And at least six circuits \\n22 \\nhave even lowered the burden on officials to show a \\ncase is moot. The Point Isn't Moot , 129 Y ALE L.J.  \\nFORUM  at 333, n.50. The Eleventh Circuit, like others, \\ngives government officials \\\"considerably more leeway \\nthan private parties in the presumption that they are \\nunlikely to resume illegal activities.\\\" Coral Springs \\nSt. Sys., Inc.  v. City of Sunrise , 371 F.3d 1320, 1328\\u2013\\n29 (11th Cir. 2004). \\nThis flipped burden forces plaintiffs to prove\\u2014\\nusually with no discovery\\u2014that officials will revert to \\nthe original policy. Yet officials are \\\"more likely to strategically moot cases, not less\\\" than private defendants. The Point Isn't Moot , 129 Y\\nALE L.J.  \\nFORUM  at 335. Accord Becket Fund Br. 8\\u201314; FIRE \\nBr. 24\\u201328; CAIR Br. 15\\u201317. \\nFor \\\"one-off\\\" violations, the officials insist the \\nremedy is compensation. Resp.Br.49\\u201352. But again, this helps only those who ha ve suffered quantifiable \\nharm. And examples abound of constitutional injuries \\nthat often are not compens able, including unlawful \\nentry of private residences, denial of kosher meals in \\nprison, zoning restrictions on religious institutions, door-to-door proselytizin g restrictions, and free \\nspeech claims on campus\\u2014all examples that would transform difficulty pr oving damages into a \\njurisdictional bar. Hudson  v. Michigan , 547 U.S. 586, \\n610 (2006) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (\\\"the majority, like \\nMichigan and the United States, has failed to cite a single reported case in which a plaintiff has collected more than nominal damages solely as a result of a knock-and-announce violation\\\"); Just. & Freedom Fund Br. 5 n.2; CatholicVote .org Br. 16; ACLU Br. \\n17\\u201318; Islam & Religious Freedom Br. 8\\u20139; Becket \\nFund Br. 20\\u201325; Seventh- Day Adventists Br. 20. \\n23 \\nPlus, some religiously motivated plaintiffs only \\nwant justice or are reluctant to seek money damages \\nfor theological reasons. It's a perverse incentive to \\nforce  such plaintiffs to demand compensatory \\ndamages they do not want or need. \\nNor are compensatory damages for intangible \\ninjuries a cure-all. Many circuits require plaintiffs to prove those injuries without relying on their \\nsubjective testimony, and statutes and immunities \\nimpose more hurdles. Becket Fund Br. 15\\u201318. In these and other civil rights ca ses, plaintiffs steer clear \\nof compensatory damages because \\\"causation and quantification of damages are burdensome to litigate,\\\" \\\"there is little prospect of substantial \\nrecovery,\\\" and these clai ms \\\"profoundly irritate[  ] the \\njudge.\\\" Douglas Laycock, The Triumph of Equity , 56 \\nL.\\n & CONTEMP . PROBS . 53, 63 (1993). Discarding the \\nmajority rule on nominal damages leaves no remedy for those plaintiffs who do not have monetizable harm, rendering their rights unenforceable and \\neffectively nonexistent. \\nIf the Court creates an artificial jurisdictional bar \\nthat renders rights unenforceable in certain circum-stances, it is not difficult to predict that more viola-\\ntions of constitutional rights will follow. As this Court \\nhas already recognized, nominal-damages awards \\nensure that constitutional  rights are \\\"scrupulously \\nobserved.\\\" Carey , 435 U.S. at 266. Excluding such \\nawards from Article III would guarantee the opposite outcome. Although this problem extends to many backdrops, the context presented here\\u2014free speech on public college and university campuses\\u2014provides \\na stark illustration. \\n24 \\nNearly 90% of public, postsecondary institutions \\nmaintain policies that severely restrict protected \\nspeech or could be applied to do so. FIRE Br. 14\\u201323. \\nMany of these policies ar e vague and overbroad, \\nincluding granting officials unfettered discretion to \\nsilence and punish, or prohibiting offensive expres-\\nsion based on third-party perceptions ( i.e., heckler \\nvetoes). \\nGiven that evidence, there is a real risk that a \\nnew rule disallowing standalone nominal-damages claims would lead university officials to strategically moot controversies after  a student's rights are \\nviolated. Doubling down on constitutional depriva-tions would inevitably extend off campus to other \\ngovernment officials, endangering not just free speech \\nand religious exercise, but also Second Amendment \\nrights, the right to be free from illegal searches, unlawful detentions, and many others. \\nA constitutional right that cannot be enforced is \\nno right at all. This Court should say so and reverse.  \\n \\n25\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"cleaned_args\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sections_alt\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 354,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/16-1150.html\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"arg_structure\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Nearly all \\nSouthern colonies and states empowered slave patrols to act on their behalf for the purpose of apprehending \\nslaves.\\n10 Throughout the South, these entities exacted \\nunspeakable terror on African Americans as agents of the colonial or state governments. \\nSlave patrollers earned a reputation for brutality: \\nthey carried out their duties, armed with guns, whips, and hounds.\\n11 In the seminal work, Twelve Years a \\nSlave , Solomon Northup explained: \\n6 Sally E.

See \\nPet. Br. 23-24. If Congress did indeed intent to exclude \\nforeclosures from the Act, on e would expect to see some \\ncommentary, somewhere, to that  effect. And that is espe-\\ncially so where one of the enacted provisions (Section 1692i) directly targets forecl osure proceedings. Respond-\\nent has no explanation for why this particular dog did not bark. \\nSecond, respondent suggest s that the FDCPA was a \\nproduct of compromise that le ft security enforcers (how-\\n18 \\never they might otherwise qualify under the main defini-\\ntion) subject \\\"only\\\" to the \\\"limited\\\" focus of Section \\n1692f(6). Br. 25-26. The clear legislative compromise, \\nhowever, was not to exempt security enforces who are \\nalso debt collectors; it wa s to include those who only  en-\\nforce security interests but su bject them solely to one sub-\\nsection (not every subsection ) of the Act. That compro-\\nmise reflects the differences between the bills and (more importantly) reads the enacted  t e x t  t o  m e a n  w h a t  i t  s o  \\nplainly says. Respondent's co ntrary speculation cannot \\naccount for the final bill's actual language. \\nFinally, respondent argues that Congress was obvi-\\nously not focused on foreclosures because it mentioned many States with \\\"'no debt collection laws,'\\\" whereas every State had laws regulating foreclosures. Br. 26-27. \\nRespondent plainly misreads  this statement. The leg-\\nislative commentary focused on laws \\\"regulating debt col-lection per se.\\\" H.R. Rep.

There is an obvious difference between a scheme \\ntargeting debt collectors as such  and one incidentally reg-\\nulating activity where debt collectors may practice. Every \\nState, for example, presumably also had laws prohibiting assault and mail fraud, but no  one confuses those prohibi-\\ntions with a debt-collector-spe cific code of conduct.

No principle compels \\nsuch an anomalous result, and this Court should not \\ncreate an Article III except ion that excludes nominal-\\ndamages awards from ordinary justiciability rules. \\nThe officials do not contest that their actions \\ncaused Chike and Joseph real injury. Their argument is that nominal damages do not redress past injuries. \\nBut nominal damages vindic ate constitutional viola-\\ntions, including where the harm is not quantifiable. \\nMemphis Cmty. Sch. Dist. v. Stachura , 477 U.S. 299, \\n308 n.11 (1986) (quoting Carey v. Piphus , 435 U.S. \\n247, 266 (1978)). And contrary to the Eleventh Circuit's belief, they do so \\\"for the plaintiff's benefit.\\\" \\nFarrar v. Hobby , 506 U.S. 103, 113 (1992). Those \\nprinciples, common-law history, and common sense all show that a nominal-damages award provides a \\npersonal, tangible benefit that redresses a plaintiff's \\ninjury. Article III requires nothing more. \\nProviding a remedy to plaintiffs like Chike and \\nJoseph has neither flooded the courts with lawsuits \\nnor bankrupted officials in the many circuits that \\nallow standalone nominal-damages awards. Nominal \\ndamages, like compensato ry damages, have \\\"coex-\\nisted with our constitutional system since the dawn of the Republic.\\\" Tanzin v. Tanvir , __ S. Ct. __, 2020 WL \\n7250100, at 5 (Dec. 10, 2020). And a nation of laws \\nrequires  a way for courts to make things right when \\nofficials violate rights. Because nominal-damages claims satisfy Arti cle III, this Court should reverse. \\n2 \\nREPLY ARGUMENT  \\nI. T h i s  C o u r t  s h o u l d  d e c l i n e  t o  c r e a t e  a n  \\nArticle III exception that excludes nominal-\\ndamages awards from ordinary justicia-\\nbility rules. \\nThe officials do not deny that Chike and Joseph \\nsuffered a concrete injury-in-fact, nor do they deny \\ncausation. Their only objection is redressability. In making that objection, they confuse redressability \\nwith quantifiability . Because nominal damages \\nvindicate past legal violations, Chike and Joseph's nominal-damages claims s atisfy Article III and are \\nnot moot. \\nA. Nominal damages redress past constitu-\\ntional injury. \\nArticle III standing requires  a plaintiff to show he \\nhas suffered (1) a concrete and particularized injury-\\nin-fact, (2) caused by the defendant, (3) that is likely \\nto be redressed by a favorable court ruling. Spokeo, \\nInc. v. Robins , 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016). The \\nofficials do not dispute injury or causation. And \\nredressability requires only that a plaintiff personally \\n\\\"benefit in a tangible way from\\\" court intervention. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't , 523 U.S. 83, \\n103 n.5 (1998) (quotation omitted). A plaintiff \\nsatisfies that test by showing that a court order would \\n\\\"partially redress\\\" his injury. Meese v. Keene , 481 U.S. \\n465, 476 (1987). Nominal-damages awards, though \\nsmall, satisfy that standard.\\n1 \\n \\n1 The officials articulate a second redressability requirement: \\nthat the relief \\\"target and redress the plaintiff's asserted injury\\\" \\nrather than someone else's. Resp.Br.12. But that is no different \\nthan requiring that the remedy \\\"personally\\\" benefit the plaintiff. \\n3 \\nThe officials confuse redressability with quanti-\\nfiability. Consider a studen t who shared her faith on \\ncampus by chalking messages about Jesus Christ on \\nthe sidewalk, only to see a professor direct his class to erase them.\\n2 Even if the officials modified their \\npolicies to prevent this First Amendment violation \\nfrom happening again, the officials admit that this student could litigate to final judgment her 1\\u00a2 \\ncompensatory-damages claim for the consumed chalk. \\nEven a single penny of relief partially benefits the stu-dent personally and in a tangible way. \\nNow consider Chike. The officials do not dispute \\nhe was injured when they twice stopped him from speaking. The problem is that he cannot monetize the \\nlost speech's value. But Chike's lost speech is far more \\nvaluable than the consumed chalk. And it is the lost \\nspeech that gives Chike the right to seek judicial \\nredress; the $1 in nominal damages that officials \\nmust pay Chike is no less a partial redress that personally and tangibly benefits him than is the \\npenny that redresses the chalk user. A nominal-\\ndamages award \\\"modifies th e defendant's behavior \\nfor the plaintiff's benefit by forcing the defendant to \\npay an amount of money he otherwise would not pay.\\\" \\nFarrar , 506 U.S. at 113. And in this way, the payment \\nof nominal damages \\\"materially alters\\\" the parties' \\nlegal relationship, id. at 111\\u201312, in the same way as \\na modest compensatory-damages award. \\n \\n \\n2 Compare with Fresno State Students for Life  v. Thatcher , No. \\n1:17-at-00382 (E.D. Cal.), available at https://perma.cc/566E-\\n6EBZ. . \\n4 \\nThe officials say that whil e one dollar in compen-\\nsatory damages redresses a past injury, one dollar in \\nnominal damages does not. Resp.Br.17\\u201319. Again, \\nthis is confusion over quantifiability. Contra City of \\nRiverside v. Rivera , 477 U.S. 561, 574 (1986) \\n(plaintiff's vindication of \\\"important civil and \\nconstitutional rights that cannot be valued solely in monetary terms\\\"). Courts  award nominal damages \\nprimarily when there has been an \\\"infraction of a \\nlegal right\\\" but the \\\"extent of loss is not shown.\\\" C\\nHARLES T. MCCORMICK , HANDBOOK ON THE LAW OF \\nDAMAGES  \\u00a7 20 at 85 (1935). So it's not that nominal \\ndamages offer \\\" zero legally recognized relief for a past \\ninjury,\\\" Resp.Br.19 (emphasis added), it's that they \\noffer partial relief. Skyline Wesleyan Church v. Cal. \\nDep't of Managed Health Care , 968 F.3d 738, 749 (9th \\nCir. 2020) (\\\"Nominal damages would redress \\nSkyline's injury, even if only to a minimal extent.\\\"). \\nAnd because nominal dama ges \\\"materially alter[  ]\\\" \\nthe parties' relationship, Farrar , 506 U.S. at 111\\u201312, \\nthat is sufficient for Article III. Meese , 481 U.S. at 476. \\n\\\"Nothing more is needed to establish redressability.\\\" Skyline , 968 F.3d at 749. Otherwise, justiciability of \\nidentical claims turns on mere semantics. ACLU Br. \\n11\\u201312 (discussing Freenor v. Mayor & Alderman of \\nSavannah , No. CV414-247, 2019 WL 9936663 (S.D. \\nGa. May 20, 2019)). \\nAs this Court intimated in Carey , nominal dam-\\nages make a constitutional deprivation \\\"actionable.\\\" \\n435 U.S. at 266. That is because they redress a plain-\\ntiff's concrete and particula rized injury in a personal, \\ntangible way. U.S.Br.17\\u201319 (same result if Congress \\nauthorized a minimum $1,000 award for First \\nAmendment violations). A nominal-damages award partially redresses a loss of incalculable value. \\n5 \\nB. This Court's decisions confirm that \\nnominal damages' primary purpose is \\npast redress of valuable\\u2014even \\npriceless\\u2014rights. \\nNominal damages\\u2014like other remedies\\u2014have \\nmultiple effects that can include the declaration of \\nrights or the protection of prospective rights. But this \\nCourt's precedents and numerous lower-court \\ndecisions show that nominal damages' primary \\npurpose is to redress past legal violations. \\nCarey  decided that nominal damages, rather than \\npresumed damages, were the appropriate award for \\nconstitutional violations where harm cannot be mon-etized. 435 U.S. at 266. But the context was not \\\"pro-\\nspective redress.\\\" Contra Resp.Br.24. It was about \\nremedying a past \\\"deprivation\\\" of rights. 435 U.S. at \\n266. That is why the Court did not speak in terms of \\nany \\\"prospective\\\" due-process problem but to the past \\n\\\"denial of procedur al due process.\\\" Ibid. Accord, e.g., \\nStachura , 477 U.S. at 308 & n.11 (same point in free-\\nspeech context); Arizonans for Official English v. \\nArizona , 520 U.S. 43, 69 & n.24 (1997) (contrasting \\nnominal damages and injunctive relief). \\nLikewise, in Farrar , the plaintiff dropped a claim \\nfor injunctive relief and pursued only an unsuccessful compensatory-damages claim.  506 U.S. at 106. In \\ndetermining that a nominal-damages award made the \\nplaintiff a prevailing party under \\u00a7  1983, this Court \\nemphasized that \\\" Carey  obligates a court to award \\nnominal damages when a plaintiff establishes the \\nviolation of his [constitutional] right.\\\" Id. at 112. That \\nis, this Court correctly saw the award of nominal \\ndamages as retrospective redress, not prospective \\nprotection. \\n6 \\nUnsurprisingly, lower courts have consistently \\nrelied on this Court's cases to hold that a plaintiff \\nwhose constitutional rights have been violated \\n\\\"should not lose his right to proceed\\\" if \\\"only nominal damages are at stake.\\\" Amato v. City of Saratoga \\nSprings , 170 F.3d 311, 319 (2d Cir. 1999) (discussing \\nCarey ). Petitioners' opening brief discussed many \\nsuch cases. Pet.Br.27\\u201328. Yet the officials fail to \\nrespond to many. There are more examples, in count-\\nless settings. E.g., ACLU Br. 13\\u201319; Found. for \\nIndividual Rights in Educ. [FIRE] Br. 5\\u20139; Becket Fund Br. 20\\u201325; Pacific Legal Found. Br. 1\\u20134, 12\\u201316.  \\nThe officials' rule also vi olates this Court's prece-\\ndent in analogous contexts. For example, the officials \\ninsist that statutory damages are \\\"different in kind\\\" \\nbecause they \\\"do not signify nothing .\\\" Resp.Br.19\\u201320. \\nBut statutory and nominal damages serve the same \\npurpose: providing \\\"recompense for injury\\\" where \\n\\\"the rules of law render diff icult or impossible proof of \\ndamages.\\\" Douglas v. Cunningham , 294 U.S. 207, 209 \\n(1935). The officials concede that it \\\"is good enough \\nfor Article III\\\" when Congre ss sets statutory damages \\nwhere it \\\"might be hard to measure\\\" actual damages. \\nResp.Br.19\\u201320. It is no different when courts award \\nnominal damages for the same reason. \\nThe same is true of liquidated damages, which \\nassign a fixed value to harm where actual damages \\n\\\"may be difficult or impossible to ascertain.\\\" Rex \\nTrailer Co. v. United States , 350 U.S. 148, 153\\u201354 \\n(1956). And punitive dama ges are non-compensatory \\nand sometimes awarded without compensatory harm. U.S.Br.19\\u201320. Yet the offici als do not dispute that a \\nplaintiff with a standalone claim for statutory, \\nliquidated, or punitive da mages has failed to present \\nan Article III case or controversy. \\n7 \\nThe officials criticize Chike and Joseph for \\nequating \\\"vindication\\\" of rights with Article III \\nredress. Resp.Br.21\\u201323. But where \\\"there has been a \\nviolation of a right, the person injured is entitled to an action. If he is entitled to an action, he is entitled \\nat least to nominal damages,  or else he would not be \\nentitled to a recovery.\\\" Parker v. Griswold , 17 Conn. \\n288, 303 (1846). \\nC. At common law, courts routinely award-\\ned standalone nominal damages solely to redress past injuries. \\nNo one disputes that English and American \\ncommon-law courts consistently adjudicated claims for nominal damages in a wide array of cases, and \\nthat such claims arose from a past violation of rights. \\nYet the officials insist that when common-law courts \\ndid award nominal damages, it was only for \\ncontinuing or threatened injuries. Resp.Br.28\\u201340. \\nCenturies of cases debunk this theory. \\nFor one thing, the officials concede that entire cat-\\negories of common-law cases involved the award of \\nnominal damages even \\\"whe n they would not plainly \\nserve as prospective relief.\\\" Id. at 34. These include \\ncases (like this one) when the plaintiff \\\"proved a legal \\nviolation\\\" but failed to establish or quantify compensatory damages, ibid. , \\\"as a vehicle for costs,\\\" \\nid. at 32\\u201334, or for \\\"dignitary harms,\\\" id. at 38. And \\nthese categories of cases\\u2014which alone undermine the officials' historical analysis\\u2014are just a few examples. \\nEnglish courts inferred nominal damages when-\\never the plaintiff establish ed an invasion of a legal \\nright, no matter if ther e was a continuing or \\nthreatened injury. \\\"[I]njury imports a damage, \\nthough it does not cost the party one farthing.\\\" Ashby  \\n8 \\nv. White , 92 Eng. Rep. 126, 137 (1703) (Holt, J.). \\nCourts \\\"import[ed] a dama ge\\\" for various claims, \\nincluding breach of contract, trespass, and personal \\ninjury. Ibid.  (\\\"a cuff on the ear\\\" would be actionable \\n\\\"for it is a personal injury\\\").  \\nFor personal rights, nominal damages served to \\nremedy past harms, not to  protect against future \\ninjury. In Ashby , for example, the House of Lords held \\nthat an elector who was wrongfully turned away from \\nthe polls by an official could sue without proving the \\\"possibility of a future profi t\\\" or the \\\"possibility of a \\nfuture\\\" damage. 87 Eng. Rep. 810, 810, 813 (1703) \\n(Powell, J., & Gould, J.). Often these violations occurred when an official fa iled to perform his duty \\nbut cured the defect before suit. In these cases, plain-\\ntiffs could still recover nominal damages for the past \\ninjury even though they had no need for prospective \\nrelief. E.g., Barker v. Green , 130 Eng. Rep. 327, 327 \\n(1824) (sheriff's one-day delay in arrest on writ); Bales \\nv. Wingfield , 4 Q.B. 580, n. (multi-week delay by \\nsheriff in executing a lien writ); Clifton  v. Hooper , 115 \\nEng. Rep. 175, 175, 178 (1844) (sheriff delay in exe-cuting process). This was al so true for actions brought \\nagainst private citizens. E.g., Marzetti v. Williams , \\n109 Eng. Rep. 842, 845\\u201347 (1830) (one-day delay in issuing check); Godefroy  v. Jay, 131 Eng. Rep. 159, \\n159\\u201362 (1831) (client could receive nominal damages \\nfor attorney's negligence). \\nAmerican courts followed suit. Plaintiffs could \\nrecover at least nominal damages for injuries caused \\nby public officials without showing the threat of future harm. E.g.,  Mickles v. Hart , 1 Denio 548, 550 \\n(N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1845) (sheriff deputy's delay in \\nexecuting debt); Laflin v. Willard , 33 Mass. 64, 67 \\n(1835) (same); Waterhouse v. Waite , 11 Mass. 207, 210 \\n9 \\n(1814) (same); Burns v. Erben , 26 How. Pr. 273, 277 \\n(N.Y. Super. Ct. 1864) (false imprisonment); Doherty  \\nv. Munson , 127 Mass. 495, 496 (1879) (detention \\nunder illegal warrant). And American courts routinely awarded nominal damages in private \\nactions when such an award could provide no \\nprospective relief. E.g., Thompson  v. New Orleans, J. \\n& G.N.R. Co. , 50 Miss. 315, 320 (1874) (train \\nconductor passed passenger's stop by two miles); \\nCrosby v. Humphreys , 60 N.W. 843, 844 (Minn. 1894) \\n(assault); Young v. W. Union Tel. Co. , 11 S.E. 1044, \\n1044\\u201345 (N.C. 1890) (negligent delay in delivering \\ntelegraph); McKim  v. Bartlett , 129 Mass. 226, 229 \\n(1880) (estate administrator liable for at least nomi-nal damages after court discharged future liability).  \\nThis partial list shows that early American \\ncourts\\u2014like their English counterparts\\u2014undeniably \\nawarded nominal damages so lely for past injuries. \\nAccord, e.g., U.S.Br.10\\u201311; Nat'l Right to Work Legal \\nDef. Found. Br. 4\\u201310. \\nEven a nominal-damages award in a trespass, \\nriparian-rights, or other pr operty case was intended, \\nfirst and foremost, to vindicate the past \\\"violation of \\nthe plaintiff's right.\\\" Delaware & Hudson Canal Co.  \\nv. Torrey , 33 Pa. 143, 148 (1859); accord Embrey v. \\nOwen , 155 Eng. Rep. 579, 585 (1851) (same). And that \\nis why common-law courts awarded nominal damages \\nin property cases even when the parties' future rights \\nand obligations were not at stake. E.g., Hefley  v. \\nBaker , 19 Kan. 9, 11 (1877) (pure trespass case with \\nno property-line dispute); Curtis v. Paggett , 27 P. 109, \\n109\\u201310 (Kan. 1891) (same); Cook v. Loomis , 26 Conn. \\n483, 486 (1857) (trover case where property already \\nreturned); Mears v. Cornwall , 40 N.W. 931, 932\\u201334 \\n(Mich. 1888) (same); Warder v. Baldwin , 8 N.W. 257, \\n10 \\n258 (Wis. 1881) (same); Moon v. Raphael , 132 Eng. \\nRep. 122, 122 (1835) (same). And plaintiffs at common \\nlaw could waive their right to compensatory damages \\nand choose to seek nominal damages alone. Pet.Br.42; \\naccord Daniels v. Bates , 2 Greene 151, 152 (Iowa \\n1849); Pastorius v. Fisher , 1 Rawle 27, 29 (Pa. 1828). \\nThe officials' failure to address so many of these \\ncases is no mere oversight. Many are on all fours with \\nthe constitutional violations at issue here and \\nestablish the common-law ru le that nominal damages \\nsupport a claim for past constitutional violations. So \\ndo cases involving intentional torts. Frederick \\nDouglass Found. Br. 6\\u20138 (c omparing Petitioners' \\ninjuries to those caused by intentional torts, for which \\ncourts awarded nominal damages); Stachura , 477 \\nU.S. at 306 (level of \\u00a7  1983 damages \\\"determined \\naccording to principles de rived from the common law \\nof torts\\\"). \\nThe officials say that, even if common-law courts \\nawarded nominal damages with no \\\"prospective \\nremedial benefits,\\\" such awards were meaningless \\nand insufficient \\\"for maintaining an action.\\\" Resp.Br.35\\u201336. But as detailed above, countless cases \\nheld that a standalone nominal-damages claim \\nsustained a case having no effect on future rights. It would be passing strange for so many courts, over so \\nmany years, to adjudicate  nominal-damages claims \\nthat they thought served no purpose and, in the officials' view, violated redressability requirements. \\nFinally, while early common-law courts may have \\nbeen unwilling to reverse a trial court's failure to award nominal damages in trifling or frivolous cases, \\nResp.Br.34\\u201335; Fleming  v. Gilbert , 3 Johns 528, 532 \\n(N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1808); Robertson v. Gentry , 5 Ky. 542, \\n11 \\n543 (Ct. App. 1812), that reluctance faded when \\n\\\"important\\\" rights were at stake. Blackburn v. Ala. \\nGreat S. R. Co. , 39 So. 345, 346 (Ala. 1905); Hecht  v. \\nHarrison , 40 P. 306, 309\\u201310 (Wyo. 1895). Modern \\ncourts view nominal damages the same way when a \\nplaintiff alleges a constitutional violation. E.g., Risdal \\nv. Halford , 209 F.3d 1071, 1073 (8th Cir. 2000) \\n(reversing for plain error because the district court \\nfailed to instruct the jury  to award nominal damages \\nif it found a free-speech violation); Zok v. State , 903 \\nP.2d 574, 579 (Alaska 1995) (failure to award nominal \\ndamages for unlawful arrest was plain error because \\nthe \\\"right to be free from unlawful confinement is sufficiently important and fundamental in our \\nsociety\\\"). Indeed, circuit co urts uniformly hold that an \\naward of nominal damages is mandatory upon \\nproving a constitutional violation. Pet.Br.30\\u201331 n.4 \\n(collecting cases). The officials' cramped theory of \\nnominal damages cannot explain away this history. \\nD. Nominal damages are not a mere \\nanalogue for declaratory relief. \\nNominal damages' primary purpose is to redress \\na past injury. Yet the officials continue to assert that \\n\\\"[d]eclaratory judgments are the analogue,\\\" \\nResp.Br.41, unless sovereign or qualified immunity is at stake, in which case th e officials feel differently, id. \\nat 42 n.3. The officials are incorrect. U.S.Br.23\\u201327. \\nTo be sure, \\\"all judgments of courts declare jural \\nrelations.\\\" Edwin M. Borchard, The Declaratory \\nJudgment\\u2014A Needed Procedural Reform , 28 Y\\nALE \\nL.J. 1, 4 (1918). Yet courts do not equate all forms of \\nrelief with declaratory judgments just because they share this one trait. \\n12 \\nNor do the officials rebut the many other differ-\\nences between declaratory judgments and nominal \\ndamages that unravel their flawed analogy. First, \\nnominal damages are legal relief, while declaratory judgments are equitable. Resp.Br.42 n.3. Second, \\ndeclaratory judgments were designed to determine \\nlegal rights \\\" before breach .\\\" Edwin M. Borchard, The \\nUniform Act on Declaratory Judgments , 34 H\\nARV. L. \\nREV. 697, 707 (1921). Nominal damages remedy past \\nharm, unavailable until an injury has occurred. C\\nHARLES T. MCCORMICK , HANDBOOK ON THE LAW OF \\nDAMAGES  \\u00a7 20 at 85 (1935) (\\\"Nominal damages are \\nawarded for the infraction of a legal right.\\\"). \\nThird, declaratory judgments are primarily \\nprospective relief, Christian Legal Soc'y v. Martinez , \\n561 U.S. 661, 676 n.6 (2010), while nominal damages, \\nwhich require a past violation, are primarily retro-\\nspective, Arizonans for Official English , 520 U.S. at \\n69 & n.24.   Fourth, the Declaratory Judgment Act \\n\\\"confers a discretion  on the courts,\\\" not an \\\"absolute \\nright upon the litigant.\\\" Wilton v. Seven Falls Co. , 515 \\nU.S. 277, 287 (1995). Nominal damages are manda-tory. Farrar , 506 U.S. at 112 (\\\" Carey obligate[d] a \\ncourt to award nominal damages when a plaintiff \\nestablishes the violation of his right\\\"). And finally, \\nunlike declaratory judgments,  courts have held that \\nnominal damages are subject to sovereign- and \\nqualified-immunity defenses. E.g., Am. Civil Liberties \\nUnion v. U.S. Conf. of Cath. Bishops , 705 F.3d 44, 53 \\nn.7 (1st Cir. 2013) (sovereign immunity); Hopkins v. \\nSaunders , 199 F.3d 968, 978 (8th Cir. 1999) (qualified \\nimmunity). \\nIn sum, the disparities between declaratory judg-\\nments and nominal damages are stark. And rightly \\nso, as their primary purpose is decidedly different. \\n13 \\nE. The officials' view of nominal damages \\ncontradicts Article III requirements. \\nRationalizing some of the many instances in \\nwhich common-law courts awarded nominal damages \\nfor the past violation of rights, the officials argue that \\nthe \\\"jurisdictional hook\\\" is \\\"the plaintiff's live claim \\nfor compensatory damages.\\\" Resp.Br.26. This hook saves a nominal-damages claim from mootness, say \\nthe officials, even if the plaintiff's compensatory-\\ndamages claim fail s on the merits. Ibid.  That \\nreasoning cannot be right. \\nTo begin, \\\"a plaintiff must demonstrate standing \\nfor each claim he seeks to press and for each form of relief that is sought.\\\" Town of Chester v. Laroe Ests., \\nInc., 137 S. Ct. 1645, 1650 (2017) (citation omitted). It \\nis impossible for a compensatory-damage remedy to \\nbe a \\\"jurisdictional hook\\\" for a separate, moot remedy. \\nA nominal-damages remedy mu st (and does) stand on \\nits own merits from the case's inception. \\nIn addition, \\\"an actual controversy must be extant \\nat all stages of review, not merely at the time the com-\\nplaint is filed.\\\" Arizonans for Official English , 520 \\nU.S. at 67 (citation omitted). Once a plausible claim \\nfor compensatory damages fail s at the merits stage, it \\nis again impossible for that claim to be a \\\"jurisdictional hook\\\" for a separate, moot claim. \\nMoreover, a plaintiff must quantify injury to \\nclaim compensatory damage s. Yet the loss of First \\nAmendment freedoms like speech and religious \\nexercise constitutes \\\"irreparable injury.\\\" Roman \\nCatholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , __ S. Ct. __, \\n2020 WL 6948354, at 3 (Nov. 25, 2020). Such injury \\n\\\"cannot be adequately measured or compensated by \\nmoney.\\\" Irreparable Injury , B\\nLACK 'S LAW DICTIONARY  \\n14 \\n(11th ed. 2019). The officials' position would lead to \\nthe indefensible result that the appropriate remedy \\nfor a past violation of rights is one that in some cases \\nwill not be available. \\nFinally, the officials' position deprives some \\nvictims of government misconduct of any remedy. The \\nofficials say that without plausible compensatory-damages remedies, plaintiffs can still \\\"vindicate their \\nrights through claims for prospective relief like \\ninjunctions and declaratory judgments.\\\" Resp.Br.46\\u201348. But that only underscor es the correctness of Chike \\nand Joseph's position: that eliminating the nominal-\\ndamages remedy would allo w officials to make a \\nstrategic post-filing change in policy solely to moot \\nprospective relief. Such a risk is real because \\ngovernment officials have strong incentives to moot \\ncases. Becket Fund Br. 8\\u201314; Joseph C. Davis & \\nNicholas R. Reaves, The Point Isn't Moot: How Lower \\nCourts Have Blessed Go vernment Abuse of the \\nVoluntary-Cessation Doctrine , 129 Y\\nALE L.J.  FORUM  \\n325 (2019). The officials propose a phantom remedy to \\ninsulate their unconstitutional acts from legal accountability. \\n  \\n15 \\nII. The officials' reasons for creating a nominal-\\ndamages exception to Article III are indefensible. \\nThe officials predict dire  effects if this Court \\nallows partial redress for the violation of Chike and \\nJoseph's rights. Yet it ha s been \\\"widely recognized\\\" \\nfor ages \\\"that a claim for nominal damages precludes mootness\\\" based on later events. N.Y. State Rifle & \\nPistol Ass'n v. City of N.Y. , 140 S. Ct. 1525, 1536 \\n(2020) (Alito, J., dissenting); Pet.Br.14 n.2 (catalog-uing eight circuits' rule). None of these asserted \\nconsequences have material ized in the jurisdictions \\nthat have rejected the Eleventh Circuit's novel and indefensible approach. The officials' arguments lack \\nmerit. \\nA. The majority rule does not require \\nadvisory opinions. \\nThe officials say that nominal-damages claims \\ninvite advisory opinions. Resp.Br. 2, 9\\u201310, 22, 41\\u201342. Not so. To quote the officials' own cases, advisory opinions \\\"advis[e] what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\\\" Aetna Life Ins. Co. of \\nHartford v. Haworth , 300 U.S. 227, 241 (1937). \\nAccord, e.g., Preiser v. Newkirk , 422 U.S. 395, 401 \\n(1975) (same);  Ashcroft v. Mattis , 431 U.S. 171, 172 \\n(1977) (per curiam). That's not the request here. \\nChike and Joseph present real-world facts and \\n\\\"concrete legal issues, presented in [an] actual case[  ],\\\" \\nGolden v. Zwickler , 394 U.S. 103, 108 (1969): whether \\nofficials violated their free -speech rights. It is not \\nclear why the officials believe that question is more hypothetical here than if Chike's speech had con-sumed 1\\u00a2 of chalk, particularly when the officials do \\n16 \\nnot contest he suffered a cognizable injury-in-fact. \\nThere is nothing advisory about deciding the question \\nand awarding nominal damages.

Many constitutional \\ncases seek only prospectiv e relief, either because \\ndamages are barred by sovereign immunity or because the injury is threatened or imminent but has not yet occurred at the time of filing. The mootness doctrine is alive and well for those cases. The \\nsituation here\\u2014where the officials already violated \\nChike's and Joseph's constitutional rights\\u2014presents \\nthe flip side of mootness: fed eral courts are obligated \\nto adjudicate live controversies. Knox v. Serv. Emps. \\nInt'l Union, Local 1000 , 567 U.S. 298, 307\\u201308 (2012). \\nPlus, the officials' concer n for the vitality of the \\nmootness doctrine is selective. They concede that the \\ndoctrine has not crumbled ev en though a plaintiff can \\navoid mootness by seeking compensation for negli-gible financial damages. Resp.Br.49. So, it will not disintegrate if a plaintiff seeks justice without putting \\nhimself and the courts through the trouble and \\ndisproportionate expense of monetizing, proving, and \\nassessing those injuries, as long experience in the courts of appeals attests. Ar ticle III does not require \\nplaintiffs to repackage no minal-damages claims as \\nsmall damages claims. Both types of claims ensure a \\nlive controversy. \\n17 \\nFar more troublesome problems arise under the \\nofficials' rule, which allows governments to moot \\ncases unilaterally and strategically. That approach \\nallows officials to reinstate unconstitutional policies, a phenomenon that the amici have well documented. \\nFIRE Br. 24\\u201327; Becket Fund Br. 10\\u201314; Just. & Free-\\ndom Fund Br. 9, 15\\u201316 & n.4. It creates incentives for officials to run out the clock on many claims, e.g., \\ndelaying until students gr aduate, or prisoners get \\ntransferred. Islam & Religious Freedom Br. 14\\u201315; Inst. for Free Speech Br. 14\\u20131 5; Becket Fund Br. 23\\u2013\\n25; Christian Legal Soc'y Br. 15\\u201317; FIRE Br. 5\\u20137. \\nIn short, the officials' mootness-related policy \\nconcerns do not justify their invitation to jettison the \\nmajority rule and create a nominal-damages excep-\\ntion to Article III. \\nC. The majority rule neither wastes judicial \\nresources nor prolongs cases.  \\nThe officials and their amici say that the enduring \\nmajority rule wastes judicial resources, prolongs \\nlawsuits, and increases attorney fees. Resp.Br.45; \\nD.C.Br. 13\\u201321. But government officials who quickly and \\\"reasonably respond\\\" when initially alerted to an unconstitutional policy, D.C.Br. 4\\u201311, rarely face protracted litigation. \\nConsider what happened here. Three years before \\nChike tried to speak on campus\\u2014in 2013 \\u2014counsel \\ninformed Georgia Gwinnett officials that their poli-cies were unconstitutional. Pet.App.89a\\u201390a. The of-ficials did nothing. Chike questioned the overbreadth and inconsistency of the officia ls' policies when he was \\nordered to stop speaking in 2016. Id. at 100a\\u201302a. \\nAgain, officials did nothing. When Chike filed suit in \\n18 \\nDecember 2016, the officials did not recant; they dou-\\nbled down, insisting that sharing the Christian faith \\n\\\"arguably rose to the level of 'fighting words'\\\" that the \\nFirst Amendment does not protect. Id. at 155a. \\nIt was not until much later in the case that the \\nofficials changed their unconstitutional policies and then promptly moved to dismiss. Id. at 160a. Imagine \\nhow much litigation and how many constitutional \\ndeprivations the officials could have avoided simply \\nby \\\"reasonably responding\\\" in 2013. \\nThe reality is officials oft en stubbornly refuse to \\nconcede that they have vi olated someone's constitu-\\ntional rights. E.g., N.Y. State Rifle & Pistol Ass'n , 140 \\nS. Ct. at 1538\\u201339 (Alito, J., dissenting) (city fought the \\nplaintiffs' Second Amendment rights \\\"tooth and nail\\\" \\nin lower courts, then strategically changed policy to \\n\\\"moot\\\" the case on the eve of oral argument in this Court). The amici briefs are replete with such examples. E.g., Becket Fund Br. 3 (prison changed \\npolicy \\\"[t]wo weeks before oral argument\\\"); \\nCatholicVote.org Br. 12 n.4 (city repealed ordinance \\n\\\"years into litigation\\\" an d \\\"days\\\" after grant of en \\nbanc review); Pacific Legal Found. Br. 1\\u20132 (city repealed ban \\\"[o]n the eve of oral argument\\\"); FIRE Br. 7 (universities \\\"disavow[  ]\\\" policies \\\"after the \\nstart of litigation\\\"). And though the District of \\nColumbia amici say the Eleventh Circuit's rule \\n\\\"incentivizes government actors to revisit challenged laws,\\\" the brief's listed examples all come from outside the Eleventh Circuit. D.C.Br. 4\\u201311. Indeed, the officials here changed their policies several months before  the Eleventh Circuit adopted its outlier \\nrule, further proving that the majority rule already \\nencourages officials to do the right thing. \\n19 \\nConversely, the longstanding rule does not \\nencourage plaintiffs to pursue pointless litigation \\nsimply to inflict an attorn ey-fee award. This \\\"Court's \\ndecision not to grant fees in Farrar was born of its \\nreluctance to reward attorneys for bringing less than \\nmeritorious claims that see k, but fail to obtain, large \\nmonetary judgments or fail to promote a larger public good.\\\" Project Vote/Voting for Am., Inc.  v. Dickerson , \\n444 F. App'x 660, 664 (4th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) \\n(citing Farrar , 506 U.S. at 116). The same will be true \\nin cases brought simply to harass. But a meritorious \\ncivil-rights claim brought to stop unconstitutional government conduct \\\"is the very form of litigation Congress wished to encourage by enacting \\u00a7  1988.\\\" \\nIbid.  (citing Daly v. Hill, 790 F.2d 1071, 1084 (4th Cir. \\n1986)). Accord, e.g., Fox v. Vice, 563 U.S. 826, 832\\u201333 \\n(2011) (characterizing a successful \\u00a7 1983 plaintiff pursuing \\u00a7 1988 fees as \\\"a private attorney general\\\") (citation omitted). \\\"Deterring meritorious lawsuits on constitutional issues because they offer a small \\nlikelihood of a significant money judgment presents \\nas grave a danger to our legal system as frivolous litigation.\\\" Project Vote , F. App'x at 664\\u201365 (quoting \\nKoopman v. Water Dist. No. 1 of Johnson Cnty. , 41 \\nF.3d 1417, 1421 (10th Cir. 1994)). Accord Rutherford Inst. Br. 7\\u201312 (discussing implications of tactical \\nmooting).  \\nIt's not even clear that following the majority rule \\nwould appreciably increase caseloads. The officials \\nhave provided no evidence that the circuits applying \\nthe majority rule have been overwhelmed with nominal-damages cases. Contra Inst. for Free Speech \\nBr. 16\\u201317 n.11 (statistics showing the opposite). In \\nthe long run, reaching the merits conserves judicial \\n20 \\nresources by produc ing precedent that obviates future \\ndisputes\\u2014sometimes on precisely the same issue,  \\nwhere unconstitutional policies are reinstated after a \\ncase has been strategically mooted. Id. at 17; The \\nPoint Isn't Moot , 129 Y ALE L.J.  FORUM  at 338\\u201341. \\nFinally, the most effective way to minimize \\nconstitutional violations is to hold recalcitrant officials accountable, not to deny victims the remedy \\nArticle III allows. Just. & Freedom Fund Br. 17\\u201318; \\ncontra Br. of Nat'l Conf. of State Legislatures 23\\u201324. When, as here, a prospective plaintiff sends government officials a warning letter, alerting them to unconstitutional conduct, the potential negative consequences of a future judgment, see Br. of Nat'l \\nConf. of State Legislatures 23\\u201324, are precisely what \\nmotivate the officials to change course. Officials who \\nknow they can violate constitutional rights without cost have no incentive to stop violating the Constitution. \\nIn sum, allowing the gove rnment to unilaterally \\nmoot claims for past consti tutional violations would \\nundermine the vindication of constitutional rights \\nand the Constitution itself. After all, courts are the \\\"department of the government to whom the protection of the rights of the individual is by the \\nconstitution especially confided.\\\" 1\\n ST. GEORGE \\nTUCKER , BLACKSTONE 'S COMMENTARIES , App. 357 \\n(1803). Prohibiting the government from doing so would not change the prevailing legal landscape. \\n  \\n21 \\nIII. The officials' rule would leave plaintiffs \\nwithout a remedy and result in more violations of constitutional rights.  \\nAbandoning the majority rule would leave some \\nvictims of constitutional violations without a remedy. \\nEquitable relief is often unavailable or easily mooted \\n(as shown here), and constitutional violations often do not cause quantifiable harm. Pet.Br.37; FIRE Br. 5\\u20139. The officials fail to meaningfully engage these points. \\nThe officials first insist that these claims \\\"can \\noften be adjudicated\\\" via \\\"prospective relief.\\\" \\nResp.Br.46. But \\\"can often\\\" means \\\"not always,\\\" since such relief is available only when the illegal conduct \\\"might happen again.\\\" Ibid. Those mistreated under \\na later-repealed policy or  subjected to \\\"one-off\\\" \\nviolations have no such reme dy. This gives officials at \\nleast one \\\"free pass\\\" to violate the Constitution.   \\nSuch a rule also artificia lly constricts the judici-\\nary's ability and duty to protect individual rights \\nbased on an unsupported as surance that officials will \\nuse this leeway altruistic ally and correct mistakes \\nquickly. Perhaps the offic ials' suggested approach \\nwould work if we were governed by angels rather than \\nmere \\\"men.\\\" T\\nHE FEDERALIST NO. 51, at 322 (James \\nMadison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961). But amici \\nrecount myriad experiences demonstrating that the judiciary serves as an important check-and-balance. \\nWorse, civil-rights litigants already face daunting \\nterrain:  persuading attorn eys to pro bono represent \\nthem, exhausting administrative remedies, and surviving immunity, which shields all but those who \\ndefy clearly established law. And at least six circuits \\n22 \\nhave even lowered the burden on officials to show a \\ncase is moot. The Point Isn't Moot , 129 Y ALE L.J.  \\nFORUM  at 333, n.50. The Eleventh Circuit, like others, \\ngives government officials \\\"considerably more leeway \\nthan private parties in the presumption that they are \\nunlikely to resume illegal activities.\\\" Coral Springs \\nSt. Sys., Inc.  v. City of Sunrise , 371 F.3d 1320, 1328\\u2013\\n29 (11th Cir. 2004). \\nThis flipped burden forces plaintiffs to prove\\u2014\\nusually with no discovery\\u2014that officials will revert to \\nthe original policy. Yet officials are \\\"more likely to strategically moot cases, not less\\\" than private defendants. The Point Isn't Moot , 129 Y\\nALE L.J.  \\nFORUM  at 335. Accord Becket Fund Br. 8\\u201314; FIRE \\nBr. 24\\u201328; CAIR Br. 15\\u201317. \\nFor \\\"one-off\\\" violations, the officials insist the \\nremedy is compensation. Resp.Br.49\\u201352. But again, this helps only those who ha ve suffered quantifiable \\nharm. And examples abound of constitutional injuries \\nthat often are not compens able, including unlawful \\nentry of private residences, denial of kosher meals in \\nprison, zoning restrictions on religious institutions, door-to-door proselytizin g restrictions, and free \\nspeech claims on campus\\u2014all examples that would transform difficulty pr oving damages into a \\njurisdictional bar. Hudson  v. Michigan , 547 U.S. 586, \\n610 (2006) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (\\\"the majority, like \\nMichigan and the United States, has failed to cite a single reported case in which a plaintiff has collected more than nominal damages solely as a result of a knock-and-announce violation\\\"); Just. & Freedom Fund Br. 5 n.2; CatholicVote .org Br. 16; ACLU Br. \\n17\\u201318; Islam & Religious Freedom Br. 8\\u20139; Becket \\nFund Br. 20\\u201325; Seventh- Day Adventists Br. 20. \\n23 \\nPlus, some religiously motivated plaintiffs only \\nwant justice or are reluctant to seek money damages \\nfor theological reasons. It's a perverse incentive to \\nforce  such plaintiffs to demand compensatory \\ndamages they do not want or need. \\nNor are compensatory damages for intangible \\ninjuries a cure-all. Many circuits require plaintiffs to prove those injuries without relying on their \\nsubjective testimony, and statutes and immunities \\nimpose more hurdles. Becket Fund Br. 15\\u201318. In these and other civil rights ca ses, plaintiffs steer clear \\nof compensatory damages because \\\"causation and quantification of damages are burdensome to litigate,\\\" \\\"there is little prospect of substantial \\nrecovery,\\\" and these clai ms \\\"profoundly irritate[  ] the \\njudge.\\\" Douglas Laycock, The Triumph of Equity , 56 \\nL.\\n & CONTEMP . PROBS . 53, 63 (1993). Discarding the \\nmajority rule on nominal damages leaves no remedy for those plaintiffs who do not have monetizable harm, rendering their rights unenforceable and \\neffectively nonexistent. \\nIf the Court creates an artificial jurisdictional bar \\nthat renders rights unenforceable in certain circum-stances, it is not difficult to predict that more viola-\\ntions of constitutional rights will follow. As this Court \\nhas already recognized, nominal-damages awards \\nensure that constitutional  rights are \\\"scrupulously \\nobserved.\\\" Carey , 435 U.S. at 266. Excluding such \\nawards from Article III would guarantee the opposite outcome. Although this problem extends to many backdrops, the context presented here\\u2014free speech on public college and university campuses\\u2014provides \\na stark illustration. \\n24 \\nNearly 90% of public, postsecondary institutions \\nmaintain policies that severely restrict protected \\nspeech or could be applied to do so. FIRE Br. 14\\u201323. \\nMany of these policies ar e vague and overbroad, \\nincluding granting officials unfettered discretion to \\nsilence and punish, or prohibiting offensive expres-\\nsion based on third-party perceptions ( i.e., heckler \\nvetoes). \\nGiven that evidence, there is a real risk that a \\nnew rule disallowing standalone nominal-damages claims would lead university officials to strategically moot controversies after  a student's rights are \\nviolated. Doubling down on constitutional depriva-tions would inevitably extend off campus to other \\ngovernment officials, endangering not just free speech \\nand religious exercise, but also Second Amendment \\nrights, the right to be free from illegal searches, unlawful detentions, and many others. \\nA constitutional right that cannot be enforced is \\nno right at all. This Court should say so and reverse.  \\n \\n25 \\n\",\n          \" \\n No. 22-166 \\n================================================================================================================ \\nIn The \\nSupreme Court of the United States \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 --------------------------------- \\nGERALDINE TYLER, on behalf of herself \\nand all others similarly situated, \\nPetitioner,        \\nv. \\nHENNEPIN COUNTY, and MARK V.

The late Howard Jarvis, founder of \\nHJTA, utilized the People of  California's reserved \\npower of initiative to sponsor California's well-known Proposition 13 in 1978. Proposition 13 was overwhelm-\\ningly approved by California voters and added Article \\nXIII A to the California Constitution. Proposition 13 has kept thousands of fixed income Californians secure \\nin their ability to stay in their own homes by limiting \\nthe ad valorem property tax rate and annual escala-tion of property taxes.\\n1 \\n HJTA has a central and ongoing interest in pro-\\ntecting homeowners' rights to retain their homes. In \\nthe unfortunate circumstance of financial distress \\nleading to unpaid property taxes and government fore-closure, HJTA continues to  advocate for homeowners \\nbeing able to receive the remaining equity that right-\\nfully belongs to them and, in  all likelihood, will be their \\nsole economic resource for their next stage of life. \\nHJTA has recently supported legislation to that effect \\nin California and written on this vital current topic known as home equity thef t. (Jon Coupal & Joshua \\n \\n 1 Per Rule 37, the parties were notified and consented to the \\nfiling of this brief more than ten days before its filing. See Sup. \\nCt. R. 37.2(a). Blanket consent from Petitioner was also filed Sep-tember 9, 2022. No party's counsel authored any of this brief; ami-\\ncus alone funded its preparation and submission. See Sup. Ct. R. \\n37.6. \\n \\n2 \\n Polk, Stop home equity theft by the state of California , \\nThe Orange County Register (Mar. 27, 2022).2) \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\n The Minnesota statutes at issue violate the Fifth \\nAmendment Takings Clause and the Eighth Amend-\\nment Excessive Fines Clause. They do so by expressly taking home equity for public use without just compen-\\nsation. They also take the owner's equity as excessive \\npunishment for non-payment of taxes, even though in-terest and penalties have already been charged. There \\nis no reason for Ms. Tyler to pay her government a pre-\\nmium of $25,000 on top of the $15,000 she owed, which \\nalready included interest and penalties. \\n \\\"Public use\\\" is clear. The Minnesota statute that \\ndistributed Ms. Tyler's $25,000 in home equity is titled \\n\\\"APPORTIONMENT OF PROCEEDS TO TAXING \\nDISTRICTS.\\\" (Minn. Stat., \\u00a7 282.08.) The more subtle variety of home equity thef t in California also admits \\n\\\"public use\\\" in statute. (Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7 3695.4.) \\n Amicus writes separately to highlight the subtle \\nforms of home equity theft that will likely expand with-\\nout a grant of certiorari in this case. California, men-tioned just briefly in the Petition for Certiorari, is \\nplagued by home equity theft as well, and in dangerous \\n \\n 2 https://www.ocregister.com/2022/03/27/stop-home-equity- \\ntheft-by-the-state -of-california/. \\n3 \\n ways that will fly under the radar without enforcement \\nof the Constitution for Ms. Tyler. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nARGUMENT \\nI. Certiorari should be granted because gov-\\nernment, under the Fifth and Eighth \\nAmendments, must respect, not exploit, vulnerable homeowners. \\nA. No one, includin g government, may ex-\\nploit a tax windfall. \\n Governments do not allow taxpayers to take tax \\nwindfalls. (See Handlery Hotels, Inc. v. Franchise Tax \\nBd. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1360; Franck v. Polaris E-Z \\nGo Div. of Textron  (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 1107.) Gov-\\nernments must likewise not be allowed to take tax \\nwindfalls. As Justice Holmes famously wrote, \\\"[m]en \\nmust turn square corners wh en they deal with the \\nGovernment.\\\" ( Rock Island, A. & L. R. Co. v. United \\nStates  (1920) 254 U.S. 141, 143.) Likewise, particularly \\nwhen so much is at stake, \\\"[ i]t is no less good morals \\nand good law that the Gove rnment should turn square \\ncorners in dealing with the people than that the people \\nshould turn square corners in dealing with their Gov-ernment.\\\" ( St. Regis Paper Co. v. United States  (1961) \\n368 U.S. 208, 229.) Accordingly, governments should \\nnot be trespassers, but trustees, particularly to trag-edy-befallen persons, such as Ms. Tyler, who happen to \\nown a home or other real pro perty that can be levied to \\nsatisfy a tax debt. \\n4 \\n  In this case, as in certain related instances in Cal-\\nifornia, a vulnerable member of society was exploited \\nby her government following a tax sale of her property \\nto cover a delinquency. The Eighth Circuit seems to sanction this as punishment for a distressed home-\\nowner's normal human weaknesses when it writes: \\n\\\"Only after [Ms. Tyler] declined to avail herself of these opportunities did 'abs olute title' pass to the \\nState.\\\" ( Tyler v. Hennepin Cty.  (8th Cir. 2022) 26 F.4th \\n789, 793.) Thus, while the pri mary issue seems to be \\nwhether the retention of Ms. Tyler's $25,000 home eq-\\nuity is a taking under the Fifth Amendment because it \\nwas her property, the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause is at issue as well. (U.S. Const. amend. V; \\namend. XIV, amend. VIII.) The taking of home equity \\nis clearly intended as a p unishment for nonpayment of \\ntaxes and inability to redeem the debt. As aging and \\nmental health issues are only increasing in America, it \\nis a vital question for all whether seizing the value of the whole property for the repayment of a lesser debt \\nis an excessive and abusive use of government power. \\n Homeownership is a precious goal that many \\nAmericans work hard to achieve. Faulting homeowners \\nfor not heeding warnings to redeem their debts through payment plans or re-purchase disrespectfully \\nignores many distressed homeowners' reality. Such \\nhomeowners often come to this position due to age, medical condition, loss of eyesight or other physical \\ndisability, mental impairment, the negligence of a care-\\ngiver, dishonesty of a relative, or simple lack of func-tional support. (Brief of Amicus Curiae AARP and \\n5 \\n AARP Foundation, March 30, 2021, Case No. 20-3730, \\nat pp. 7-8; Johnson v. City of East Orange, N.J.

City of New Bedford, Mass. Sup. Court for Bris-\\ntol County , No. 2273CV00243  [disabled retiree suffer-\\ning medical and financial problems].) There are also \\ncases of small, innocently miscalculated underpay-\\nments that turn into nightmares for homeowners and taxpayers alike. ( Perez v. County of Wayne, Mich. Cir. \\nCourt for County of Wayne , No. 19-009286-CZ  [$144 tax \\ndebt; county kept all $108,000 sales proceeds, 750 times the original debt]; Rafaeli, LLC v. Oakland \\nCounty (2020) 505 Mich. 429 [$8. 41 tax debt; county \\nkept all $24,500 sales proceeds, approximately 2,913 times the original debt].) Homeowners suffering from \\ndistress or mistake should not be disproportionally \\npunished by a total loss of  home equity\\u2014perhaps the \\nonly economic resource they have accrued\\u2014but should \\nbe provided a check for the remainder of what they \\nonce rightfully owned. It is a simple calculation and function of government to process such an incredible \\noverpayment. \\n Minnesota's tax windfall here is approximately \\n$25,000 in \\\"net proceeds\\\" from  the sale of Ms. Tyler's \\ncondominium to satisfy he r delinquent property tax \\nbill. ( Tyler v. Hennepin Cty ., 26 F.4th at pp. 790-791.) \\nThe extensive current and hi storical legal support for \\nthese proceeds belonging to Ms. Tyler is well set out \\nin the Petition for Certiorari and will not be repeated \\n6 \\n here, except to concur that relevant takings jurispru-\\ndence directly applies. ( Koontz v. St. Johns River Water \\nManagement Dist . (2013) 570 U.S. 595; Webb's Fabu-\\nlous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith  (1980) 449 U.S. 155.) \\n Minnesota's tax windfall at Ms. Tyler's expense \\nmust be reviewed. Amicus HJTA submits that the \\\"var-ious purposes\\\" of Minnesota Statute section 282.08 \\n(Tyler v. Hennepin Cty ., 26 F.4th at p.  791) are clearly \\nthe same purposes for which taxes are imposed and collected. Accordingly, Minnesota has created a tax \\nloophole for its own benefit at a vulnerable home-\\nowner's expense, a behavior that is repeated in many states as the Petition for Certiorari explains. Minne-\\nsota's claim to Ms. Tyler's $25,000 in home equity is \\neither a taking or an excessive punishment and any-thing else is fiction. Certior ari should be granted to \\nresolve the widespread problem afflicting American \\nhomeowners and the future of homeownership. \\n Even in states where the law recognizes a poten-\\ntial return of excess home equity, there is opportunity for government to under-prioritize the noticing proce-\\ndures and thereby increase the likelihood of taxing \\nauthorities quietly, passively retaining the funds that rightfully belong to the taxpayer. For example, in Cali-\\nfornia, proceeds are not automatically delivered, but \\nmust be claimed within one year. (Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7 4675(a).) Government bureaucracy can be slow or in-\\nefficient enough for notices to be misplaced or sent to \\nthe wrong address in that short time. Even when no-tices timely arrive at the right address, distressed for-\\nmer homeowners may\\u2014conveniently for California \\n7 \\n governments\\u2014not be in sufficient physical or mental \\ncondition to file a claim nor have the aid of someone \\nwho can. After one year with no claim filed, the prop-\\nerty belongs to the State of California, as it is in Min-\\nnesota. Clarity in this case would help California and \\nother states to clean up th eir tax collection laws to \\ncomport with the U.S. Constitution as it regards what is typically an American's most vital asset and symbol \\nof financial stability and prosperity: a home. \\n \\nB. Minnesota's tax windfall for county-\\nsupervised forest management, parks, \\nand general government services is de-\\nfinitively for \\\"public use\\\" and punishes Ms. Tyler for a lack of funds by taking significantly more than was owed. \\n Minnesota Statute section 282.08 would apportion \\nthe $25,000 \\\"net proceeds\\\" of the Tyler tax sale to for-\\nest development, county parks and recreation, and un-restricted general government services. In fact, section \\n282.08 is titled \\\" APPORTIONMENT OF PROCEEDS \\nTO TAXING DISTRICTS .\\\" It is indisputable that \\nmoney transferred to a taxing district is for \\\"public \\nuse\\\" under the Fifth Amendment. That is the only pur-\\npose of such districts. \\n Ms. Tyler's private property has been taken for \\n$25,000 worth of such public use, and similar incidents regularly occur across the country. Without review, \\ngovernments will continue to take tax windfalls out-\\nright, as Minnesota does by statute, or make room in \\n8 \\n statutes for clever designs or carelessness similarly ca-\\npable of producing unjustified windfalls at the expense \\nof the vulnerable. \\n Ms. Tyler did not have the money or the financial \\nsavvy to redeem the property , so the foreclosure pro-\\nceedings ensued. HJTA does not debate this. HJTA as-serts that Ms. Tyler's prope rty has been taken and she \\nhas been excessively punished for having no money or \\nability to redeem the property, a state of being that is \\nnot even a disobedient act, much less a crime. Never-\\ntheless she has been fined, and the amount of her fine \\nis undoubtedly extreme. With the $40,000 sale of her home, Ms. Tyler paid her $15,000 debt (inclusive of ex-\\nisting penalties and interest) nearly 3 times. Given the \\neveryday prevalence of homeownership, hardship, and government use of tax sales on real property to satisfy \\ndebt, the Court should grant certiorari to make clear \\nin all states what is th e minimum standard under the \\nTakings Clause and/or whether this is an impermissi-\\nble, excessive punishment for unpaid taxes. \\n \\nII. The California Le gislature maintains a \\nvariant of the problem, also taking prop-\\nerty for \\\"public use,\\\" and demonstrates no \\ninclination to correct it. \\n Although California is not part of the extensive \\nsplit of authority among states on the parallel issue to \\nMs. Tyler's, which immediately  speaks volumes as to \\nthe need for certiorari, California's tax sales statutes demonstrate a more subtle abuse of homeowners. As \\n9 \\n the Petition for Certiorari briefly explained, \\\"[Califor-\\nnia] law permits confiscation of the entire value when \\nmunicipalities claim the indebted property for a public \\nuse or economic revitalization.\\\" (Pet. at 31.) Without clarification on certiorari, California's laws taking \\nhome equity from vulnerable citizens will continue to \\nwreak havoc unchecked. \\n In California, a tax-defaulting homeowner gener-\\nally has one year to claim remaining home equity from a tax sale like the one Ms. Tyler's property underwent. \\n(Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7 4675(a).) When property is \\nsold at a tax auction, and a claim is filed, disbursement \\nof the excess funds proceeds as follows: \\n(A) First, to lienholders of record prior to the \\nrecordation of the tax deed to the purchaser in \\nthe order of their priority. \\n(B) Second, to any person with title of record \\nto all or any portion of the property prior to \\nthe recordation of the tax deed to the pur-chaser. \\n(Id. at 4675(e).) \\n Though far from perfect, this provision comports \\nmore with the Constitution than does the Minnesota law in this case. \\n But there is another Ca lifornia law which causes \\nhome equity theft like Minnesota's. Working with a \\nnonprofit organization, the st ate or a local government \\nmay file an \\\"objection\\\" with the county tax collector to stop the open-market sa le under section 4675 and \\n10 \\n redirect the sale to exclus ive no-bid proceedings un-\\nder another statutory scheme. (Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\n\\u00a7 3695.4.) The state or local government may do this \\nfor \\\"any property that is or may be needed for public use.\\\" ( Ibid.) A nonprofit organization may also file an \\n\\\"objection\\\" on its own to trigger such special proceed-\\nings by providing a written promise to sell or rent to low-income persons. (Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7 3695.5.) \\nIn these cases, not only are no proceeds returned to the \\nhomeowner, but the homeowner will not be able to claim their remaining home equity as they could have \\nwithin one year under section 4675 because it will be \\ntaken by design. Their remaining home equity is taken for \\\"public use\\\" by government, developers or nonprof-\\nits. (Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7 3695.4.) \\n This special procedure is known as a Chapter 8 \\nsale. (See Cal Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7\\u00a7 3771-3841.) The non-\\nprofit organization or government-partnered developer gains an exclusive agreement to purchase the property \\nfor just the total amount due to the government. ( Id. at \\n\\u00a7\\u00a7 3791.4; 3793.1.) This absorbs  the home equity be-\\ncause it is not an open-market sale. And home equity \\ninterests, similar to Ms. Tyler's, are taken for \\\"public \\nuse\\\" thereby. (Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7 3695.4.) This clearly demands Fifth Amendment review. \\n California legislators, however, are unmotivated to \\nbring these statutes into compliance with the Takings \\nClause or Excessive Fines Clause. On February 7, 2022, \\nAssembly Bill 1839 was introduced. AB1839 would have required that an open public auction occur before \\nany Chapter 8 sale, thus at minimum affording every \\n11 \\n defaulted homeowner one chance to recover their re-\\nmaining home equity. The California Association of \\nCounty Treasurers and Tax Collectors supported the \\nbill, and no one opposed. (Assem. Com. On Rev. and Tax., Analysis of Assem. Bill. No. 1839 (2021-2022 Reg. \\nSess.) as amended Mar. 22, 202 2, at p. 3, Hearing Date \\nApril 25, 2022.) \\n Unfortunately, AB1839 died in committee on April \\n26, 2022. What is worse, other legislation had been simultaneously proposed to expand  the definition of \\nan eligible nonprofit under the Chapter 8 sales pro-\\nceedings, thus intending to make home equity theft more likely. (Assem. Com. on Rev. and Tax., Analysis \\nof Assem. Bill No. 2021 (2021-2022 Reg. Sess.) as \\namended April 7, 2022, at p. 1, Hearing Date April 25, 2022 [\\\"Expands eligible uses for which a nonprofit or-\\nganization may object to a sale of tax-defaulted prop-\\nerty by public auction or sealed bid\\\"].) California, along with Minnesota and the many other states discussed \\nin the Petition for Certiorari,  sorely need application of \\nthe Takings Clause and Excessive Fines Clause to re-turn home equity proceeds to distressed homeowners \\nfollowing the sales of their homes to repay tax debts. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\n\",\n          \"IN THE \\nSupreme Court of the United States \\nCOINBASE , INC., \\nPetitioner, \\nv. \\nABRAHAM  BIELSKI , \\nRespondent. \\nCOINBASE , INC., \\nPetitioner, \\nv. \\nDAVID SUSKI, et al., \\nRespondents.\\nBRIEF OF THE DRI CENTER FOR LAW  \\nAND PUBLIC POLICY AS AMICUS CURIAE  \\nIN SUPPORT OF PETITIONER On Writ of Certiorari to  \\nthe United States Court of Appeals \\nfor the Ninth Circuit No. 22-105\\nSarah Elizabeth Spencer \\nCounsel of Record  \\nCHRISTENSEN  & J ENSEN , P.C. \\nCounsel for Amicus Curiae \\n257 East 200 South \\nSuite 1100 Salt Lake City, Utah 84111 801-323-5000 sarah.spencer@chrisjen.comDRI C\\nENTER  FOR LAW  \\nAND PUBLIC  POLICY  \\n222 South Riverside Plaza Suite 1870 Chicago, Illinois  60606 312-698-6210 >>>>\\nJanuary 27, 2023\\ni \\nTABLE OF CONTENTS  \\nPage\\nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES  ...........................  ii \\nINTEREST OF THE AMICUS CURIAE ........  1 \\nINTRODUCTION AND  \\nSUMMARY  OF ARGUMENT  ...................  2 \\nARGUMENT  ................................ ..................  7 \\nI.

This en-\\nsures arbitration achieves its basic purpose of \\nresol ving disputes efficie ntly, predictably, and at \\nminimal cost. In support of those goals, The Center \\nsubmits this brief in support of Petitioner Coin-\\nbase, Inc., arguing that the decision of the Ninth \\nCircuit countenancing the district court's discretion \\nto deny a stay of litigat ion pending interlocutory \\nappeal should be reversed and its opinion vacated.  \\nINTRODUCTION AND  \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT  \\nAn interlocutory appeal under Section 16(a) of \\nthe Federal Arbi tration Act addresses  the thresh-\\nold question of arbitrability. This Court should hold \\nthat such an appeal divests the district court of ju-\\nrisdiction and requires a mandatory stay of all liti-\\ngation.  \\nArbitration and litigation are distinct mecha-\\nnisms of dis pute resolution. They  cannot coexist. \\nParties choose arbitration to avoid litigation. Once \\na party has been forced to litigate, this purpose is \\ndestroyed. The loud, resonating bell of litigation, \\nonce heard by all, cannot be un -rung.3 Its course \\n \\n 3 Levin v. Alms & Assocs., I nc., 634  F.3d 260, 265 (4th \\nCir. 2011).  \\n3 \\nand its ef fects remain even if an appellate court re-\\nverses. Parties who litigate will suffer the conse-\\nquences, whatever they may be.  \\nThe Ninth Circuit (along with the Second and \\nFifth Circuits) has adopted an untenable rule that \\nwill adversely impact the bargained -for rights of \\nmillion s of American businesses and individuals \\nwho are parties to arbitration agreements in many \\ndiverse industries and contexts. Since the 1990s, \\nthe use of arbitration clauses in consumer, em-\\nployment, and commercial contracts has increased .   \\nGiven the prolife ration of arbitration, the Ninth \\nCircuit's holding goes far beyond affecting business \\ninterests. Recent scholarship explains an effort by \\nplaintiff -claimants and their sophisticated attor-\\nneys to seize upon arbitration provisions in com-\\nmonplace consumer agr eements. Those claimants \\nseek to \\\"turn the tables\\\" on business interests by \\nusing arbitration agreements to file mass arbitra-\\ntions strategically intended to overwhelm and dis-\\nrupt the operations of their opponents. Put simply, \\nthis issu e affects a significa nt number of U.S. peo-\\nple and businesses and is not unique to businesses.  \\nThere are valid reasons why parties prefer arbi-\\ntration. Like Petitioner Coinbase, Inc., a party who \\nbargains for arbitration may seek streamlined, \\nfaster procedur es; control (such as input on the de-\\ncisionmaker); limitations on invasive and costly  \\ninter -party, third -party, and expert discovery; add-\\ned protections for confidential information; less  \\nadversarial and more collaborative adjudications; \\n4 \\nand final resoluti ons without the risk of protracted \\nappeal.  \\nCivil lawsuits in federal court, by contrast, are \\nnot as predictable. Litigation comes with broad dis-\\ncovery and unpredictable delay. Positions are \\nstaked out early on as one side or the other scores \\nwins in pretri al motions and deposi tions held long \\nbefore trial. Cases are more easily won on technical \\nvictories. No one person has any final say about \\nhow a lawsuit will take its course. Any given law-\\nsuit has a life of its own, often experiencing a form \\nof self -propel led but uncontrolled mom entum.  \\nThere are ripple effects. These costs of litigation \\npersist even if an appeal is won and a case is trans-\\nferred to arbitration after a period of forced litiga-\\ntion. This includes direct costs such as attorney \\nfees, expert fees , and litigation expe nses. There are \\nalso indirect costs. Indirect costs include disposi-\\ntive changes to the probable substantive outcome \\nresulting from, for example, damning discovery dis-\\nclosures, dismissals for technicalities, and pretrial \\nrulings that ch ange the course, tone , and tenor of \\nthe case \\u2014all of which might not have happened in \\narbitration.  \\nThe minority position says these concerns beg \\nthe question. After all, a defendant who loses on \\nappeal had no right to arbitrate to begin with and \\nthat defen dant has already lost  once. If the appel-\\nlate court affirms, then the plaintiff will be preju-\\ndiced by having to wait. That may be. But a \\nplaintiff who is asked to hold tight \\u2014and to wait on-\\n5 \\nly for the time it takes to have an appeal decided \\u2014\\ndoes not suffer th e same risk of harm. Delay is not \\nlike the permanent, possibly irreparable harm as-\\nsociated with discovery, case dynamics, and party \\npositioning in civil litigation undertaken while a \\ncase is on appeal on the issue of arbitrability.  \\nA defendant seeking  an interlocutory appeal  \\nunder Section 16(a) of the FAA is asking for protec-\\ntion from the permanent and un -windable litiga-\\ntion process (which it argues it contracted to avoid) \\nduring the limited time when arbitrability is an \\nopen question. Such a defendan t is not asking to \\narbitrate the dispute in the face of a loss, while on \\nappeal. Delay alone does not outweigh the pre-\\nsumptive prejudice to the party seeking to enforce \\narbitration. Where the very function of arbitration \\nis to avoid litigation and where th e issue on appeal \\nis whether litigation can proceed, the defendant \\nshould not have to bear the burden and costs of lit-\\nigation before that question is finally determined.  \\nThis conclusion is buttressed by the differences \\nin reversal rates between appeals fr om denials of \\narbitration as compared to appeals in civil cases as \\na whole. Scholars observe that circuit courts re-\\nversed approximately half of cases involving deni-\\nals of arbitration (as compared to a mere 10 to 20% \\nof civil cases as a whole, depending on the year ex-\\namined). This statistic is no surprise, however, as \\nit accords with the strong legislative policy in favor \\nof arbitration. This policy would predictably gener-\\nate more reversals of denials of arbitration.   \\n6 \\nThe majority rule better serves the rel evant in-\\nterests of both individuals/consumers and busi-\\nnesses. Further, a clear, bright -line rule better \\nserves the liberal federal public policy favoring ar-\\nbitration and federal court judicial economy. The \\nautomatic stay rule and the divestiture principle \\nare such rules. They promote judicial economy by \\nfreeing up district court resources while cases are \\non appeal and by preventing needless expenditure \\nof district court resources on litigating applications \\nfor discretionary stay. These principles promote \\nconsistency of rulings between trial and appellate \\ncourts. They also advance the form and structure of \\nthe federal civil justice system with its unique \\nfunctions of district and appellate courts.  \\nThe Ninth Circuit got it wrong when it held that \\na district c ourt retains jurisdiction to proceed with \\nlitigation despite a non -frivolous appeal of the de-\\nnial of a motion to compel arbitration. The Third, \\nFourth, Seventh, Tenth, Eleventh, and D.C. Cir-\\ncuits decided the issue correctly when they found \\nthat an interloc utory appeal under Section 16(a) of \\nthe Federal Arbitration Act automatically divests \\nthe district court of jurisdiction and requires a \\ncomplete stay of all litigation. The Ninth Circuit \\nshould be reversed. Its opinion should be vacated.  \\n7 \\nARGUMENT  \\nI. Strong, well -established federal policy \\nliberally favors arbitration.  \\nThe Federal Arbitration Act (\\\"FAA\\\") was passed \\nin 1925. Its goal wa s \\\"to reverse the longstanding \\njudicial hostility to arbitration agreements.\\\"4 It al-\\nso sought \\\"to place arbitration agreements 'upon \\nthe same footing as other contracts.' \\\"5 The FAA \\nembodies a \\\"liberal federal policy favoring arbitra-\\ntion.\\\"6 \\\"The  overarching pur pose of the FAA . . . . \\nis to ensure the enforcement of arbitration agree-\\nments according to their terms so as to facilitate \\nstreamlined proceedings.\\\"7  \\n \\n 4 Gilmer v.

No principle compels \\nsuch an anomalous result, and this Court should not \\ncreate an Article III except ion that excludes nominal-\\ndamages awards from ordinary justiciability rules. \\nThe officials do not contest that their actions \\ncaused Chike and Joseph real injury. Their argument is that nominal damages do not redress past injuries. \\nBut nominal damages vindic ate constitutional viola-\\ntions, including where the harm is not quantifiable. \\nMemphis Cmty. Sch. Dist. v. Stachura , 477 U.S. 299, \\n308 n.11 (1986) (quoting Carey v. Piphus , 435 U.S. \\n247, 266 (1978)). And contrary to the Eleventh Circuit's belief, they do so \\\"for the plaintiff's benefit.\\\" \\nFarrar v. Hobby , 506 U.S. 103, 113 (1992). Those \\nprinciples, common-law history, and common sense all show that a nominal-damages award provides a \\npersonal, tangible benefit that redresses a plaintiff's \\ninjury. Article III requires nothing more. \\nProviding a remedy to plaintiffs like Chike and \\nJoseph has neither flooded the courts with lawsuits \\nnor bankrupted officials in the many circuits that \\nallow standalone nominal-damages awards. Nominal \\ndamages, like compensato ry damages, have \\\"coex-\\nisted with our constitutional system since the dawn of the Republic.\\\" Tanzin v. Tanvir , __ S. Ct. __, 2020 WL \\n7250100, at 5 (Dec. 10, 2020). And a nation of laws \\nrequires  a way for courts to make things right when \\nofficials violate rights. Because nominal-damages claims satisfy Arti cle III, this Court should reverse. \\n2 \\nREPLY ARGUMENT  \\nI. T h i s  C o u r t  s h o u l d  d e c l i n e  t o  c r e a t e  a n  \\nArticle III exception that excludes nominal-\\ndamages awards from ordinary justicia-\\nbility rules. \\nThe officials do not deny that Chike and Joseph \\nsuffered a concrete injury-in-fact, nor do they deny \\ncausation. Their only objection is redressability. In making that objection, they confuse redressability \\nwith quantifiability . Because nominal damages \\nvindicate past legal violations, Chike and Joseph's nominal-damages claims s atisfy Article III and are \\nnot moot. \\nA. Nominal damages redress past constitu-\\ntional injury. \\nArticle III standing requires  a plaintiff to show he \\nhas suffered (1) a concrete and particularized injury-\\nin-fact, (2) caused by the defendant, (3) that is likely \\nto be redressed by a favorable court ruling. Spokeo, \\nInc. v. Robins , 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016). The \\nofficials do not dispute injury or causation. And \\nredressability requires only that a plaintiff personally \\n\\\"benefit in a tangible way from\\\" court intervention. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't , 523 U.S. 83, \\n103 n.5 (1998) (quotation omitted). A plaintiff \\nsatisfies that test by showing that a court order would \\n\\\"partially redress\\\" his injury. Meese v. Keene , 481 U.S. \\n465, 476 (1987). Nominal-damages awards, though \\nsmall, satisfy that standard.\\n1 \\n \\n1 The officials articulate a second redressability requirement: \\nthat the relief \\\"target and redress the plaintiff's asserted injury\\\" \\nrather than someone else's. Resp.Br.12. But that is no different \\nthan requiring that the remedy \\\"personally\\\" benefit the plaintiff. \\n3 \\nThe officials confuse redressability with quanti-\\nfiability. Consider a studen t who shared her faith on \\ncampus by chalking messages about Jesus Christ on \\nthe sidewalk, only to see a professor direct his class to erase them.\\n2 Even if the officials modified their \\npolicies to prevent this First Amendment violation \\nfrom happening again, the officials admit that this student could litigate to final judgment her 1\\u00a2 \\ncompensatory-damages claim for the consumed chalk. \\nEven a single penny of relief partially benefits the stu-dent personally and in a tangible way. \\nNow consider Chike. The officials do not dispute \\nhe was injured when they twice stopped him from speaking. The problem is that he cannot monetize the \\nlost speech's value. But Chike's lost speech is far more \\nvaluable than the consumed chalk. And it is the lost \\nspeech that gives Chike the right to seek judicial \\nredress; the $1 in nominal damages that officials \\nmust pay Chike is no less a partial redress that personally and tangibly benefits him than is the \\npenny that redresses the chalk user. A nominal-\\ndamages award \\\"modifies th e defendant's behavior \\nfor the plaintiff's benefit by forcing the defendant to \\npay an amount of money he otherwise would not pay.\\\" \\nFarrar , 506 U.S. at 113. And in this way, the payment \\nof nominal damages \\\"materially alters\\\" the parties' \\nlegal relationship, id. at 111\\u201312, in the same way as \\na modest compensatory-damages award. \\n \\n \\n2 Compare with Fresno State Students for Life  v. Thatcher , No. \\n1:17-at-00382 (E.D. Cal.), available at https://perma.cc/566E-\\n6EBZ. . \\n4 \\nThe officials say that whil e one dollar in compen-\\nsatory damages redresses a past injury, one dollar in \\nnominal damages does not. Resp.Br.17\\u201319. Again, \\nthis is confusion over quantifiability. Contra City of \\nRiverside v. Rivera , 477 U.S. 561, 574 (1986) \\n(plaintiff's vindication of \\\"important civil and \\nconstitutional rights that cannot be valued solely in monetary terms\\\"). Courts  award nominal damages \\nprimarily when there has been an \\\"infraction of a \\nlegal right\\\" but the \\\"extent of loss is not shown.\\\" C\\nHARLES T. MCCORMICK , HANDBOOK ON THE LAW OF \\nDAMAGES  \\u00a7 20 at 85 (1935). So it's not that nominal \\ndamages offer \\\" zero legally recognized relief for a past \\ninjury,\\\" Resp.Br.19 (emphasis added), it's that they \\noffer partial relief. Skyline Wesleyan Church v. Cal. \\nDep't of Managed Health Care , 968 F.3d 738, 749 (9th \\nCir. 2020) (\\\"Nominal damages would redress \\nSkyline's injury, even if only to a minimal extent.\\\"). \\nAnd because nominal dama ges \\\"materially alter[  ]\\\" \\nthe parties' relationship, Farrar , 506 U.S. at 111\\u201312, \\nthat is sufficient for Article III. Meese , 481 U.S. at 476. \\n\\\"Nothing more is needed to establish redressability.\\\" Skyline , 968 F.3d at 749. Otherwise, justiciability of \\nidentical claims turns on mere semantics. ACLU Br. \\n11\\u201312 (discussing Freenor v. Mayor & Alderman of \\nSavannah , No. CV414-247, 2019 WL 9936663 (S.D. \\nGa. May 20, 2019)). \\nAs this Court intimated in Carey , nominal dam-\\nages make a constitutional deprivation \\\"actionable.\\\" \\n435 U.S. at 266. That is because they redress a plain-\\ntiff's concrete and particula rized injury in a personal, \\ntangible way. U.S.Br.17\\u201319 (same result if Congress \\nauthorized a minimum $1,000 award for First \\nAmendment violations). A nominal-damages award partially redresses a loss of incalculable value. \\n5 \\nB. This Court's decisions confirm that \\nnominal damages' primary purpose is \\npast redress of valuable\\u2014even \\npriceless\\u2014rights. \\nNominal damages\\u2014like other remedies\\u2014have \\nmultiple effects that can include the declaration of \\nrights or the protection of prospective rights. But this \\nCourt's precedents and numerous lower-court \\ndecisions show that nominal damages' primary \\npurpose is to redress past legal violations. \\nCarey  decided that nominal damages, rather than \\npresumed damages, were the appropriate award for \\nconstitutional violations where harm cannot be mon-etized. 435 U.S. at 266. But the context was not \\\"pro-\\nspective redress.\\\" Contra Resp.Br.24. It was about \\nremedying a past \\\"deprivation\\\" of rights. 435 U.S. at \\n266. That is why the Court did not speak in terms of \\nany \\\"prospective\\\" due-process problem but to the past \\n\\\"denial of procedur al due process.\\\" Ibid. Accord, e.g., \\nStachura , 477 U.S. at 308 & n.11 (same point in free-\\nspeech context); Arizonans for Official English v. \\nArizona , 520 U.S. 43, 69 & n.24 (1997) (contrasting \\nnominal damages and injunctive relief). \\nLikewise, in Farrar , the plaintiff dropped a claim \\nfor injunctive relief and pursued only an unsuccessful compensatory-damages claim.  506 U.S. at 106. In \\ndetermining that a nominal-damages award made the \\nplaintiff a prevailing party under \\u00a7  1983, this Court \\nemphasized that \\\" Carey  obligates a court to award \\nnominal damages when a plaintiff establishes the \\nviolation of his [constitutional] right.\\\" Id. at 112. That \\nis, this Court correctly saw the award of nominal \\ndamages as retrospective redress, not prospective \\nprotection. \\n6 \\nUnsurprisingly, lower courts have consistently \\nrelied on this Court's cases to hold that a plaintiff \\nwhose constitutional rights have been violated \\n\\\"should not lose his right to proceed\\\" if \\\"only nominal damages are at stake.\\\" Amato v. City of Saratoga \\nSprings , 170 F.3d 311, 319 (2d Cir. 1999) (discussing \\nCarey ). Petitioners' opening brief discussed many \\nsuch cases. Pet.Br.27\\u201328. Yet the officials fail to \\nrespond to many. There are more examples, in count-\\nless settings. E.g., ACLU Br. 13\\u201319; Found. for \\nIndividual Rights in Educ. [FIRE] Br. 5\\u20139; Becket Fund Br. 20\\u201325; Pacific Legal Found. Br. 1\\u20134, 12\\u201316.  \\nThe officials' rule also vi olates this Court's prece-\\ndent in analogous contexts. For example, the officials \\ninsist that statutory damages are \\\"different in kind\\\" \\nbecause they \\\"do not signify nothing .\\\" Resp.Br.19\\u201320. \\nBut statutory and nominal damages serve the same \\npurpose: providing \\\"recompense for injury\\\" where \\n\\\"the rules of law render diff icult or impossible proof of \\ndamages.\\\" Douglas v. Cunningham , 294 U.S. 207, 209 \\n(1935). The officials concede that it \\\"is good enough \\nfor Article III\\\" when Congre ss sets statutory damages \\nwhere it \\\"might be hard to measure\\\" actual damages. \\nResp.Br.19\\u201320. It is no different when courts award \\nnominal damages for the same reason. \\nThe same is true of liquidated damages, which \\nassign a fixed value to harm where actual damages \\n\\\"may be difficult or impossible to ascertain.\\\" Rex \\nTrailer Co. v. United States , 350 U.S. 148, 153\\u201354 \\n(1956). And punitive dama ges are non-compensatory \\nand sometimes awarded without compensatory harm. U.S.Br.19\\u201320. Yet the offici als do not dispute that a \\nplaintiff with a standalone claim for statutory, \\nliquidated, or punitive da mages has failed to present \\nan Article III case or controversy. \\n7 \\nThe officials criticize Chike and Joseph for \\nequating \\\"vindication\\\" of rights with Article III \\nredress. Resp.Br.21\\u201323. But where \\\"there has been a \\nviolation of a right, the person injured is entitled to an action. If he is entitled to an action, he is entitled \\nat least to nominal damages,  or else he would not be \\nentitled to a recovery.\\\" Parker v. Griswold , 17 Conn. \\n288, 303 (1846). \\nC. At common law, courts routinely award-\\ned standalone nominal damages solely to redress past injuries. \\nNo one disputes that English and American \\ncommon-law courts consistently adjudicated claims for nominal damages in a wide array of cases, and \\nthat such claims arose from a past violation of rights. \\nYet the officials insist that when common-law courts \\ndid award nominal damages, it was only for \\ncontinuing or threatened injuries. Resp.Br.28\\u201340. \\nCenturies of cases debunk this theory. \\nFor one thing, the officials concede that entire cat-\\negories of common-law cases involved the award of \\nnominal damages even \\\"whe n they would not plainly \\nserve as prospective relief.\\\" Id. at 34. These include \\ncases (like this one) when the plaintiff \\\"proved a legal \\nviolation\\\" but failed to establish or quantify compensatory damages, ibid. , \\\"as a vehicle for costs,\\\" \\nid. at 32\\u201334, or for \\\"dignitary harms,\\\" id. at 38. And \\nthese categories of cases\\u2014which alone undermine the officials' historical analysis\\u2014are just a few examples. \\nEnglish courts inferred nominal damages when-\\never the plaintiff establish ed an invasion of a legal \\nright, no matter if ther e was a continuing or \\nthreatened injury. \\\"[I]njury imports a damage, \\nthough it does not cost the party one farthing.\\\" Ashby  \\n8 \\nv. White , 92 Eng. Rep. 126, 137 (1703) (Holt, J.). \\nCourts \\\"import[ed] a dama ge\\\" for various claims, \\nincluding breach of contract, trespass, and personal \\ninjury. Ibid.  (\\\"a cuff on the ear\\\" would be actionable \\n\\\"for it is a personal injury\\\").  \\nFor personal rights, nominal damages served to \\nremedy past harms, not to  protect against future \\ninjury. In Ashby , for example, the House of Lords held \\nthat an elector who was wrongfully turned away from \\nthe polls by an official could sue without proving the \\\"possibility of a future profi t\\\" or the \\\"possibility of a \\nfuture\\\" damage. 87 Eng. Rep. 810, 810, 813 (1703) \\n(Powell, J., & Gould, J.). Often these violations occurred when an official fa iled to perform his duty \\nbut cured the defect before suit. In these cases, plain-\\ntiffs could still recover nominal damages for the past \\ninjury even though they had no need for prospective \\nrelief. E.g., Barker v. Green , 130 Eng. Rep. 327, 327 \\n(1824) (sheriff's one-day delay in arrest on writ); Bales \\nv. Wingfield , 4 Q.B. 580, n. (multi-week delay by \\nsheriff in executing a lien writ); Clifton  v. Hooper , 115 \\nEng. Rep. 175, 175, 178 (1844) (sheriff delay in exe-cuting process). This was al so true for actions brought \\nagainst private citizens. E.g., Marzetti v. Williams , \\n109 Eng. Rep. 842, 845\\u201347 (1830) (one-day delay in issuing check); Godefroy  v. Jay, 131 Eng. Rep. 159, \\n159\\u201362 (1831) (client could receive nominal damages \\nfor attorney's negligence). \\nAmerican courts followed suit. Plaintiffs could \\nrecover at least nominal damages for injuries caused \\nby public officials without showing the threat of future harm. E.g.,  Mickles v. Hart , 1 Denio 548, 550 \\n(N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1845) (sheriff deputy's delay in \\nexecuting debt); Laflin v. Willard , 33 Mass. 64, 67 \\n(1835) (same); Waterhouse v. Waite , 11 Mass. 207, 210 \\n9 \\n(1814) (same); Burns v. Erben , 26 How. Pr. 273, 277 \\n(N.Y. Super. Ct. 1864) (false imprisonment); Doherty  \\nv. Munson , 127 Mass. 495, 496 (1879) (detention \\nunder illegal warrant). And American courts routinely awarded nominal damages in private \\nactions when such an award could provide no \\nprospective relief. E.g., Thompson  v. New Orleans, J. \\n& G.N.R. Co. , 50 Miss. 315, 320 (1874) (train \\nconductor passed passenger's stop by two miles); \\nCrosby v. Humphreys , 60 N.W. 843, 844 (Minn. 1894) \\n(assault); Young v. W. Union Tel. Co. , 11 S.E. 1044, \\n1044\\u201345 (N.C. 1890) (negligent delay in delivering \\ntelegraph); McKim  v. Bartlett , 129 Mass. 226, 229 \\n(1880) (estate administrator liable for at least nomi-nal damages after court discharged future liability).  \\nThis partial list shows that early American \\ncourts\\u2014like their English counterparts\\u2014undeniably \\nawarded nominal damages so lely for past injuries. \\nAccord, e.g., U.S.Br.10\\u201311; Nat'l Right to Work Legal \\nDef. Found. Br. 4\\u201310. \\nEven a nominal-damages award in a trespass, \\nriparian-rights, or other pr operty case was intended, \\nfirst and foremost, to vindicate the past \\\"violation of \\nthe plaintiff's right.\\\" Delaware & Hudson Canal Co.  \\nv. Torrey , 33 Pa. 143, 148 (1859); accord Embrey v. \\nOwen , 155 Eng. Rep. 579, 585 (1851) (same). And that \\nis why common-law courts awarded nominal damages \\nin property cases even when the parties' future rights \\nand obligations were not at stake. E.g., Hefley  v. \\nBaker , 19 Kan. 9, 11 (1877) (pure trespass case with \\nno property-line dispute); Curtis v. Paggett , 27 P. 109, \\n109\\u201310 (Kan. 1891) (same); Cook v. Loomis , 26 Conn. \\n483, 486 (1857) (trover case where property already \\nreturned); Mears v. Cornwall , 40 N.W. 931, 932\\u201334 \\n(Mich. 1888) (same); Warder v. Baldwin , 8 N.W. 257, \\n10 \\n258 (Wis. 1881) (same); Moon v. Raphael , 132 Eng. \\nRep. 122, 122 (1835) (same). And plaintiffs at common \\nlaw could waive their right to compensatory damages \\nand choose to seek nominal damages alone. Pet.Br.42; \\naccord Daniels v. Bates , 2 Greene 151, 152 (Iowa \\n1849); Pastorius v. Fisher , 1 Rawle 27, 29 (Pa. 1828). \\nThe officials' failure to address so many of these \\ncases is no mere oversight. Many are on all fours with \\nthe constitutional violations at issue here and \\nestablish the common-law ru le that nominal damages \\nsupport a claim for past constitutional violations. So \\ndo cases involving intentional torts. Frederick \\nDouglass Found. Br. 6\\u20138 (c omparing Petitioners' \\ninjuries to those caused by intentional torts, for which \\ncourts awarded nominal damages); Stachura , 477 \\nU.S. at 306 (level of \\u00a7  1983 damages \\\"determined \\naccording to principles de rived from the common law \\nof torts\\\"). \\nThe officials say that, even if common-law courts \\nawarded nominal damages with no \\\"prospective \\nremedial benefits,\\\" such awards were meaningless \\nand insufficient \\\"for maintaining an action.\\\" Resp.Br.35\\u201336. But as detailed above, countless cases \\nheld that a standalone nominal-damages claim \\nsustained a case having no effect on future rights. It would be passing strange for so many courts, over so \\nmany years, to adjudicate  nominal-damages claims \\nthat they thought served no purpose and, in the officials' view, violated redressability requirements. \\nFinally, while early common-law courts may have \\nbeen unwilling to reverse a trial court's failure to award nominal damages in trifling or frivolous cases, \\nResp.Br.34\\u201335; Fleming  v. Gilbert , 3 Johns 528, 532 \\n(N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1808); Robertson v. Gentry , 5 Ky. 542, \\n11 \\n543 (Ct. App. 1812), that reluctance faded when \\n\\\"important\\\" rights were at stake. Blackburn v. Ala. \\nGreat S. R. Co. , 39 So. 345, 346 (Ala. 1905); Hecht  v. \\nHarrison , 40 P. 306, 309\\u201310 (Wyo. 1895). Modern \\ncourts view nominal damages the same way when a \\nplaintiff alleges a constitutional violation. E.g., Risdal \\nv. Halford , 209 F.3d 1071, 1073 (8th Cir. 2000) \\n(reversing for plain error because the district court \\nfailed to instruct the jury  to award nominal damages \\nif it found a free-speech violation); Zok v. State , 903 \\nP.2d 574, 579 (Alaska 1995) (failure to award nominal \\ndamages for unlawful arrest was plain error because \\nthe \\\"right to be free from unlawful confinement is sufficiently important and fundamental in our \\nsociety\\\"). Indeed, circuit co urts uniformly hold that an \\naward of nominal damages is mandatory upon \\nproving a constitutional violation. Pet.Br.30\\u201331 n.4 \\n(collecting cases). The officials' cramped theory of \\nnominal damages cannot explain away this history. \\nD. Nominal damages are not a mere \\nanalogue for declaratory relief. \\nNominal damages' primary purpose is to redress \\na past injury. Yet the officials continue to assert that \\n\\\"[d]eclaratory judgments are the analogue,\\\" \\nResp.Br.41, unless sovereign or qualified immunity is at stake, in which case th e officials feel differently, id. \\nat 42 n.3. The officials are incorrect. U.S.Br.23\\u201327. \\nTo be sure, \\\"all judgments of courts declare jural \\nrelations.\\\" Edwin M. Borchard, The Declaratory \\nJudgment\\u2014A Needed Procedural Reform , 28 Y\\nALE \\nL.J. 1, 4 (1918). Yet courts do not equate all forms of \\nrelief with declaratory judgments just because they share this one trait. \\n12 \\nNor do the officials rebut the many other differ-\\nences between declaratory judgments and nominal \\ndamages that unravel their flawed analogy. First, \\nnominal damages are legal relief, while declaratory judgments are equitable. Resp.Br.42 n.3. Second, \\ndeclaratory judgments were designed to determine \\nlegal rights \\\" before breach .\\\" Edwin M. Borchard, The \\nUniform Act on Declaratory Judgments , 34 H\\nARV. L. \\nREV. 697, 707 (1921). Nominal damages remedy past \\nharm, unavailable until an injury has occurred. C\\nHARLES T. MCCORMICK , HANDBOOK ON THE LAW OF \\nDAMAGES  \\u00a7 20 at 85 (1935) (\\\"Nominal damages are \\nawarded for the infraction of a legal right.\\\"). \\nThird, declaratory judgments are primarily \\nprospective relief, Christian Legal Soc'y v. Martinez , \\n561 U.S. 661, 676 n.6 (2010), while nominal damages, \\nwhich require a past violation, are primarily retro-\\nspective, Arizonans for Official English , 520 U.S. at \\n69 & n.24.   Fourth, the Declaratory Judgment Act \\n\\\"confers a discretion  on the courts,\\\" not an \\\"absolute \\nright upon the litigant.\\\" Wilton v. Seven Falls Co. , 515 \\nU.S. 277, 287 (1995). Nominal damages are manda-tory. Farrar , 506 U.S. at 112 (\\\" Carey obligate[d] a \\ncourt to award nominal damages when a plaintiff \\nestablishes the violation of his right\\\"). And finally, \\nunlike declaratory judgments,  courts have held that \\nnominal damages are subject to sovereign- and \\nqualified-immunity defenses. E.g., Am. Civil Liberties \\nUnion v. U.S. Conf. of Cath. Bishops , 705 F.3d 44, 53 \\nn.7 (1st Cir. 2013) (sovereign immunity); Hopkins v. \\nSaunders , 199 F.3d 968, 978 (8th Cir. 1999) (qualified \\nimmunity). \\nIn sum, the disparities between declaratory judg-\\nments and nominal damages are stark. And rightly \\nso, as their primary purpose is decidedly different. \\n13 \\nE. The officials' view of nominal damages \\ncontradicts Article III requirements. \\nRationalizing some of the many instances in \\nwhich common-law courts awarded nominal damages \\nfor the past violation of rights, the officials argue that \\nthe \\\"jurisdictional hook\\\" is \\\"the plaintiff's live claim \\nfor compensatory damages.\\\" Resp.Br.26. This hook saves a nominal-damages claim from mootness, say \\nthe officials, even if the plaintiff's compensatory-\\ndamages claim fail s on the merits. Ibid.  That \\nreasoning cannot be right. \\nTo begin, \\\"a plaintiff must demonstrate standing \\nfor each claim he seeks to press and for each form of relief that is sought.\\\" Town of Chester v. Laroe Ests., \\nInc., 137 S. Ct. 1645, 1650 (2017) (citation omitted). It \\nis impossible for a compensatory-damage remedy to \\nbe a \\\"jurisdictional hook\\\" for a separate, moot remedy. \\nA nominal-damages remedy mu st (and does) stand on \\nits own merits from the case's inception. \\nIn addition, \\\"an actual controversy must be extant \\nat all stages of review, not merely at the time the com-\\nplaint is filed.\\\" Arizonans for Official English , 520 \\nU.S. at 67 (citation omitted). Once a plausible claim \\nfor compensatory damages fail s at the merits stage, it \\nis again impossible for that claim to be a \\\"jurisdictional hook\\\" for a separate, moot claim. \\nMoreover, a plaintiff must quantify injury to \\nclaim compensatory damage s. Yet the loss of First \\nAmendment freedoms like speech and religious \\nexercise constitutes \\\"irreparable injury.\\\" Roman \\nCatholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , __ S. Ct. __, \\n2020 WL 6948354, at 3 (Nov. 25, 2020). Such injury \\n\\\"cannot be adequately measured or compensated by \\nmoney.\\\" Irreparable Injury , B\\nLACK 'S LAW DICTIONARY  \\n14 \\n(11th ed. 2019). The officials' position would lead to \\nthe indefensible result that the appropriate remedy \\nfor a past violation of rights is one that in some cases \\nwill not be available. \\nFinally, the officials' position deprives some \\nvictims of government misconduct of any remedy. The \\nofficials say that without plausible compensatory-damages remedies, plaintiffs can still \\\"vindicate their \\nrights through claims for prospective relief like \\ninjunctions and declaratory judgments.\\\" Resp.Br.46\\u201348. But that only underscor es the correctness of Chike \\nand Joseph's position: that eliminating the nominal-\\ndamages remedy would allo w officials to make a \\nstrategic post-filing change in policy solely to moot \\nprospective relief. Such a risk is real because \\ngovernment officials have strong incentives to moot \\ncases. Becket Fund Br. 8\\u201314; Joseph C. Davis & \\nNicholas R. Reaves, The Point Isn't Moot: How Lower \\nCourts Have Blessed Go vernment Abuse of the \\nVoluntary-Cessation Doctrine , 129 Y\\nALE L.J.  FORUM  \\n325 (2019). The officials propose a phantom remedy to \\ninsulate their unconstitutional acts from legal accountability. \\n  \\n15 \\nII. The officials' reasons for creating a nominal-\\ndamages exception to Article III are indefensible. \\nThe officials predict dire  effects if this Court \\nallows partial redress for the violation of Chike and \\nJoseph's rights. Yet it ha s been \\\"widely recognized\\\" \\nfor ages \\\"that a claim for nominal damages precludes mootness\\\" based on later events. N.Y. State Rifle & \\nPistol Ass'n v. City of N.Y. , 140 S. Ct. 1525, 1536 \\n(2020) (Alito, J., dissenting); Pet.Br.14 n.2 (catalog-uing eight circuits' rule). None of these asserted \\nconsequences have material ized in the jurisdictions \\nthat have rejected the Eleventh Circuit's novel and indefensible approach. The officials' arguments lack \\nmerit. \\nA. The majority rule does not require \\nadvisory opinions. \\nThe officials say that nominal-damages claims \\ninvite advisory opinions. Resp.Br. 2, 9\\u201310, 22, 41\\u201342. Not so. To quote the officials' own cases, advisory opinions \\\"advis[e] what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.\\\" Aetna Life Ins. Co. of \\nHartford v. Haworth , 300 U.S. 227, 241 (1937). \\nAccord, e.g., Preiser v. Newkirk , 422 U.S. 395, 401 \\n(1975) (same);  Ashcroft v. Mattis , 431 U.S. 171, 172 \\n(1977) (per curiam). That's not the request here. \\nChike and Joseph present real-world facts and \\n\\\"concrete legal issues, presented in [an] actual case[  ],\\\" \\nGolden v. Zwickler , 394 U.S. 103, 108 (1969): whether \\nofficials violated their free -speech rights. It is not \\nclear why the officials believe that question is more hypothetical here than if Chike's speech had con-sumed 1\\u00a2 of chalk, particularly when the officials do \\n16 \\nnot contest he suffered a cognizable injury-in-fact. \\nThere is nothing advisory about deciding the question \\nand awarding nominal damages. Young Ams. for \\nLiberty Br. 12; Christia n Legal Soc'y Br. 5\\u20136. \\nB. The majority rule does not eliminate the \\nmootness doctrine. \\nThe longstanding majority rule has not \\\"swal-\\nlowed\\\" the mootness doctrine in the eight circuits that \\nfollow it. Contra Resp.Br.43\\u201345. Many constitutional \\ncases seek only prospectiv e relief, either because \\ndamages are barred by sovereign immunity or because the injury is threatened or imminent but has not yet occurred at the time of filing. The mootness doctrine is alive and well for those cases. The \\nsituation here\\u2014where the officials already violated \\nChike's and Joseph's constitutional rights\\u2014presents \\nthe flip side of mootness: fed eral courts are obligated \\nto adjudicate live controversies. Knox v. Serv. Emps. \\nInt'l Union, Local 1000 , 567 U.S. 298, 307\\u201308 (2012). \\nPlus, the officials' concer n for the vitality of the \\nmootness doctrine is selective. They concede that the \\ndoctrine has not crumbled ev en though a plaintiff can \\navoid mootness by seeking compensation for negli-gible financial damages. Resp.Br.49. So, it will not disintegrate if a plaintiff seeks justice without putting \\nhimself and the courts through the trouble and \\ndisproportionate expense of monetizing, proving, and \\nassessing those injuries, as long experience in the courts of appeals attests. Ar ticle III does not require \\nplaintiffs to repackage no minal-damages claims as \\nsmall damages claims. Both types of claims ensure a \\nlive controversy. \\n17 \\nFar more troublesome problems arise under the \\nofficials' rule, which allows governments to moot \\ncases unilaterally and strategically. That approach \\nallows officials to reinstate unconstitutional policies, a phenomenon that the amici have well documented. \\nFIRE Br. 24\\u201327; Becket Fund Br. 10\\u201314; Just. & Free-\\ndom Fund Br. 9, 15\\u201316 & n.4. It creates incentives for officials to run out the clock on many claims, e.g., \\ndelaying until students gr aduate, or prisoners get \\ntransferred. Islam & Religious Freedom Br. 14\\u201315; Inst. for Free Speech Br. 14\\u20131 5; Becket Fund Br. 23\\u2013\\n25; Christian Legal Soc'y Br. 15\\u201317; FIRE Br. 5\\u20137. \\nIn short, the officials' mootness-related policy \\nconcerns do not justify their invitation to jettison the \\nmajority rule and create a nominal-damages excep-\\ntion to Article III. \\nC. The majority rule neither wastes judicial \\nresources nor prolongs cases.  \\nThe officials and their amici say that the enduring \\nmajority rule wastes judicial resources, prolongs \\nlawsuits, and increases attorney fees. Resp.Br.45; \\nD.C.Br. 13\\u201321. But government officials who quickly and \\\"reasonably respond\\\" when initially alerted to an unconstitutional policy, D.C.Br. 4\\u201311, rarely face protracted litigation. \\nConsider what happened here. Three years before \\nChike tried to speak on campus\\u2014in 2013 \\u2014counsel \\ninformed Georgia Gwinnett officials that their poli-cies were unconstitutional. Pet.App.89a\\u201390a. The of-ficials did nothing. Chike questioned the overbreadth and inconsistency of the officia ls' policies when he was \\nordered to stop speaking in 2016. Id. at 100a\\u201302a. \\nAgain, officials did nothing. When Chike filed suit in \\n18 \\nDecember 2016, the officials did not recant; they dou-\\nbled down, insisting that sharing the Christian faith \\n\\\"arguably rose to the level of 'fighting words'\\\" that the \\nFirst Amendment does not protect. Id. at 155a. \\nIt was not until much later in the case that the \\nofficials changed their unconstitutional policies and then promptly moved to dismiss. Id. at 160a. Imagine \\nhow much litigation and how many constitutional \\ndeprivations the officials could have avoided simply \\nby \\\"reasonably responding\\\" in 2013. \\nThe reality is officials oft en stubbornly refuse to \\nconcede that they have vi olated someone's constitu-\\ntional rights. E.g., N.Y. State Rifle & Pistol Ass'n , 140 \\nS. Ct. at 1538\\u201339 (Alito, J., dissenting) (city fought the \\nplaintiffs' Second Amendment rights \\\"tooth and nail\\\" \\nin lower courts, then strategically changed policy to \\n\\\"moot\\\" the case on the eve of oral argument in this Court). The amici briefs are replete with such examples. E.g., Becket Fund Br. 3 (prison changed \\npolicy \\\"[t]wo weeks before oral argument\\\"); \\nCatholicVote.org Br. 12 n.4 (city repealed ordinance \\n\\\"years into litigation\\\" an d \\\"days\\\" after grant of en \\nbanc review); Pacific Legal Found. Br. 1\\u20132 (city repealed ban \\\"[o]n the eve of oral argument\\\"); FIRE Br. 7 (universities \\\"disavow[  ]\\\" policies \\\"after the \\nstart of litigation\\\"). And though the District of \\nColumbia amici say the Eleventh Circuit's rule \\n\\\"incentivizes government actors to revisit challenged laws,\\\" the brief's listed examples all come from outside the Eleventh Circuit. D.C.Br. 4\\u201311. Indeed, the officials here changed their policies several months before  the Eleventh Circuit adopted its outlier \\nrule, further proving that the majority rule already \\nencourages officials to do the right thing. \\n19 \\nConversely, the longstanding rule does not \\nencourage plaintiffs to pursue pointless litigation \\nsimply to inflict an attorn ey-fee award. This \\\"Court's \\ndecision not to grant fees in Farrar was born of its \\nreluctance to reward attorneys for bringing less than \\nmeritorious claims that see k, but fail to obtain, large \\nmonetary judgments or fail to promote a larger public good.\\\" Project Vote/Voting for Am., Inc.  v. Dickerson , \\n444 F. App'x 660, 664 (4th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) \\n(citing Farrar , 506 U.S. at 116). The same will be true \\nin cases brought simply to harass. But a meritorious \\ncivil-rights claim brought to stop unconstitutional government conduct \\\"is the very form of litigation Congress wished to encourage by enacting \\u00a7  1988.\\\" \\nIbid.  (citing Daly v. Hill, 790 F.2d 1071, 1084 (4th Cir. \\n1986)). Accord, e.g., Fox v. Vice, 563 U.S. 826, 832\\u201333 \\n(2011) (characterizing a successful \\u00a7 1983 plaintiff pursuing \\u00a7 1988 fees as \\\"a private attorney general\\\") (citation omitted). \\\"Deterring meritorious lawsuits on constitutional issues because they offer a small \\nlikelihood of a significant money judgment presents \\nas grave a danger to our legal system as frivolous litigation.\\\" Project Vote , F.

Br. 7\\u201312 (discussing implications of tactical \\nmooting).  \\nIt's not even clear that following the majority rule \\nwould appreciably increase caseloads. The officials \\nhave provided no evidence that the circuits applying \\nthe majority rule have been overwhelmed with nominal-damages cases. Contra Inst. for Free Speech \\nBr. 16\\u201317 n.11 (statistics showing the opposite). In \\nthe long run, reaching the merits conserves judicial \\n20 \\nresources by produc ing precedent that obviates future \\ndisputes\\u2014sometimes on precisely the same issue,  \\nwhere unconstitutional policies are reinstated after a \\ncase has been strategically mooted. Id. at 17; The \\nPoint Isn't Moot , 129 Y ALE L.J.  FORUM  at 338\\u201341. \\nFinally, the most effective way to minimize \\nconstitutional violations is to hold recalcitrant officials accountable, not to deny victims the remedy \\nArticle III allows. Just. & Freedom Fund Br. 17\\u201318; \\ncontra Br. of Nat'l Conf. of State Legislatures 23\\u201324. When, as here, a prospective plaintiff sends government officials a warning letter, alerting them to unconstitutional conduct, the potential negative consequences of a future judgment, see Br. of Nat'l \\nConf. of State Legislatures 23\\u201324, are precisely what \\nmotivate the officials to change course. Officials who \\nknow they can violate constitutional rights without cost have no incentive to stop violating the Constitution. \\nIn sum, allowing the gove rnment to unilaterally \\nmoot claims for past consti tutional violations would \\nundermine the vindication of constitutional rights \\nand the Constitution itself. After all, courts are the \\\"department of the government to whom the protection of the rights of the individual is by the \\nconstitution especially confided.\\\" 1\\n ST. GEORGE \\nTUCKER , BLACKSTONE 'S COMMENTARIES , App. 357 \\n(1803). Prohibiting the government from doing so would not change the prevailing legal landscape. \\n  \\n21 \\nIII. The officials' rule would leave plaintiffs \\nwithout a remedy and result in more violations of constitutional rights.  \\nAbandoning the majority rule would leave some \\nvictims of constitutional violations without a remedy. \\nEquitable relief is often unavailable or easily mooted \\n(as shown here), and constitutional violations often do not cause quantifiable harm. Pet.Br.37; FIRE Br. 5\\u20139. The officials fail to meaningfully engage these points. \\nThe officials first insist that these claims \\\"can \\noften be adjudicated\\\" via \\\"prospective relief.\\\" \\nResp.Br.46. But \\\"can often\\\" means \\\"not always,\\\" since such relief is available only when the illegal conduct \\\"might happen again.\\\" Ibid. Those mistreated under \\na later-repealed policy or  subjected to \\\"one-off\\\" \\nviolations have no such reme dy. This gives officials at \\nleast one \\\"free pass\\\" to violate the Constitution.   \\nSuch a rule also artificia lly constricts the judici-\\nary's ability and duty to protect individual rights \\nbased on an unsupported as surance that officials will \\nuse this leeway altruistic ally and correct mistakes \\nquickly. Perhaps the offic ials' suggested approach \\nwould work if we were governed by angels rather than \\nmere \\\"men.\\\" T\\nHE FEDERALIST NO. 51, at 322 (James \\nMadison) (Clinton Rossiter ed., 1961). But amici \\nrecount myriad experiences demonstrating that the judiciary serves as an important check-and-balance. \\nWorse, civil-rights litigants already face daunting \\nterrain:  persuading attorn eys to pro bono represent \\nthem, exhausting administrative remedies, and surviving immunity, which shields all but those who \\ndefy clearly established law. And at least six circuits \\n22 \\nhave even lowered the burden on officials to show a \\ncase is moot. The Point Isn't Moot , 129 Y ALE L.J.  \\nFORUM  at 333, n.50.

City of Sunrise , 371 F.3d 1320, 1328\\u2013\\n29 (11th Cir. 2004). \\nThis flipped burden forces plaintiffs to prove\\u2014\\nusually with no discovery\\u2014that officials will revert to \\nthe original policy.

It's a perverse incentive to \\nforce  such plaintiffs to demand compensatory \\ndamages they do not want or need. \\nNor are compensatory damages for intangible \\ninjuries a cure-all.

Doubling down on constitutional depriva-tions would inevitably extend off campus to other \\ngovernment officials, endangering not just free speech \\nand religious exercise, but also Second Amendment \\nrights, the right to be free from illegal searches, unlawful detentions, and many others. \\nA constitutional right that cannot be enforced is \\nno right at all.

The late Howard Jarvis, founder of \\nHJTA, utilized the People of  California's reserved \\npower of initiative to sponsor California's well-known Proposition 13 in 1978. Proposition 13 was overwhelm-\\ningly approved by California voters and added Article \\nXIII A to the California Constitution. Proposition 13 has kept thousands of fixed income Californians secure \\nin their ability to stay in their own homes by limiting \\nthe ad valorem property tax rate and annual escala-tion of property taxes.\\n1 \\n HJTA has a central and ongoing interest in pro-\\ntecting homeowners' rights to retain their homes. In \\nthe unfortunate circumstance of financial distress \\nleading to unpaid property taxes and government fore-closure, HJTA continues to  advocate for homeowners \\nbeing able to receive the remaining equity that right-\\nfully belongs to them and, in  all likelihood, will be their \\nsole economic resource for their next stage of life. \\nHJTA has recently supported legislation to that effect \\nin California and written on this vital current topic known as home equity thef t. (Jon Coupal & Joshua \\n \\n 1 Per Rule 37, the parties were notified and consented to the \\nfiling of this brief more than ten days before its filing. See Sup. \\nCt. R. 37.2(a). Blanket consent from Petitioner was also filed Sep-tember 9, 2022. No party's counsel authored any of this brief; ami-\\ncus alone funded its preparation and submission. See Sup. Ct. R. \\n37.6. \\n \\n2 \\n Polk, Stop home equity theft by the state of California , \\nThe Orange County Register (Mar. 27, 2022).2) \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\n The Minnesota statutes at issue violate the Fifth \\nAmendment Takings Clause and the Eighth Amend-\\nment Excessive Fines Clause. They do so by expressly taking home equity for public use without just compen-\\nsation. They also take the owner's equity as excessive \\npunishment for non-payment of taxes, even though in-terest and penalties have already been charged. There \\nis no reason for Ms. Tyler to pay her government a pre-\\nmium of $25,000 on top of the $15,000 she owed, which \\nalready included interest and penalties. \\n \\\"Public use\\\" is clear. The Minnesota statute that \\ndistributed Ms. Tyler's $25,000 in home equity is titled \\n\\\"APPORTIONMENT OF PROCEEDS TO TAXING \\nDISTRICTS.\\\" (Minn. Stat., \\u00a7 282.08.) The more subtle variety of home equity thef t in California also admits \\n\\\"public use\\\" in statute. (Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7 3695.4.) \\n Amicus writes separately to highlight the subtle \\nforms of home equity theft that will likely expand with-\\nout a grant of certiorari in this case. California, men-tioned just briefly in the Petition for Certiorari, is \\nplagued by home equity theft as well, and in dangerous \\n \\n 2 https://www.ocregister.com/2022/03/27/stop-home-equity- \\ntheft-by-the-state -of-california/. \\n3 \\n ways that will fly under the radar without enforcement \\nof the Constitution for Ms. Tyler. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nARGUMENT \\nI. Certiorari should be granted because gov-\\nernment, under the Fifth and Eighth \\nAmendments, must respect, not exploit, vulnerable homeowners. \\nA. No one, includin g government, may ex-\\nploit a tax windfall. \\n Governments do not allow taxpayers to take tax \\nwindfalls. (See Handlery Hotels, Inc. v. Franchise Tax \\nBd. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1360; Franck v. Polaris E-Z \\nGo Div. of Textron  (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 1107.) Gov-\\nernments must likewise not be allowed to take tax \\nwindfalls. As Justice Holmes famously wrote, \\\"[m]en \\nmust turn square corners wh en they deal with the \\nGovernment.\\\" ( Rock Island, A. & L. R. Co. v. United \\nStates  (1920) 254 U.S. 141, 143.) Likewise, particularly \\nwhen so much is at stake, \\\"[ i]t is no less good morals \\nand good law that the Gove rnment should turn square \\ncorners in dealing with the people than that the people \\nshould turn square corners in dealing with their Gov-ernment.\\\" ( St. Regis Paper Co. v. United States  (1961) \\n368 U.S. 208, 229.) Accordingly, governments should \\nnot be trespassers, but trustees, particularly to trag-edy-befallen persons, such as Ms. Tyler, who happen to \\nown a home or other real pro perty that can be levied to \\nsatisfy a tax debt. \\n4 \\n  In this case, as in certain related instances in Cal-\\nifornia, a vulnerable member of society was exploited \\nby her government following a tax sale of her property \\nto cover a delinquency. The Eighth Circuit seems to sanction this as punishment for a distressed home-\\nowner's normal human weaknesses when it writes: \\n\\\"Only after [Ms. Tyler] declined to avail herself of these opportunities did 'abs olute title' pass to the \\nState.\\\" ( Tyler v. Hennepin Cty.  (8th Cir. 2022) 26 F.4th \\n789, 793.) Thus, while the pri mary issue seems to be \\nwhether the retention of Ms. Tyler's $25,000 home eq-\\nuity is a taking under the Fifth Amendment because it \\nwas her property, the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause is at issue as well. (U.S. Const. amend. V; \\namend. XIV, amend. VIII.) The taking of home equity \\nis clearly intended as a p unishment for nonpayment of \\ntaxes and inability to redeem the debt. As aging and \\nmental health issues are only increasing in America, it \\nis a vital question for all whether seizing the value of the whole property for the repayment of a lesser debt \\nis an excessive and abusive use of government power. \\n Homeownership is a precious goal that many \\nAmericans work hard to achieve. Faulting homeowners \\nfor not heeding warnings to redeem their debts through payment plans or re-purchase disrespectfully \\nignores many distressed homeowners' reality. Such \\nhomeowners often come to this position due to age, medical condition, loss of eyesight or other physical \\ndisability, mental impairment, the negligence of a care-\\ngiver, dishonesty of a relative, or simple lack of func-tional support. (Brief of Amicus Curiae AARP and \\n5 \\n AARP Foundation, March 30, 2021, Case No. 20-3730, \\nat pp. 7-8; Johnson v. City of East Orange, N.J. Sup. \\nCourt for Essex County , No. ESX-L-009175-21  [illness \\nof responsible family member]; Hetelekides v. County of \\nOntario (2021) 147 N.Y.S.3d 811  [death of taxpayer]; \\nFoss v. City of New Bedford, Mass. Sup. Court for Bris-\\ntol County , No. 2273CV00243  [disabled retiree suffer-\\ning medical and financial problems].) There are also \\ncases of small, innocently miscalculated underpay-\\nments that turn into nightmares for homeowners and taxpayers alike. ( Perez v. County of Wayne, Mich. Cir. \\nCourt for County of Wayne , No. 19-009286-CZ  [$144 tax \\ndebt; county kept all $108,000 sales proceeds, 750 times the original debt]; Rafaeli, LLC v. Oakland \\nCounty (2020) 505 Mich. 429 [$8. 41 tax debt; county \\nkept all $24,500 sales proceeds, approximately 2,913 times the original debt].) Homeowners suffering from \\ndistress or mistake should not be disproportionally \\npunished by a total loss of  home equity\\u2014perhaps the \\nonly economic resource they have accrued\\u2014but should \\nbe provided a check for the remainder of what they \\nonce rightfully owned. It is a simple calculation and function of government to process such an incredible \\noverpayment. \\n Minnesota's tax windfall here is approximately \\n$25,000 in \\\"net proceeds\\\" from  the sale of Ms. Tyler's \\ncondominium to satisfy he r delinquent property tax \\nbill. ( Tyler v. Hennepin Cty ., 26 F.4th at pp. 790-791.) \\nThe extensive current and hi storical legal support for \\nthese proceeds belonging to Ms. Tyler is well set out \\nin the Petition for Certiorari and will not be repeated \\n6 \\n here, except to concur that relevant takings jurispru-\\ndence directly applies. ( Koontz v. St. Johns River Water \\nManagement Dist . (2013) 570 U.S. 595; Webb's Fabu-\\nlous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith  (1980) 449 U.S. 155.) \\n Minnesota's tax windfall at Ms. Tyler's expense \\nmust be reviewed. Amicus HJTA submits that the \\\"var-ious purposes\\\" of Minnesota Statute section 282.08 \\n(Tyler v. Hennepin Cty ., 26 F.4th at p.  791) are clearly \\nthe same purposes for which taxes are imposed and collected. Accordingly, Minnesota has created a tax \\nloophole for its own benefit at a vulnerable home-\\nowner's expense, a behavior that is repeated in many states as the Petition for Certiorari explains. Minne-\\nsota's claim to Ms. Tyler's $25,000 in home equity is \\neither a taking or an excessive punishment and any-thing else is fiction. Certior ari should be granted to \\nresolve the widespread problem afflicting American \\nhomeowners and the future of homeownership. \\n Even in states where the law recognizes a poten-\\ntial return of excess home equity, there is opportunity for government to under-prioritize the noticing proce-\\ndures and thereby increase the likelihood of taxing \\nauthorities quietly, passively retaining the funds that rightfully belong to the taxpayer. For example, in Cali-\\nfornia, proceeds are not automatically delivered, but \\nmust be claimed within one year. (Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7 4675(a).) Government bureaucracy can be slow or in-\\nefficient enough for notices to be misplaced or sent to \\nthe wrong address in that short time. Even when no-tices timely arrive at the right address, distressed for-\\nmer homeowners may\\u2014conveniently for California \\n7 \\n governments\\u2014not be in sufficient physical or mental \\ncondition to file a claim nor have the aid of someone \\nwho can. After one year with no claim filed, the prop-\\nerty belongs to the State of California, as it is in Min-\\nnesota. Clarity in this case would help California and \\nother states to clean up th eir tax collection laws to \\ncomport with the U.S. Constitution as it regards what is typically an American's most vital asset and symbol \\nof financial stability and prosperity: a home. \\n \\nB. Minnesota's tax windfall for county-\\nsupervised forest management, parks, \\nand general government services is de-\\nfinitively for \\\"public use\\\" and punishes Ms. Tyler for a lack of funds by taking significantly more than was owed. \\n Minnesota Statute section 282.08 would apportion \\nthe $25,000 \\\"net proceeds\\\" of the Tyler tax sale to for-\\nest development, county parks and recreation, and un-restricted general government services. In fact, section \\n282.08 is titled \\\" APPORTIONMENT OF PROCEEDS \\nTO TAXING DISTRICTS .\\\" It is indisputable that \\nmoney transferred to a taxing district is for \\\"public \\nuse\\\" under the Fifth Amendment. That is the only pur-\\npose of such districts. \\n Ms. Tyler's private property has been taken for \\n$25,000 worth of such public use, and similar incidents regularly occur across the country. Without review, \\ngovernments will continue to take tax windfalls out-\\nright, as Minnesota does by statute, or make room in \\n8 \\n statutes for clever designs or carelessness similarly ca-\\npable of producing unjustified windfalls at the expense \\nof the vulnerable. \\n Ms. Tyler did not have the money or the financial \\nsavvy to redeem the property , so the foreclosure pro-\\nceedings ensued. HJTA does not debate this. HJTA as-serts that Ms. Tyler's prope rty has been taken and she \\nhas been excessively punished for having no money or \\nability to redeem the property, a state of being that is \\nnot even a disobedient act, much less a crime. Never-\\ntheless she has been fined, and the amount of her fine \\nis undoubtedly extreme. With the $40,000 sale of her home, Ms. Tyler paid her $15,000 debt (inclusive of ex-\\nisting penalties and interest) nearly 3 times. Given the \\neveryday prevalence of homeownership, hardship, and government use of tax sales on real property to satisfy \\ndebt, the Court should grant certiorari to make clear \\nin all states what is th e minimum standard under the \\nTakings Clause and/or whether this is an impermissi-\\nble, excessive punishment for unpaid taxes. \\n \\nII. The California Le gislature maintains a \\nvariant of the problem, also taking prop-\\nerty for \\\"public use,\\\" and demonstrates no \\ninclination to correct it. \\n Although California is not part of the extensive \\nsplit of authority among states on the parallel issue to \\nMs. Tyler's, which immediately  speaks volumes as to \\nthe need for certiorari, California's tax sales statutes demonstrate a more subtle abuse of homeowners. As \\n9 \\n the Petition for Certiorari briefly explained, \\\"[Califor-\\nnia] law permits confiscation of the entire value when \\nmunicipalities claim the indebted property for a public \\nuse or economic revitalization.\\\" (Pet. at 31.) Without clarification on certiorari, California's laws taking \\nhome equity from vulnerable citizens will continue to \\nwreak havoc unchecked. \\n In California, a tax-defaulting homeowner gener-\\nally has one year to claim remaining home equity from a tax sale like the one Ms. Tyler's property underwent. \\n(Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7 4675(a).) When property is \\nsold at a tax auction, and a claim is filed, disbursement \\nof the excess funds proceeds as follows: \\n(A) First, to lienholders of record prior to the \\nrecordation of the tax deed to the purchaser in \\nthe order of their priority. \\n(B) Second, to any person with title of record \\nto all or any portion of the property prior to \\nthe recordation of the tax deed to the pur-chaser. \\n(Id. at 4675(e).) \\n Though far from perfect, this provision comports \\nmore with the Constitution than does the Minnesota law in this case. \\n But there is another Ca lifornia law which causes \\nhome equity theft like Minnesota's. Working with a \\nnonprofit organization, the st ate or a local government \\nmay file an \\\"objection\\\" with the county tax collector to stop the open-market sa le under section 4675 and \\n10 \\n redirect the sale to exclus ive no-bid proceedings un-\\nder another statutory scheme. (Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\n\\u00a7 3695.4.) The state or local government may do this \\nfor \\\"any property that is or may be needed for public use.\\\" ( Ibid.) A nonprofit organization may also file an \\n\\\"objection\\\" on its own to trigger such special proceed-\\nings by providing a written promise to sell or rent to low-income persons. (Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7 3695.5.) \\nIn these cases, not only are no proceeds returned to the \\nhomeowner, but the homeowner will not be able to claim their remaining home equity as they could have \\nwithin one year under section 4675 because it will be \\ntaken by design. Their remaining home equity is taken for \\\"public use\\\" by government, developers or nonprof-\\nits. (Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7 3695.4.) \\n This special procedure is known as a Chapter 8 \\nsale. (See Cal Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7\\u00a7 3771-3841.) The non-\\nprofit organization or government-partnered developer gains an exclusive agreement to purchase the property \\nfor just the total amount due to the government. ( Id. at \\n\\u00a7\\u00a7 3791.4; 3793.1.) This absorbs  the home equity be-\\ncause it is not an open-market sale. And home equity \\ninterests, similar to Ms. Tyler's, are taken for \\\"public \\nuse\\\" thereby. (Cal. Rev. & Tax Code, \\u00a7 3695.4.) This clearly demands Fifth Amendment review. \\n California legislators, however, are unmotivated to \\nbring these statutes into compliance with the Takings \\nClause or Excessive Fines Clause. On February 7, 2022, \\nAssembly Bill 1839 was introduced. AB1839 would have required that an open public auction occur before \\nany Chapter 8 sale, thus at minimum affording every \\n11 \\n defaulted homeowner one chance to recover their re-\\nmaining home equity. The California Association of \\nCounty Treasurers and Tax Collectors supported the \\nbill, and no one opposed. (Assem. Com. On Rev. and Tax., Analysis of Assem. Bill. No. 1839 (2021-2022 Reg. \\nSess.) as amended Mar. 22, 202 2, at p. 3, Hearing Date \\nApril 25, 2022.) \\n Unfortunately, AB1839 died in committee on April \\n26, 2022. What is worse, other legislation had been simultaneously proposed to expand  the definition of \\nan eligible nonprofit under the Chapter 8 sales pro-\\nceedings, thus intending to make home equity theft more likely. (Assem. Com. on Rev. and Tax., Analysis \\nof Assem. Bill No. 2021 (2021-2022 Reg. Sess.) as \\namended April 7, 2022, at p. 1, Hearing Date April 25, 2022 [\\\"Expands eligible uses for which a nonprofit or-\\nganization may object to a sale of tax-defaulted prop-\\nerty by public auction or sealed bid\\\"].) California, along with Minnesota and the many other states discussed \\nin the Petition for Certiorari,  sorely need application of \\nthe Takings Clause and Excessive Fines Clause to re-turn home equity proceeds to distressed homeowners \\nfollowing the sales of their homes to repay tax debts. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------\",\n          \".............................. ...............  22 \\nAPPENDIX  ................................ ....................  1a \\n \\n \\nii \\nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES  \\nPage(s)\\nCases  \\nAm.

This en-\\nsures arbitration achieves its basic purpose of \\nresol ving disputes efficie ntly, predictably, and at \\nminimal cost. In support of those goals, The Center \\nsubmits this brief in support of Petitioner Coin-\\nbase, Inc., arguing that the decision of the Ninth \\nCircuit countenancing the district court's discretion \\nto deny a stay of litigat ion pending interlocutory \\nappeal should be reversed and its opinion vacated.  \\nINTRODUCTION AND  \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT  \\nAn interlocutory appeal under Section 16(a) of \\nthe Federal Arbi tration Act addresses  the thresh-\\nold question of arbitrability. This Court should hold \\nthat such an appeal divests the district court of ju-\\nrisdiction and requires a mandatory stay of all liti-\\ngation.  \\nArbitration and litigation are distinct mecha-\\nnisms of dis pute resolution. They  cannot coexist. \\nParties choose arbitration to avoid litigation. Once \\na party has been forced to litigate, this purpose is \\ndestroyed. The loud, resonating bell of litigation, \\nonce heard by all, cannot be un -rung.3 Its course \\n \\n 3 Levin v. Alms & Assocs., I nc., 634  F.3d 260, 265 (4th \\nCir. 2011).  \\n3 \\nand its ef fects remain even if an appellate court re-\\nverses. Parties who litigate will suffer the conse-\\nquences, whatever they may be.  \\nThe Ninth Circuit (along with the Second and \\nFifth Circuits) has adopted an untenable rule that \\nwill adversely impact the bargained -for rights of \\nmillion s of American businesses and individuals \\nwho are parties to arbitration agreements in many \\ndiverse industries and contexts. Since the 1990s, \\nthe use of arbitration clauses in consumer, em-\\nployment, and commercial contracts has increased .   \\nGiven the prolife ration of arbitration, the Ninth \\nCircuit's holding goes far beyond affecting business \\ninterests. Recent scholarship explains an effort by \\nplaintiff -claimants and their sophisticated attor-\\nneys to seize upon arbitration provisions in com-\\nmonplace consumer agr eements. Those claimants \\nseek to \\\"turn the tables\\\" on business interests by \\nusing arbitration agreements to file mass arbitra-\\ntions strategically intended to overwhelm and dis-\\nrupt the operations of their opponents. Put simply, \\nthis issu e affects a significa nt number of U.S. peo-\\nple and businesses and is not unique to businesses.  \\nThere are valid reasons why parties prefer arbi-\\ntration. Like Petitioner Coinbase, Inc., a party who \\nbargains for arbitration may seek streamlined, \\nfaster procedur es; control (such as input on the de-\\ncisionmaker); limitations on invasive and costly  \\ninter -party, third -party, and expert discovery; add-\\ned protections for confidential information; less  \\nadversarial and more collaborative adjudications; \\n4 \\nand final resoluti ons without the risk of protracted \\nappeal.  \\nCivil lawsuits in federal court, by contrast, are \\nnot as predictable. Litigation comes with broad dis-\\ncovery and unpredictable delay. Positions are \\nstaked out early on as one side or the other scores \\nwins in pretri al motions and deposi tions held long \\nbefore trial. Cases are more easily won on technical \\nvictories. No one person has any final say about \\nhow a lawsuit will take its course. Any given law-\\nsuit has a life of its own, often experiencing a form \\nof self -propel led but uncontrolled mom entum.  \\nThere are ripple effects. These costs of litigation \\npersist even if an appeal is won and a case is trans-\\nferred to arbitration after a period of forced litiga-\\ntion. This includes direct costs such as attorney \\nfees, expert fees , and litigation expe nses. There are \\nalso indirect costs. Indirect costs include disposi-\\ntive changes to the probable substantive outcome \\nresulting from, for example, damning discovery dis-\\nclosures, dismissals for technicalities, and pretrial \\nrulings that ch ange the course, tone , and tenor of \\nthe case \\u2014all of which might not have happened in \\narbitration.  \\nThe minority position says these concerns beg \\nthe question. After all, a defendant who loses on \\nappeal had no right to arbitrate to begin with and \\nthat defen dant has already lost  once. If the appel-\\nlate court affirms, then the plaintiff will be preju-\\ndiced by having to wait. That may be. But a \\nplaintiff who is asked to hold tight \\u2014and to wait on-\\n5 \\nly for the time it takes to have an appeal decided \\u2014\\ndoes not suffer th e same risk of harm. Delay is not \\nlike the permanent, possibly irreparable harm as-\\nsociated with discovery, case dynamics, and party \\npositioning in civil litigation undertaken while a \\ncase is on appeal on the issue of arbitrability.  \\nA defendant seeking  an interlocutory appeal  \\nunder Section 16(a) of the FAA is asking for protec-\\ntion from the permanent and un -windable litiga-\\ntion process (which it argues it contracted to avoid) \\nduring the limited time when arbitrability is an \\nopen question. Such a defendan t is not asking to \\narbitrate the dispute in the face of a loss, while on \\nappeal. Delay alone does not outweigh the pre-\\nsumptive prejudice to the party seeking to enforce \\narbitration. Where the very function of arbitration \\nis to avoid litigation and where th e issue on appeal \\nis whether litigation can proceed, the defendant \\nshould not have to bear the burden and costs of lit-\\nigation before that question is finally determined.  \\nThis conclusion is buttressed by the differences \\nin reversal rates between appeals fr om denials of \\narbitration as compared to appeals in civil cases as \\na whole. Scholars observe that circuit courts re-\\nversed approximately half of cases involving deni-\\nals of arbitration (as compared to a mere 10 to 20% \\nof civil cases as a whole, depending on the year ex-\\namined). This statistic is no surprise, however, as \\nit accords with the strong legislative policy in favor \\nof arbitration. This policy would predictably gener-\\nate more reversals of denials of arbitration.   \\n6 \\nThe majority rule better serves the rel evant in-\\nterests of both individuals/consumers and busi-\\nnesses. Further, a clear, bright -line rule better \\nserves the liberal federal public policy favoring ar-\\nbitration and federal court judicial economy. The \\nautomatic stay rule and the divestiture principle \\nare such rules. They promote judicial economy by \\nfreeing up district court resources while cases are \\non appeal and by preventing needless expenditure \\nof district court resources on litigating applications \\nfor discretionary stay. These principles promote \\nconsistency of rulings between trial and appellate \\ncourts. They also advance the form and structure of \\nthe federal civil justice system with its unique \\nfunctions of district and appellate courts.  \\nThe Ninth Circuit got it wrong when it held that \\na district c ourt retains jurisdiction to proceed with \\nlitigation despite a non -frivolous appeal of the de-\\nnial of a motion to compel arbitration. The Third, \\nFourth, Seventh, Tenth, Eleventh, and D.C. Cir-\\ncuits decided the issue correctly when they found \\nthat an interloc utory appeal under Section 16(a) of \\nthe Federal Arbitration Act automatically divests \\nthe district court of jurisdiction and requires a \\ncomplete stay of all litigation. The Ninth Circuit \\nshould be reversed. Its opinion should be vacated.  \\n7 \\nARGUMENT  \\nI. Strong, well -established federal policy \\nliberally favors arbitration.  \\nThe Federal Arbitration Act (\\\"FAA\\\") was passed \\nin 1925. Its goal wa s \\\"to reverse the longstanding \\njudicial hostility to arbitration agreements.\\\"4 It al-\\nso sought \\\"to place arbitration agreements 'upon \\nthe same footing as other contracts.' \\\"5 The FAA \\nembodies a \\\"liberal federal policy favoring arbitra-\\ntion.\\\"6 \\\"The  overarching pur pose of the FAA . . . . \\nis to ensure the enforcement of arbitration agree-\\nments according to their terms so as to facilitate \\nstreamlined proceedings.\\\"7  \\n \\n 4 Gilmer v.

      "{'I. THE RULE OF LENITY SHOULD BE APPLIED RIGOROUSLY TO MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCING STATUTES': '\"[T]he rule of lenity[] teach[es] that ambiguities \\nabout the breadth of a cri minal statute should be \\nresolved in the defendant\\'s favor.\"  United States v. \\nDavis , 139 S. Ct. 2319, 2333 ( 2019).  That rule has \\nfamously been described as \"\\'perhaps not much less old than\\' the task of statut ory \\'construction itself.\\'\"  \\nId. (quoting United States v. Wiltberger , 18 U.S.  \\n(5 Wheat.) 76, 95 (1820) (Marshall, C.J.)).   \\nAt its core the rule of le nity is an understanding \\nthat \"a fair warning should be given to the world in \\nlanguage that the common world will understand,  \\nof what the law intends to  do if a certain line is \\npassed,\" and that, \"[t]o make  the warning fair, so far \\nas possible the line sh ould be clear.\"  McBoyle v. \\nUnited States , 283 U.S. 25, 27 (1931) (Holmes, J.).  In \\naddition, judicial adherence to the rule of lenity also \"places the weight of inertia upon the party\" – that \\nis, the executive branch – \"that can best induce \\nCongress to speak more clearly and keeps courts \\n 7 \\nfrom making criminal law in Congress\\'s stead.\"  \\nUnited States v. Santos , 553 U.S. 507, 514 (2008) \\n(plurality); see Bell v. United States , 349 U.S. 81, 83 \\n(1955) (Frankfurter, J.) (\" When Congress leaves to \\nthe Judiciary the task of imputing to Congress an \\nundeclared will, the ambiguity should be resolved in \\nfavor of lenity.\"). \\nIn several cases involving mandatory minimum \\nsentencing provisions, the Court has recognized and \\napplied the \"presupposition . . . [that] doubts in the enforcement of a penal code\" should be \"resolve[d] . . . \\nagainst the imposition of a harsher punishment.\"  Bell, 349 U.S. at 83.  Examples include Davis , which \\ninvoked lenity to reject a broader saving construction of a different provision of the same mandatory mini-\\nmum statute at issue here, see 139 S. Ct. at 2333; \\nBurrage v. United States , 571 U.S. 204 (2014), which \\ndescribed a 15-year mandat ory minimum statute as \\n\"a criminal statute subject to the rule of lenity,\" and \\nlenity as a reason the Court \"[e]specially\" could not \\ndepart from the \"ordinary,  accepted meaning\" of  \\n\"the [statutory] text,\" id. at 216; and United States  \\nv. Granderson , 511 U.S. 39 (1994), which \"appl[ied] \\nthe rule of lenity\" to \"resolve [an] ambiguity\" in a \"mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment\" \\nafter revocation of probation, id. at 56-57.  Those \\ndecisions cohere with others explaining that the rule of lenity assists \"not only to resolve issues about the \\nsubstantive scope of criminal statutes, but to answer questions about the severity of sentencing.\"  United \\nStates v. R.L.C. , 503 U.S. 291, 306 (1992) (plurality) \\n(citing Bifulco v. United States , 447 U.S. 381, 387 \\n(1980) (collecting cases)). \\nIndeed, especially good reasons warrant applying \\nthe rule of lenity rigorously to statutes that, like the \\nACCA, create aggravated offenses with mandatory \\n 8 \\nminimum sentences.  A broad construction bars \\njudges from tailoring the sentence to the offense and \\nthe offender, leading to particularly harsh conse-\\nquences that only Congress can correct.  A narrower \\nconstruction, by contrast, does not prevent judges \\nfrom imposing longer sentences where necessary.  \\n\"These interpretive asymmetries give the rule of \\nlenity special force in the context of mandatory \\nminimum provisions.\"  Dean v. United States , 556 \\nU.S. 568, 585 (2009) (Breyer, J., dissenting). \\nFurther, experience shows that mandatory mini-\\nmum statutes frequently present difficult problems \\nof statutory construction, creating a heightened risk \\nthat courts will read them to impose sentences that \\nCongress never intended.  Wh ere, as here, an unclear \\nstatute presents a palpable risk of error, courts \\nproperly refuse to \"condemn a man to a minimum of \\n15 years in prison on the basis of . . . speculation,\" \\nBegay v. United States , 553 U.S. 137, 154 (2008) \\n(Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment), about what \\nCongress meant to say.'}\n",
      "{'A. The Rule of Lenity Helps Avoid the Particularly High Costs of Reading Mandatory Minimums Too Broadly': '1. The costs of erroneously construing mandatory \\nminimum sentencing provisions too broadly are especially high, and the costs of construing them too \\nnarrowly are especially low.  The greatest cost of \\nreading a mandatory minimu m too broadly is that \\nindividual defendants lose  their liberty.  Mandatory \\nminimum provisions are, by design, severe.  They \\noften tie an additional prison sentence of years or \\ndecades (here, a decade and a half) to a single factual \\ndetermination.  Such provisions therefore speak to \\nthe core concern that has motivated courts to apply \\nthe rule of lenity for centuries:  the \"instinctive \\n 9 \\ndistaste[] against men lang uishing in prison unless \\nthe lawmaker has clearly sa id they should.\"  Henry \\nJ. Friendly, \"Mr. Justice Frankfurter and the Reading of Statutes,\" in Benchmarks  196, 209 (1967), \\nquoted in United States v. Bass , 404 U.S. 336, 348 \\n(1971).  Because of that concern, this Court \"will not \\ninterpret a federal criminal statute so as to increase \\nthe penalty that it places on an individual when such \\nan interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what Congress intended.\"  Ladner v. \\nUnited States , 358 U.S. 169, 178 (1958). \\nFurther, mandatory minimum provisions often are \\nsaid to reflect (at least in theory) the moral judgment \\nof the community that particular conduct deserves \\nharsher punishment.  In our system of government, \\nthat judgment is reserved to the legislature.  The \\nrule of lenity ensures that criminal sentences \\nactually reflect legislative judgment, rather than \\nguesswork by the courts abo ut what the legislature \\nmeant.  See Granderson , 511 U.S. at 69 (Kennedy, J., \\nconcurring in the judgment) (\"\\'[B]ecause criminal punishment usually represents the moral condemna-\\ntion of the community, legislatures and not courts \\nshould define criminal activity,\\' and set the punish-\\nments therefor.\") (quoting Bass , 404 U.S. at 348) \\n(citation omitted); R.L.C. , 503 U.S. at 309 (Scalia, J., \\nconcurring in part and co ncurring in the judgment) \\n(describing one of \"the rule of lenity\\'s . . . purpose[s]\" \\nas \"assuring that the society, through its represen-\\ntatives, has genuinely called for the punishment to \\nbe meted out\"); Wiltberger , 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) at 95 \\n(explaining that \"[t]he rule that penal laws are to  be construed strictly\" is  founded not merely on \\n\"tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals\" \\nbut also on the \"plain principle that the power of \\n 10 \\npunishment is vested in the legislative, not in the \\njudicial department\"). \\nAny criminal statute presents these concerns,  \\nbut mandatory minimum provisions make them \\nparticularly weighty.  Unlike other criminal laws, \\nmandatory minimums are exceptions to the principle \\nthat courts should \"impose a sentence sufficient,  \\nbut not greater than necessary,\" to accomplish the goals of criminal punishme nt after considering  \\n\"the nature and circumstances of the offense and  \\nthe history and characteristics of the defendant.\"   \\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1).  A mandatory minimum is a \\ncongressional directive to subordinate justice in \\nindividual cases to a perceived need for greater \\ndeterrence or incapacitation generally.  Congress may choose to make that tradeoff (within constitu-\\ntional bounds), but the courts should ensure that \\nCongress has actually made that choice before \\nimposing needlessly harsh punishments.  Cf. Busic  \\nv. United States , 446 U.S. 398, 408-09 (1980) \\n(interpreting a sentencing enhancement; rejecting the \"assumption that . . . Congress\\' sole objective  \\nwas to increase the penalties . . . to the maximum \\nextent possible\"). \\n2. The adverse consequences of erroneously \\nexpanding mandatory sentencing beyond the limits of congressional intent affect more than just \\nindividual defendants.  Such errors strike at the \\nfoundations of the sentencing system by under-\\nmining \"sentencing proportionality – a key element of sentencing fairness.\"  Harris v. United States , 536 \\nU.S. 545, 570-71 (2002) (Breye r, J., concurring in \\npart and concurring in the judgment), overruled by \\nAlleyne v. United States , 570 U.S. 99 (2013).  As the \\nSentencing Commission – quoted with approval by this Court – has explained:  \"\\'The \"cliffs\" that result \\n 11 \\nfrom mandatory minimums compromise proportion-\\nality, a fundamental prem ise for just punishment, \\nand a primary goal of the Sentencing Reform Act.\\'\"  Neal v. United States , 516 U.S. 284, 291-92 (1996) \\n(quoting United States Sentencing Comm\\'n, Special \\nReport to the Congress:  Mandatory Minimum \\nPenalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System  iii \\n(Aug. 1991)). \\nFurther, the rule of leni ty historically has been \\njustified in part based on the \"principle of legality\":  conduct can be criminalized , and penalties author-\\nized, only by legislative action, so \"that the amount  \\nof discretion entrusted to those who enforce the law \\ndoes not exceed tolerable lim its.\"  Herbert L. Packer, \\nThe Limits of the Criminal Sanction  93 (1968).  As \\nthe Court put it in Marinello v. United States , 138 S. \\nCt. 1101 (2018), \"prosecutorial discretion\" to enforce \\na statute with \"wide-rangin g scope . . . places great \\npower in the hands of the prosecutor,\" creating risks of \"nonuniform execution\" and \"arbitary prosecution.\"  \\nId. at 1108-09.  That concern is one reason for  \\nthe Court\\'s \"\\'traditional[] exercise[]\\'\" of \"\\'restraint in \\nassessing the reach of a federal criminal statute.\\'\"  Id. at 1109 (quoting United States v. Aguilar , 515 \\nU.S. 593, 600 (1995)).  And it is a special problem \\nwith mandatory minimums that effectively transfer \\nsentencing discretion from the trial judge, \"the one \\nactor in the system most ex perienced with exercising \\ndiscretion,\" to \"an assistant prosecutor not trained in \\nthe exercise of discretion.\"   An Address by Anthony \\nM. Kennedy, Associate Justic e, Supreme Court of the \\nUnited States, Speech at the American Bar Associ-\\nation Annual Meeting (Aug. 9, 2003), available at  \\nhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/speeches/sp_08-09-03.html. \\n 12 \\nInconsistently exercised discretion means that, in \\npractice, mandatory minimums fail to yield even \\nuniformity in sentencing – the benefit they are \\nsupposed to obtain at the cost of individual justice \\nand proportionality.  Over decades, the Sentencing \\nCommission has repeatedly reported \"inconsisten[cy]\" \\nand \"wide geographic variations\" in the use of mandatory minimum sentences.  E.g., United States \\nSentencing Comm\\'n, Application and Impact of  \\n21 U.S.C. § 851:  Enhanced  Penalties for Federal \\nDrug Trafficking Offenders  6 (July 2018) (finding \\n\"significant variation in the extent to which . . . enhanced penalties were sought against eligible \\noffenders\"); see also United States v. Angelos , 345  \\nF. Supp. 2d 1227, 1252 (D. Utah 2004) (discussing \\n\"the potential for tremendous sentencing disparity if \\nfederal prosecutors across th e country do not uniformly \\ncharge . . . violations\" of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)), aff\\'d , 433 \\nF.3d 738 (10th Cir. 2006).\\n2   \\n                                                 \\n2 See also  United States Sentencing Comm\\'n, Mandatory \\nMinimum Penalties for Sex Offenses in the Federal Criminal \\nJustice System  56 (Jan. 2019) (finding that, \"[i]n fiscal year \\n2016, the mandatory minimum penalty for receipt [of child por-nography] [wa]s inconsistently applied,\" leading to \"substantial\" \\ndifferences in sentences where \"the conduct involved in the  \\noffenses was not meaningfully distinguishable\"); United States Sentencing Comm\\'n, Report to Congress:  Mandatory Minimum \\nPenalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System  345 (Oct. \\n2011) (\"2011 Report\") (finding \"inconsistencies in application  \\nof certain mandatory minimum penalties, as shown by . . .  \\ndata analyses and confirmed by interviews of prosecutors and \\ndefense attorneys\"); United States Sentencing Comm\\'n, Fifteen \\nYears of Guidelines Sentencing:  An Assessment of How Well  \\nthe Federal Criminal Justice System is Achieving the Goals  of Sentencing Reform  89 (Nov. 2004) (\"Research over the past \\nfifteen years has consistently found that mandatory penalty \\nstatutes are used inconsistently in cases in which they appear \\nto apply.\"). \\n 13 \\nIndeed, over the last two decades, different \\nAttorneys General have instructed federal prose-\\ncutors differently on how to use mandatory minimum \\nstatutes, switching between more- and less-aggressive \\napproaches.3  In adopting such policies, the executive \\nbranch takes into its own hands the tradeoff between \\nsentencing uniformity, on the one hand, and \\nindividual justice and proportionality, on the other.  Whatever the wisdom of the competing approaches, \\nthat practice emphasizes how mandatory minimum \\nstatutes transfer power over  individual liberty from \\nlawmakers and judges to pr osecutors.  In our adver-\\nsarial system, moreover, pr osecutors can and do use \\nthat power strategically in ways that undermine \\nstructural protections for individual liberties, such as by using the threat of a mandatory minimum to \\nobtain a guilty plea.  See United States v. Kupa ,  \\n976 F. Supp. 2d 417, 420 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) \\n(condemning the practice of \"coerc[ing] guilty pleas, \\nand sometimes . . . coerc[ing] cooperation as well,  \\n[by] routinely threaten[ing] ultra-harsh, enhanced mandatory sentences that no one  – not even the \\nprosecutors themselves – thinks are appropriate\") \\n(footnote omitted),  aff \\'d, 616 F. App\\'x 33  (2d Cir. 2015) . \\n                                                 \\n3 See Angelos , 345 F. Supp. 2d at 1253 & n.120 (discussing a \\n2003 memorandum intended \"to reduce charging disparities \\nstemming from § 924(c)\"); United States Sentencing Comm\\'n, \\nAn Overview of Mandatory Minim um Penalties in the Federal \\nCriminal Justice System 24-25 (July 2017) (comparing the 2013 \\n\"Smart on Crime\" initiative, which outlined circumstances  \\nin which prosecutors should \"\\'decline to charge\\'\" mandatory \\nminimum sentences, to \"revised guidance\" in 2017 directing \\nprosecutors generally to \"\\'charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense,\\'\" with seriousness measured by the \\ngreatest sentence, \" \\'including mandatory minimum sentences\\' \"). \\n 14 \\nNor does the expansion of prosecutorial power \\nthrough mandatory minimum statutes stop at the \\ncharging stage.  Even after conviction, the prosecutor \\nholds an important key to lessening the effect of a \\nmandatory minimum sentence.  A district court is \\nfreed from restrictions on its sentencing discretion \\n\"[u]pon motion of the Government . . . so as to reflect \\na defendant\\'s substantial assistance in the investi-gation or prosecution of another person,\" 18 U.S.C. \\n§ 3553(e), or it can similarly reduce the sentence \\nlater, again with the government\\'s approval, under \\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b)(4).\\n4  Suc h \\ndiscretionary motions have large effects on \\nsentences, often reducing them by many years.5  \\nResearch has found \"enorm ous differences in how \\nprosecutors exercise that di scretion, with substantial \\nvariation by district.\"6  Again, within broad constitu-\\ntional bounds, Congress has the power to create such \\na system.  But the Court need not and should not \\nbroaden more than Congress\\'s language requires \\n                                                 \\n4 In certain cases involving no n-violent drug offenders, a  \\ndistrict judge may invoke 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f), often called a  \\njudicial \"safety valve,\" but the sa fety valve is \"narrow\" and still \\nrequires prosecutorial approval in substance if not in form.   \\nRachel E.

By contrast, the costs of erroneously \\nconstruing a mandatory minimum provision too \\nnarrowly are relatively low, both for individual cases \\nand for the criminal justice system as a whole.  In \\ncases that fall outside the scope of a mandatory \\nminimum, but that nevertheless feature aggravating \\ncircumstances similar to those that moved Congress \\nto impose the minimum, a sentencing judge still has discretion (guided by § 3553(a) and the sentencing \\nguidelines) to impose a more severe sentence.  As Justice Breyer explained in Dean , \"an interpretive \\nerror on the side of leniency[] still permits  the \\nsentencing judge to impose a sentence similar to, \\nperhaps close to, the statutor y sentence even if that \\nsentence . . . is not legislatively required .\"  556 U.S. \\nat 584 (Breyer, J., dissenting). \\nMoreover, \"an error that excludes (erroneously) a \\nset of instances Congress me ant to include . . . could \\nlead the Sentencing Commission to focus on those cases . . . [and] make avail able to Congress a body of \\nevidence and analysis that w ill help it reconsider the \\nstatute.\"  Id. at 585.  Those who bring actions under \\nthe criminal laws (the executive branch) have far greater access to thos e who create them (the \\nlegislative branch) than do those who defend against \\nsuch actions (potential criminal defendants).  In light \\nof this practical reality, the rule of lenity \"places the \\nweight of inertia upon the party that can best induce \\nCongress to speak more clearly.\"  Santos , 553 U.S. at \\n514 (plurality).  \\n 16'}\n",
      "{'B. The Risk of Reading Mandatory Minimums Too Broadly Is Also Particularly High': 'The risk of mistaking congressional intent is also \\nunusually high in the case of mandatory minimum \\nprovisions.  Those provisions often do not originate \\nfrom a careful and considered drafting process.   \\nThe history of the \"occasions different from one \\nanother\" language of § 924(e) (1) is a good example:  \\nas petitioner shows in detail, that language stemmed \\nfrom then-Solicitor-General  Fried\\'s confession of \\nerror to this Court in Petty v. United States , 481 U.S. \\n1034 (1987) (No. 86-6263).  In that case, the United States candidly admitted that the different-occasions \\nlanguage, present in \"other enhanced penalty \\nprovisions,\" was omitted from the predecessor to \\n§ 924(e)(1), even though the legislative history \\nshowed \"that both Congress and those supporting the legislation, including the Department of Justice, did \\nnot intend that the penalty provision would apply \\nmore broadly than in the case of the other federal \\nenhanced penalty statutes.\"   Pet. Br. App. 25a-26a; \\nsee id.  at 26a-31a. \\nHad the United States not taken the unusual step \\nof confessing error in Petty , the courts might well \\nhave concluded – as the Eighth Circuit already had –that Congress had intentionally left the different-occasions language out of th e statute.  After all,  \\nas the Solicitor General\\'s brief pointed out, courts \\nconstruing statutes often draw a \"negative implica-\\ntion\" from the omission of  language in one statute \\nthat is present in anot her, similar statute.  Id. at  \\n26a (citing Rodriguez v. United States , 480 U.S. 522, \\n525 (1987) (per curiam)).  An d courts reaching that \\nconclusion would have imposed minimum 15-year \\nsentences, not based on a \"genuine[] call[] for th[at] \\n 17 \\npunishment\" by \"society[\\'s] . . . representatives,\" R.L.C. , \\n503 U.S. at 309 (Scalia, J., concurrring in part and concurring in the judgment), but based on a slip of the legislative pen. \\nThere are other examples.  Indeed, § 924(e) \\npresents one:  its \"residual clause\" defined a \"violent \\nfelony\" to include any felony that \"involves conduct \\nthat presents a serious potential risk of physical \\ninjury.\"  18 U.S.C. § 924( e)(2)(B)(ii).  This Court \\nstruck that clause down as unconstitutionally vague \\nin Johnson v. United States , 576 U.S. 591 (2015), \\nrelying in part on \"[n]ine years\\' experience trying to derive meaning from the residual clause\" as evidence \\nthat the courts had \"embarked upon a failed enterprise.\"  Id. at 601-02.  And the Court reached \\nthe same conclusion in Davis as to § 924(e)\\'s cousin \\n§ 924(c), striking down a similarly vague clause that \\ntriggered mandatory minimum sentences of 5, 7, 10, and 25 years.  See 139 S. Ct. at 2325, 2336. \\nIn United States v. O\\'Brien , 560 U.S. 218 (2010), \\nthe Court described as \" unclear\" yet another provi-\\nsion of § 924(c) that i mposed a 30-year mandatory \\nminimum sentence for possessing a machinegun \\nwhile committing certain crimes.  Id. at 227, 229.  \\nFacing that lack of clarity, the Court applied a  five-factor test to determine whether machinegun \\npossession was intended to be an offense element  or as a sentencing factor.  See id. at 227-32.  In \\nGranderson , the Court diplomatically observed that \\n18 U.S.C. § 3565(a), imposi ng a mandatory minimum \\nsentence for certain revocations of parole, did not \\n\"appear[] . . . to have received Congress\\' careful \\nattention.\"  511 U.S. at 42.  Justice Scalia less \\ndiplomatically called § 3565(a) \"wretchedly drafted.\"  \\nId. at 60 (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment). \\n 18 \\nThe Court\\'s repeated struggles with opaque text \\nand structure in mandatory minimum provisions  \\nare the kind of \"experience\"  that is \"the life of the \\nlaw.\"  Johnson , 576 U.S. at 601.  That experience \\nteaches that mandatory minimum sentencing statutes, including the one at issue here, commonly \\nuse \"sweeping and imprecise language\" that \"set[s] \\nup a host of vexing constitutional and statutory \\ninterpretation questions for the courts.\"  Barkow, \\nCategorical Mistakes , 133 Harv. L. Rev. at 202.   \\nThe rule of lenity, \"as a so rt of \\'junior version of  \\nthe vagueness doctrine,\\'\" United States v. Lanier , \\n520 U.S. 259, 266 (1997) (quoting Packer, Criminal \\nSanction  at 95), is a useful doctrinal approach to \\nanswering those questions.  If the Court finds the \\nstatute now before it ambiguous, lenity can help – \\nand an emphasis on lenity in the context of \\nmandatory minimum statutes can help guide the \\nlower courts to solve futu re, similar problems that \\nwill inevitably arrive.\\n7 \\n                                                 \\n7 Some have stated that \"a court must find not just ambiguity \\nbut \\'grievous ambiguity\\' before resorting to the rule of lenity.\"  \\nShular v. United States , 140 S. Ct. 779, 788 & n.2 (2020)  \\n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (collecting examples).  Other recent decisions, drawing on a long line of authority, have applied \\nprinciples of lenity without the adjective \"grievous.\"  See, e.g., \\nDavis , 139 S. Ct. at 2333 (invoking lenity where \"a criminal \\nstatute . . . d[id] not clearly proscribe\" conduct and stating that \\n\"ambiguities about the breadth of a criminal statute should  be resolved in the defendant\\'s favor\").  The notion that lenity \\napplies only in cases of \"grievous ambiguity\" appeared in this \\nCourt\\'s cases relatively recently.  See Chapman v. United \\nStates , 500 U.S. 453, 463 (1991) (quoting Huddleston v. United \\nStates , 415 U.S. 814, 831 (1974), which had stated that the \\nCourt \"perceive[d] no grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in\" a \\nstatute before it, id., but did not suggest that \"grievous ambigu-\\nity\" was a threshold requirement for any reliance on lenity).  \\nThe rule of lenity itself goes back for centuries.

      "{'II. JUDICIAL EXPERIENCE WITH 18 U.S.C. section 924(e)(1) SUPPORTS APPLYING THE RULE OF LENITY': 'Petitioner\\'s brief ably sets forth why the Sixth \\nCircuit\\'s analysis finds no support in the ACCA\\'s \\ntext, history, or purpose.  FAMM agrees that this \\nCourt can and should reverse the judgment of the \\nSixth Circuit without resort to the rule of lenity or the principles that underlie it.

      "{'A. Entries of Separate Structures on a Single Day or Night Are Not Clearly Multiple Different \"Occasions\"': '1. The decision under review  is a useful starting \\npoint.  According to the Sixth Circuit, all 10 of Wooden\\'s 1997 convictions for burglary, which took \\nplace on a single night, were \"separate ACCA \\npredicate offenses\" that occurred on \"\\'occasions \\ndifferent from one another.\\'\"  JA21 (quoting 18 \\nU.S.C. § 924(e)(1)).  To support that conclusion, the court of appeals reasoned that, \"[w]hatever the \\ncontours of a \\'mini\\' wareho use, Wooden could not be \\nin two (let alone ten) of them  at once\"; that he \"could \\nhave ceased his criminal conduct\" after entering the \\nfirst warehouse without en tering nine more; and \\nthat, although \"one could characterize th[e] cluster of \\nwarehouses as being adjoined \\'at the same business location,\\'\" they were \"different locations\" because  \\ntheir owners had \"distinct se ts of property rights.\"  \\nJA23-24. \\nWooden argues persuasively (at 30) that the \\n\"textual foundations\" for the court of appeals\\' \"test \\n. . . are essentially nonexistent.\"  Even if the statute \\ndoes not wholly foreclose th at test, it certainly gives \\nno fair warning that unlawfully entering 10 small \\nwarehouses within the same building on a single \\nevening triggers a harsh 15-year penalty for later \\nowning a gun, while spending the same amount  \\nof time in a single warehouse would not.  The court  \\nof appeals\\' analysis thus  \"mak[es] criminal law  \\nin Congress\\'s stead.\"  Santos , 553 U.S. at 514 \\n(plurality).  At best it is judicial doctrine built up  \\nto cover the lack of clarity in the statute, rather  \\nthan anything that can claim to be an application of \\nthe statute itself.  Those who agree with Justice \\nScalia that \"it is not consistent with the rule of lenity \\n 21 \\nto construe a textually ambiguous penal statute \\nagainst a criminal defendant on the basis of legis-\\nlative history,\" R.L.C. , 503 U.S. at 307 (Scalia, J., \\nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment), \\ncan stop there, because the statute is at least \\ntextually ambiguous.   \\nThose who look to legislative history as an \\ninterpretive guide should reach the same ultimate \\nconclusion.  As Wooden persuasively shows (at 21-\\n25), that history ranges fr om an Assistant Attorney \\nGeneral\\'s 1984 testimony that the statute was meant \\nto catch \"people who have demonstrated . . . that \\nlocking them up and letting them go doesn\\'t do any \\ngood,\" Pet. Br. Add. 29a; to the Solicitor General\\'s 1987 concession in Petty that the statute was \\n\"intended\" to cover \"multiple criminal episodes,\" id. \\nat 26a; to then-Senator Biden\\'s 1988 statement that \\nthe statute was meant to \"express[] [a] concept of \\nwhat is meant by a \\'career criminal,\\'\" 134 Cong. Rec. S17,370 (daily ed. Nov. 10, 1988).  None of this \\nsuggests an intent – let alone a clear one – to \\nconsider multiple offenses on a single night to be a \\ncareer in crime because it took a few seconds to move \\nfrom one mini-warehouse to another within a cluster \\nof such warehouses. \\n2. The Fourth Circuit\\'s decision in United States \\nv. Carr , 592 F.3d 636 (4th Cir. 2010), illustrates the \\nsame point.  That case involved Daryl Carr, who possessed a firearm after previously pleading guilty \\nto 13 state-law charges of \"felony breaking or entering.\"  Id. at 638.  Those 13 offenses all took \\nplace on a single day in 2006 during which Carr broke into each of 13 \"different storage unit[s]\" at  \\nthe same street addres s (\"N.C. 32 South\").  Id.  The \\ncourt of appeals conceded that the offenses were \\n\"substantively the same and arguably had the same \\n 22 \\ncriminal objective,\" but it nevertheless found them  \\nto be \"separate and distinct criminal episodes.\"  Id.  \\nat 645.  It reasoned that  the storage units were \\n\"different locations\"; that mo st, though not all, of the \\noffenses had \"different victims\"; and that Carr \"had \\nthe opportunity . . . to cease and desist his criminal \\nbehavior\" between one storage unit and the next, \\nadding in a footnote that \"Carr simply could not have \\nbroken into or entered the 13 separate storage units simultaneously.\"  Id. at 645 & n.8 (citation omitted).\\n8 \\nIn that analysis, the Fourth Circuit asserted that \\nthe statutory \"\\'definition may be clear\\'\" but conceded \\nthat \"\\'the factual permutations surrounding the \\nACCA tend to create havoc\\'\"; that \"\\'courts have \\napplied a multiplicity of factors\\'\" in cases involving \\n§ 924(e); and that the \"analysis\" has a \"fluid nature.\"  Id. at 640 (quoting United States v. Letterlough ,  \\n63 F.3d 332, 335 (4th Cir.  1995)).  That sort of \\nassessment ought to be a warning sign in construing a criminal statute:  it calls to mind this Court\\'s \\nobservation in Johnson that \"pervasive disagreement \\nabout the nature of the inquiry one is supposed to \\nconduct and the kinds of factors one is supposed to \\nconsider\" is a sign of unacceptable vagueness.  576 \\nU.S. at 601.  The present case, to be sure, is not  \\na vagueness challenge.  But the rule of lenity – and  \\nthe \"constitutional principles underlying th[at] rule,\" \\nDavis , 139 S. Ct. at 2333 n. 8 – counsels against \\nadopting a line of authority whose own proponents \\nreport fluidity at best and havoc at worst. \\n                                                 \\n8 In another footnote, the Fourth Circuit noted that Carr had \\nother \"state convictions\" on different dates, at least one of which \\ninvolved \"assault by pointing a gun,\" Carr , 592 F.3d at 639 n.3, \\nbut did not analyze whether they  constituted ACCA predicates \\nor rely on them for its holding. \\n 23 \\n3. The Seventh Circuit\\'s decision in United States \\nv. Hudspeth , 42 F.3d 1015 (7th Cir. 1994) (en banc), \\ninvolved Thomas Hudspeth, who on one day in 1983 broke into three businesses – \"a doughnut shop, a dry \\ncleaners, and an insurance company.\"  Id. at 1018-19.  \\nThe businesses were in the same \"strip mall,\" id., \\nwhere the burglars made \"a hole through [a] shared wall\" and \"forced open the door\" connecting two of \\nthe businesses, id. at 1022.  The whole affair took \\n\"approximately thirty-five minutes.\"  Id. at 1018-19.  \\nA majority of the Seventh Circuit held that, because Hudspeth\\'s three offenses were \"committed sequen-\\ntially, against different victims, at different times, \\nand at different locations,\" they were \"clearly crimes \\n\\'committed on occasions different from one another.\\'\"  Id. at 1021. \\nOne concurrence reasoned that Hudspeth was \\n\"appropriately sentenced because . . . the record shows three separate crimes against separate victims \\nand not a single crime or criminal occasion (whatever that is).\"  Id. at 1025 (Bauer, J., concurring).  One \\npartial dissent noted that past decisions had \"grappl[ed] with the ambi guity of the ACCA\" and \\nnoted \"the malleability of the relevant terms,\" including the different-occasions language.  Id. at \\n1025-26 (Flaum, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Another, joined by  five of the 11 judges who \\nheard the case, agreed that the \"cold print of the \\nstatute books\" did not answ er the question before  \\nthe court and argued for interpreting § 924(e) as  \\na \"congressional mandate . . . to identify the true recidivist.\"  Id. at 1034, 1037 (Ripple, J., concurring \\nin part and dissenting in part).  \\nNone of the opinions in Hudspeth suggested \\napplying the rule of lenity.  Yet at least six members \\n 24 \\nof the en banc court – counting Judge Bauer, whose \\nconcurrence expressed marked frustration with the \\nstatutory language – appear to have found no answer \\nto the question before them in § 924(e).9  As judicial \\nexperience goes, that is further evidence that \\n\"Congress le[ft] to the Judiciary the task of imputing \\nto Congress an undeclared will,\" Bell, 349 U.S. at 83, \\nconcerning prior offenses that occur over a short \\nperiod of time in several adjacent structures.'}\n",
      "{'B. Evading or Resisting Arrest Does Not Clearly Involve Multiple Different \"Occasions\"': 'Another  situation that repeatedly arises under \\n§ 924(e) is an offense af ter which the defendant \\nevades or resists arrest.  A rule that focuses on \\nsequence in time treats evasion or resistance as a \\ndifferent \"occasion,\" because it is possible to imagine a point at which the defendant stops the first offense \\nand starts running.  But an ordinary person trying  \\nto figure out the meaning of the statute from its \\nwords would not likely reach that conclusion.  Nor  \\ndo the tools of statutory construction suggest that \\nCongress meant to treat such an offender as a career \\ncriminal deserving 15 years in prison. \\n1. In United States v. Schieman , 894 F.2d 909 \\n(7th Cir. 1990), David Schi eman received a 15-year \\nsentence based in part on prior convictions of \\nburglary and aggravated batte ry of a police officer.  \\nId. at 910.  As a partial dissent explained:  \\n                                                 \\n9 Hudspeth relied on police reports to determine the circum-\\nstances of prior offenses; Shepard v. United States , 544 U.S. 13, \\n16 (2005), later barred courts from considering police reports  \\nin applying § 924(e).  The Seventh Circuit has since cited  \\nHudspeth as \"abrogated\" at least in part by Shepard .  See, e.g., \\nUnited States v. Elliott , 703 F.3d 378, 384 n.3 (7th Cir. 2012). \\n 25 \\nSchieman committed a robbery, walked three \\nblocks away to make a telephone call [at a phone \\nbooth] to arrange transportation away from the \\nscene, and, in an attempt to evade apprehension, \\npushed a police officer at the phone booth.  The \\npushing incident occurred approximately five \\nminutes after the robbery. \\nId. at 913 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and \\ndissenting in part).  The majority reasoned that, \"[o]nce the original crime is complete, there is no \\nprincipled way to distinguish\" between a battery \\n\"within ten minutes of the burglary\" and one \"a day after the burglary.\"  Id. at  913 (majority). \\nOne giving the words \"different\" and \"occasion\" \\ntheir ordinary meaning might well think that both \\nSchieman\\'s burglary and his attempt to escape five \\nminutes later occurred on the same occasion.  One \\nthinking of the statute as an attempt to identify \\ncareer criminals would reach the same result.  And \\nthe Schieman court\\'s reasoning only emphasizes  \\nhow traditional principles of lenity support that conclusion.  The court took a case it thought clear \\n(escape a day later) and used it to resolve a case  \\nit thought unclear (escape five minutes later) by \\narguing the lack of a \"principled . . . distin[ction]\" \\nbetween the two.  But the felt need to invoke the day-after hypothetical itself shows that the statute does \\nnot speak clearly to the five -minute case.  The court\\'s \\nrole was therefore to limit the 15-year sanction to the \\ncase where it was unambiguously intended. \\n2. In United States v. Davidson , 527 F.3d 703 \\n(8th Cir. 2008), vacated in part on other grounds , 551 \\nF.3d 807 (8th Cir. 2008) (per curiam), Mark Davidson \\nwas sentenced under § 924(e)  based on prior convic-\\ntions that included an attempted domestic assault \\n 26 \\nand fleeing from a police officer who interrupted that \\nattempt with a traffic stop.  Id. at 707.  The Seventh \\nCircuit conceded that the \"pause between the two offenses was brief\" and that the crimes were \\ncommitted in \"rapid succession,\" but reasoned that  \\na \"moment of relative calm\" had occurred when  \\nthe officer stopped Davidson, creating \"a point of \\ndemarcation between episodes\" that justified treating \\nDavidson\\'s prior convictions as separate.  Id. at 710. \\nThe Davidson court candidly acknowledged that \\nthe circuits had \"struggled with th[e] problem\" of applying § 924(e) to resist ance or evasion offenses, \\n\"reaching arguably inconsistent results,\" id. at 709, \\ndiscussing Schieman and other examples.  Considered \\nas an exercise in the common-law method, the \"point of demarcation\" analysis that Davidson derived \\nmight not be exceptional.  But it has been settled \\nsince United States v. Hudson , 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 32 \\n(1812), that \"federal crimes . . . are solely creatures of \\nstatute,\" Liparota v. United States , 471 U.S. 419, 424 \\n(1985), a principle that lenity helps protect, see id. at \\n427-28.  And the distinction that Davidson and cases \\nlike it draw – if it can even be squared with the \\nstatute at all – is clearly a rule made by the courts \\nrather than one set down by statute. \\n3. In Levering v. United States , 890 F.3d 738 (8th \\nCir. 2018), Merwyn Leveri ng was sentenced under \\n§ 924(e) based on prior convictions that included at \\nleast two assaults in the cour se of a high-speed flight \\nfrom police officers in a stolen automobile.  Id. at \\n739.  Levering argued that the assaults were not committed on different occasions because the flight \\nwas a \"\\'continuous course of conduct.\\'\"  Id. at 741.  \\nThe Eighth Circuit acknowledged that \"the phrase \\n\\'continuous course of conduct\\' appears in our cases on \\n 27 \\nthis subject,\" but rejected  it as \"unhelpful to the \\nanalysis.\"  Id. at 742.  Instead, the court relied on the \\nfact that the assaults were committed \"at different times in different counties against different victims.\"  \\nId.  The Eighth Circuit acknowledged that several \\nunpublished decisions from the Sixth Circuit pointed \\nto a different result, but \"respectfully differ[ed]\" with them.  Id.   \\nLike the Fourth Circuit\\'s acknowledgment of \"havoc\" \\nin Carr , the vigorous disagreement among members \\nof the Seventh Circuit in Hudspeth , and the Eighth \\nCircuit\\'s own earlier acknowledgment of \"arguabl[e] \\ninconsisten[cy]\" in Davidson , the reasoning of \\nLevering points to the type of pervasive uncertainty \\nabout statutory application that suggests courts have gone beyond the guidance that an unclear statute \\ncan offer.  It is especially  telling that – as the Eighth \\nCircuit\\'s criticism of the Sixth Circuit shows – courts theoretically applying the sa me sequential test reach \\ndifferent results as to similarly situated defendants. \\n4. None of this is to deny that fleeing from arrest \\nand assaulting someone while doing so is not serious misconduct that state and sometimes federal law \\nproperly criminalize.  The police officer in Schieman \\ncould have been hurt, as could the bystanders to the \\nhigh-speed chases in Davidson and Levering .  Nor is \\nthere any doubt that after their prior convictions the \\nvarious defendants were prohibited from possessing guns, see 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), and could be punished \\nfor breaking that law.  The function of § 924(e), \\nhowever – as its text, structure, and history all show – is to carve out a special set of repeat offenders, \\nlabeled as \"armed career criminals,\" for special \\ncondemnation and harsh mandatory punishment.  It \\nis impossible to read the cases struggling with these \\n 28 \\nissues and conclude that the legislature has \"clearly \\nsaid\" that those defendants should \"languish[] in \\nprison,\" Bass , 404 U.S. at 348 (cit ation omitted), for \\nat least 15 years.'}\n"

No person \\nother than amici curiae or their counsel made a monetary \\ncontribution to its preparation or submission. Each party \\nconsented to the filing of this brief in accordance with Supreme \\nCourt Rule 37.3. \\n2 \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\nThe Sixth Circuit\\'s overly expansive interpretation of \\nthe Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\" or the \"Act\") \\nmandates disproportional and unconstitutional \\npunishment of juvenile offenders in violation of the \\nEighth Amendment. ACCA\\'s sentencing \\nenhancement provision explicitly applies to children \\nand includes certain juvenile delinquency \\nadjudications as qualifying predicates for imposition \\nof its mandatory minimum sentencing requirement. \\nThe Sixth Circuit\\'s broad construction of the \\n\"different occasions\" language of the Act sweeps even \\nmore juvenile conduct into ACCA\\'s domain further \\ncompromising the ability of the sentencer to consider \\nthe infirmities of youth and impose a constitutionally \\nproportional sentence. In expanding the reach of \\nACCA beyond the intent of Congress, the Sixth \\nCircuit paves the way for excessive and potentially \\nunconstitutional sentences for child offenders. This \\nerroneous interpretation presents an unacceptable \\nrisk of inflicting permanent, debilitating sentencing \\nconsequences on children that lack any legitimate \\npenological justification and is thus inconsistent with \\nthis Court\\'s prior rulings that children are different \\nfrom adults and these differences neccissitate \\nheightened constituitonal protections. \\nThis Court has examined the parameters of \\njuvenile culpability on multiple occasions, \\nconsistently holding that kids cannot be held \\naccountable according to adult standards because of \\ntheir underdeveloped brains The Court has \\nrepeatedly reaffirmed, as recently as this year, that \\nthe circumstances leading to juvenile crime are \\n3 \\ntransient, not permanent, and as such are \\ninconsistent with designation of a child as an \\n\"irredeemable, career criminal.\" Constitutionally \\nacceptable juvenile sentencing instead requires \\nconsideration of all the mitigating factors associated \\nwith youth in general, as well as the specific situation \\nof the offender, with rehabilitation as the primary \\ngoal. \\nThe Sixth Circuit\\'s expansive interpretation of \\nACCA, however, contravenes this directive as it \\nwould result in even more children entering \\nadulthood permanently branded as career criminals, \\nsolely as a result of conduct precipitated by their still \\ndeveloping brains. Tragically, the consequences of \\nthis fleeting state of neurophysiological development, \\nover which they have no control and which they will \\noutgrow, will persist, relegating them to an adult life \\nof diminished opportunities at best, and incontestible \\nfelonious status, at worst. \\nUnder the Sixth Circuit\\'s reading of ACCA\\'s \\n\"different occasions\" language, circumstances this \\nCourt has previously described as transient will \\ninstead become a permanent albatross around a \\nchild\\'s neck. A child who exercises poor judgement or \\nsuccombs to peer pressure as a result of cognitive \\nimmaturity, or who has been subject to abuse and \\nneglect, risks being deemed a career criminal in direct \\ncontradiction to what Congress intended. Adopting \\nthe Sixth Circuit\\'s interpretation of the Act would \\ngreatly increase the likelihood of an individual \\nqualifying for an enhancement under the Act even \\nbefore reaching adulthood. This additional stripping \\nof sentencers\\' discretion to consider the actual \\n4 \\ncircumstances triggering offenses committed by kids \\nundermines the rehabilitation goal of this Court\\'s \\njuvenile sentencing precedent. \\nBy allowing sequential actions ocurring on a single \\nnight, at a single location, and in furtherance of a \\nsingle criminal opportunity, to morph into \"career \\ncriminal\" status, the Sixth Circuit has directly \\ncontradicted the plain language and purpose of \\nACCA. The effects of this interpretation are \\nmagnified when children are involved. The statute \\nwas intended to protect the public against hardened, \\nveteran criminals, not children, regardless of the \\nseverity of the crimes they have committed during one \\nday or night of intemperate behavior. Equating an \\nindividual\\'s poor decision-making on a single night \\nwith perpetual and irredeemable criminality is \\nunjustified when applied to adults, and \\nunconscionable when applied to children. \\n5 \\nARGUMENT \\nI. AN EXPANSIVE INTERPRETATION OF THE \\nARMED CAREER CRIMINAL ACT WOULD BE \\nESPECIALLY HARMFUL TO CHILD \\nOFFENDERS. \\nCurrently, some circuits, including the Sixth, \\napply an unjustifiably expansive test to determine \\nwhether previous offenses meet the \"different \\noccasions\" requirement of ACCA. This interpretation \\nis particularly harmful when applied to children in \\nsubjecting even more of them to imposition of ACCA\\'s \\nmandatory 15-year sentencing enhancement \\nprovision than the more common sense reading of the \\nphrase entails. The enhancement would be triggered \\nby convictions for multiple offenses, as well as certain \\njuvenile delinquency determinations, even when the \\nprior transgressions were committed as part of the \\nsame criminal opportunity, conspiracy or spree. 2  \\nGiven the often impulsive behavior of children, \\nespecially adolescents, resulting from their under-\\ndeveloped brains, this analysis could result in child \\noffenders becoming career criminals based solely on \\none night\\'s improvident conduct. 3  \\n2  See, e.g., United States v. Longoria, 874 F.3d 1278 (11th Cir. \\n2017) (finding Adam Longoria was a career criminal based on \\ntwo sales of controlled substances and one count of conspiracy \\nrelated to the sales). \\nUnited States v. Chappel, 801 Fed. App\\'x 379, 383 (6th Cir. \\n2020); see also United States v. Moody, 770 F.3d 577, 580 (7th \\nCir. 2014) (citing Shepard v.

       " {\"A. Under the Sixth Circuit's Interpretation of the Statute, Minor Offenders Will Enter Adulthood as Career Criminals.\": 'ACCA does not allow for consideration of the \\ninfirmities of youth in its application of mandatory \\nsentence enhancements. ACCA further includes \\njuvenile adjudications as qualifying offenses, \\nexplicitly including in the definition of a conviction, \"a \\nfinding that a person has committed an act of juvenile \\ndelinquency involving a violent felony.\" 4  \\nACCA\\'s definition of a violent felony further \\nincludes an \"act of juvenile delinquency involving the \\nuse or carrying of a firearm, knife, or destructive \\ndevice that would be punishable by over one year of \\nimprisonment if committed by an adult.\" 5  There is \\n\"no authority to ignore [an otherwise qualified] \\nconviction because of its age or its underlying \\ncircumstances. Such considerations are \\nirrelevant . . . under the Act.\" 6  ACCA has, in fact, \\nbeen applied in cases where all of the predicate \\noffenses were committed by a juvenile offender. 7  \\ntime limitation supported by the language of the Armed Career \\nCriminal Act is that the predicate convictions be \\'previous.1. \\n18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(C). \\n18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2). \\n6  United States v.

ACCA prohibits lower \\ncourts from considering factors that have been \\ndeemed critical by this Court in its Eighth \\nAmendment jurisprudence when sentencing \\nindividuals whose predicate offenses accrued as \\njuveniles. Adoption of the Sixth Circuit\\'s expansive \\ninterpretation of ACCA\\'s \"different occasions\" \\nrequirement will exacerbate this situation leading to \\nextremely harsh sentences for even greater numbers \\nof minors who will be unjustifiably designated as \\n\"career criminals \" \\nAn estimated 76,000 children are prosecuted in \\nthe adult criminal justice system every year in the \\nUnited States. 8  It is difficult, however, to estimate \\nwith any degree of certainty how many individuals \\nare currently incarcerated for crimes they committed \\nas children. 9  As of June 27, 2020, data from the U.S. \\nSentencing Commission revealed that there were 437 \\nEighth Amendment where the defendant had a long rap sheet, \\nincluding the predicate offenses, all committed as a juvenile). \\n8  See Charles Puzzanchera, et al., Youth Younger than 18 \\nProsecuted in Criminal Court: National Estimate, 2015 Cases, \\nNat\\'l Center for Juvenile Justice (2018), available at, \\nhttp://www.cfyj.org/images/Transfer-estimate.pdf  (last accessed \\nMay 9, 2021). \\n9  This data is not readily accessible though there is pending \\nlegislation that would require this information to be maintained. \\nSee H.R. 2908, 117th Congress (2021). \\n8 \\noffenders in BOP custody who had been sentenced to \\n20 years or longer who were under the age of 21 at the \\ntime of sentencing. 10  \\nEven in the absence of precise numbers of \\npotentially affected individuals, the Sixth Circuit\\'s \\ninterpretation raises serious concerns about how \\nACCA could be applied to child offenders. The Act \\nexplicitly allows for prior adjudications in juvenile \\ncourt, as well as prior convictions in adult criminal \\ncourt, to count as predicate offenses.\" This raises a \\nmyriad of additional concerns for child offenders, not \\nthe least of which is that Texas, Wisconsin, and \\nGeorgia exclude 17 year-olds from juvenile court \\naltogether. 12  The practical implication of the practices \\nof these outlier jurisdictions is that an unarmed 17 \\nyear old who burglarizes 10 storage units at the same \\nstorage facility in the same evening would not be \\neligible for an ACCA enhancement in 47 states, but \\nunder the interpretation of the Sixth Circuit, would \\nbe so eligible in the states that exclude 17 year olds \\nfrom juvenile court. 13  \\nThis is just the beginning of what such an \\nerroneous interpretation of ACCA would mean for \\nchild offenders.

The construction of ACCA applied \\nby the Sixth Circuit and other courts affords juveniles \\nlike Mr. Houston-Sconiers and Mr. Blount with no \\nopportunity to learn from a single night\\'s mistakes \\nbefore carrying the permanent designation of a career \\ncriminal In the event that a child is convicted of \\nmultiple charges stemming from a single incident, as \\nin the case of the Petitioner, he or she could face the \\nprospect of being branded a career criminal and \\nsubject to the harsh mandatory minimum sentence \\nthat accompanies such a designation, an outcome that \\nis clearly at odds with this Court\\'s jurisprudence and \\nthe intent of Congress. \\n14  State v.

Youth is not a mere \\n\"chronological fact,\" but \"a time and condition of life \\nwhen a person may be most susceptible to influence \\nand to psychological damage.\" 17  This notion is \\nreflected in a broad array of societal mores limiting \\n16  18 U.S.C. § 924(0(2)(0. \\n17  Eddings v.

Simmons, 24  holding that the Eighth and \\nFourteenth Amendments bar the execution of \\ndefendants who were under 18 years of age at the \\ntime of their crime. The Court identified three \\ndifferences between adults and children that \\n\"demonstrate that juvenile offenders cannot with \\nreliability be classified among the worst offenders.\" 25  \\nFirst, the Court explained that a \"lack of maturity and \\nunderdeveloped sense of responsibility are found in \\nyouth more often than in adults and are more \\nunderstandable among the youth,\" resulting in \\n\"impetuous and ill-considered actions and \\ndecisions.\" 28  Second, the Court noted that children \\n\"are more vulnerable or susceptible to negative \\ninfluences and outside pressures, including peer \\npressure.\" 27  Third, and most critically in the context \\nof ACCA\\'s sentencing enhancement provision \\ntargeting irredeemable, \"career criminals,\" the Court \\nfound that \"the character of a juvenile is not as well \\nformed as that of an adult\" with \"more transitory, less \\nfixed\" personality traits. 28  \\n23  Id. at 835. \\n24  543 U.S. 551 (2005). \\n25  Id. at 569. \\n26  Id.

Florida, 32  \\nholding that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the \\nimposition of life without parole sentences for \\njuvenile, non-homicide offenders. The Graham Court \\nreaffirmed Ropeis rationale, embracing research on \\nchild brain development, included in submissions \\nfrom the American Medical Association and American \\nPsychological Association as amid, in finding that \\n\"developments in psychology and brain science \\ncontinue to show fundamental differences between \\n29  Id. \\n3° Id.

Quoting Roper, the Court \\nheld that \"[fit is difficult even for expert psychologists \\nto differentiate between the juvenile offender whose \\ncrime reflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity, \\nand the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects \\nirreparable corruption.\" 34  The Court also relied upon \\nthe \"special difficulties encountered by counsel in \\njuvenile representation\" with respect to juvenile \\nclients characterized by reduced ability to weigh long-\\nterm consequences, impulsiveness, and a reluctance \\nto trust defense counse1. 35  \\nIn Miller v. Alabama, 36  the Court again relied on \\nthese innate attributes of childhood to hold that the \\nEighth Amendment bars mandatory life \\nimprisonment without parole sentences for \\ndefendants who commit their crimes as children. \\nCiting post- Graham psychological studies, the Court \\nexplained that \"the science and social science \\nsupporting Roper\\'s and Graham\\'s conclusions have \\nbecome even stronger.\" 37  In Montgomery v. \\nLouisiana, 38  the Court held that Milleis rule applied \\nretroactively on state collateral review, again relying \\non the reasoning of Roper and Graham. Finally, just \\nthis year in Jones v. Mississippi, 39  the Court affirmed \\n\" Id. at 68. \\n34  Id. at 73-73. \\n35  Id. at 78-79. \\n\" 567 U.S. 460 (2012). \\n\" Id. at 472. \\n\" 577 U.S. 190,206-07 (2016). \\n39  No. 18-1259, slip op. at 8,593 U.S. (2021). \\n15 \\nMiller and the underlying rationale on which it was \\nbased.41  \\nRelying on current research into the development \\nof the adolescent brain, there is a movement among \\nstate courts and state legislatures barring mandatory \\nminimum sentences for child defendants regardless of \\nthe underlying offense. 40  At least two state supreme \\ncourts have issued rulings to prohibit mandatory \\nminimum sentences for juvenile offenders. 41  State \\nlegislatures are also increasingly enacting juvenile \\nsentencing reforms limiting, and even eliminating, \\nthe imposition of mandatory minimum sentences on \\nchildren in recognition of their not fully developed \\nneurophysiology. 42  \\nAlthough this case does rest upon an Eighth \\nAmendment analysis, this Court\\'s evolving line of \\nprecedent, concluding that youth matters in \\nsentencing, adds special considerations when an \\n41  Id. \\n° Suzanne S.

The empirical \\nresearch supporting the decades of relevant case law \\nconfirms that crimes committed by children are, in all \\nbut the rarest of cases, the product of a transient set \\nof circumstances that do not reflect immutable \\ncharacteristics of the child\\'s identity or predict the \\nchild\\'s future behavior. In conflict with this reality, \\nthe construction of ACCA adopted by the Sixth Circuit \\nbelow would unjustifiably broaden the group of \\nchildren deemed hardened, habitual offenders, \\nincapable of rehabilitation, and thus deserving of \\nACCA\\'s drastic mandatory sentencing enhancement, \\nyet premised solely on a single night of brash \\nbehavior. \\nThe empirically demonstrated differences between \\nthe child and adult brain \"render suspect any \\nconclusion that a juvenile falls among the worst \\noffenders\" 43  and thus could conceivably qualify as a \\n\"career criminal\" under ACCA. The entire premise of \\nACCA\\'s sentencing enhancement — of the \"critical \\nneed to target the habitual offender [and] incarcerate \\nunrehabilitative [sic] repeat violent felons for lengthy \\nperiods\"44  — is thus categorically inapplicable to \\njuveniles, especially when the qualifying prior \\ncriminal conduct took place on a single occasion, as \\nthat term is commonly understood, and does not \\nreflect \"repeat\" behavior in any sense of the term. \\n43  Id. (italics added) \\n44  134 Cong. Rec. 15,806-07 (1988) (statement of Sen. Specter). \\n17 \\nThis Court has found that \"[amn offender\\'s age is \\nrelevant to the Eighth Amendment, and criminal \\nprocedure laws that fail to take defendants\\' \\nyouthfulness into account at all would be flawed.\" 45  \\nMandatory minimum sentences for juvenile offenders \\nundermine the fundamental principle that the \\npurpose of juvenile punishment is rehabilitation. 46  \\nThe Miller Court recognized the importance of \\nconsidering the \"mitigating qualities of youth!\" 47  In \\nfact, the Court found that mitigating factors are more \\nrelevant in the cases of juvenile offenders than they \\nare in the case of adults. 48  Unfortunately, ACCA was \\nnot worded with such considerations in mind as its \\nfocus was on the \"worst of the worst.\" Thus, the \\nstatute\\'s lack of sentencing discretion precludes \\nconsideration of age and all of the factors identified \\nand deemed relevant in Miller. Accordingly, ACCA\\'s \\nbreadth should not in turn be augmented by an overly \\nexpansive reading of the \"different occasions\" \\nlanguage as adopted by the Sixth Circuit. \\nEight circuits apply the ACCA enhancement too \\nbroadly, finding it applicable when crimes are \\ncommitted at different moments, even when \\ncommitted sequentially at the same location and \\n45  Graham, 560 U.S. at 76.

EXPANSIVE INTERPRETATION OF THE \\nARMED CAREER CRIMINAL ACT \\nCONTRAVENES CONGRESSIONAL INTENT \\nAND SHOULD BE NARROWED. \\nUnder ACCA, a defendant convicted of possessing \\na firearm or ammunition in violation of federal law \\nfaces a significantly more severe punishment if he has \\nthree or more previous convictions for a \"violent \\nfelony\" or \"serious drug offense,\" or both, \"committed \\non occasions different from one another.\" 54  In the case \\nbelow, this enhancement caused Mr. Wooden to face \\na mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years in \\nprison, approximately seven times his Sentencing \\nGuidelines range of 21 to 27 months. \\nThe Act defines a violent felony as a felony \\ninvolving the \"use of physical force\" or burglary, \\n53  McElyea, 158 F.3d at 1021. \\n54  18 U.S.C. § 924(e). \\n20 \\narson, extortion, or one involving explosives. 55  The \\ndefinition was previously more expansive, until this \\nCourt invalidated its residual clause in Johnson v. \\nUnited States as confusing, unpredictable, uncertain, \\nand a violation of the Constitutional guarantee of due \\nprocess.56  A serious drug offense is defined as certain \\noffenses involving controlled substances with a \\nmaximum possible sentence of ten years or more. 57  \\nNotwithstanding the \"wide differences\" between the \\njuvenile and adult justice systems, 59  as previously \\ndiscussed, the Act explicitly permits certain \\n\"finding[s] that a person has committed an act of \\njuvenile delinquency\" to serve as a predicate for the \\nsentencing enhancement. 59  \\nWhile the Act defines which previous convictions \\nto consider, it does not specify when these offenses are \\ndeemed to be \"committed on occasions different from \\none another.\" 69  The determination of whether a \\nprevious conviction qualifies as a predicate offense \\nand whether to apply ACCA\\'s enhancement at all, as \\nin the present case, often depends on whether this \\nadditional statutory requirement is met . 51  \\n\" 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2). \\n56  Johnson v.

ACCA was Only Intended to Apply to the \\nNarrow Subset of Irredeemable Offenders \\nIdentified after Multiple Opportunities for \\nRehabilitation. \\nThe legislation that would become ACCA was \\nintroduced in 1981 by Senator Arlen Specter, of \\nPennsylvania, a former district attorney. 62  At the \\ntime, there was a growing recognition that a large \\npercentage of crime is committed by a very small \\npercentage of repeat offenders. 63  \\nOrdinarily, conviction for unlawful possession of a \\nfirearm under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) is subject to a \\nsentence between zero to ten years.\" Senator Specter \\nproposed to mandate life imprisonment without the \\npossibility of a suspended sentence for career \\ncriminals. 65  The final version of the Act mandated a \\nsentence of fifteen years to life. 66  This sentencing \\nenhancement is significant, ,as the mandatory \\nminimum of fifteen years is higher than the \\nmaximum sentence without the enhancement. 67  The \\nresult is that sentences for convictions under § 922(g) \\nfrom 2008 through 2012 without the ACCA \\nenhancement averaged 46 months, compared to an \\nS. 1688, 97th Cong.

Nov. 10, 1988) (remarks of Sen. \\nBiden)). \\n26 \\n\"intended to prevent counting simultaneous crimes \\nseparately.\" 85  \\nIn the present case, Mr. Wooden was considered a \\ncareer criminal due to ten counts of burglary in \\nGeorgia, occurring on the same date, at the same \\ntime, at the same address, and in the same manner at \\na mini-storage facility. 88  His conduct is not legally \\ndistinguishable from that of the defendant in Petty, \\nwhose erroneous decision was the acknowledged \\nimpetus for Congress amending ACCA to include the \\nlimiting provision. 87  Courts have a duty \"to give \\neffect, if possible, to every clause and word of a \\nstatute.\" 88  If this Court upholds the Sixth Circuit\\'s \\ninterpretation of the Act, it would fail to give meaning \\nto the \"different occasions\" clause added in 1988, a \\ndecision that could be most charitably characterized \\nas demonstrating \"that the legislature was ignorant \\nof the meaning of the language it employed.\" 89  \\nTo implement Congressional intent, and avoid \\ncreating career criminals based on criminal activity \\noccurring in an uninterrupted chain of events, the \\n\"different occasions\" language of ACCA must be given \\na narrow construction. ACCA was enacted to handle \\nthe small subset of especially dangerous criminals \\nwhose unrepentant conduct became apparent over \\ntime. Congress took a clear step after Petty to prevent \\n\" United States v. Pope, 132 F.3d 684, 692 (11th Cir. 1998). \\n86  Wooden, 945 F.3d at 505. \\n87  See Anti-Drug Abuse Act, supra at n.811; McElyea, 158 F.3d \\nat 1019-20. \\n88 Montclair v. Ramsdell, 107 U.S. 147, 152 (1882) (emphasis \\nadded). \\n89  Id. \\n27 \\nvarying state interpretations of a single criminal \\nopportunity, such as the situation presented in this \\ncase, from triggering application of ACCA\\'s \\nmandatory sentencing enhancement. \\nThe rule applied by the Sixth Circuit in this case \\nimpermissibly expands ACCA\\'s sentencing \\nenhancement intended only for \"repeat offenders,\" \\n\"revolving door offenders,\" \"habitual offenders,\" \\n\"recidivists,\" and the \"very worst offenders\" who are \\nbeyond rehabilitation, to potentially ensnare \\nindividuals, including children, who have engaged in \\ncriminal activity solely on a single day or night of \\ntheir lives. 90  This result eviscerates Congress\\' intent \\nin enacting ACCA. It is manifestly unjust when \\napplied to any defendant, but particularly odious \\nwhen applied to children. \\n9° See discussion supra Sections I.A.—I.B. \\n28'}]"

      "{'A. Text': 'xt \\n \\n Oklahoma\\'s claim that a Reservation was never established for the Nation in the Indian Territory is divorced from both text and history.  The \\nTreaty of 1866 expressly refers to the Nation\\'s \\nTerritory as a \"Reservation.\"  Art. IX, 14 Stat. 785, 788 (1866).  That was no slip of the pen, but rather reflected the defining characteristics of the Creek territory. \\n \\n The term \"reservation\" has long been \"used in the land law to describe any body of land reserved … from sale for any purpose.  It may be a military \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n6 \\n \\n reservation, or an Indian reservation ... [W]hen \\nCongress has once established a reservation, all tracts included within it remain a part of the reservation \\nuntil separated therefrom by Congress.\"  United \\nStates v. Celestine , 215 U.S. 278, 285 (1909). \\n  The statutory and treaty text creating a new \\nhomeland for the Nation establish that it readily \\nsatisfies this definition.  The Indian Removal Act of 1830 authorized the President to divide public domain lands into defined \"districts \" for tribes removing to \\nthe Indian territory.  § 1, 4 Stat. 411, 411-12.  It \\nfurther provided that the United States would \\n\"forever secure and guar anty\" such lands to the \\nremoved tribes, \"and if they prefer it … the United States will cause a patent … to be made and executed \\nto them for the same[.]\"  § 3, 4 Stat. at 412. \\n  Pursuant to the Act, the Treaty of 1832 provided that \"country west of the Mississippi shall be solemnly guarantied to the Creek Indians,\" and \\n\"also\" that \"a patent\" woul d issue once its boundaries \\nwere ascertained.  Art. XIV, 7 Stat. 366, 368.  Using precise geographic terms, the Treaty of 1833 then \"establish[ed] boundary lines which will secure a ... permanent home to the whole Creek nation,\" carving \\nthat home out of public domain lands that had been \\nceded to the United States by the Quapaw, 7 Stat. 176 (1818), and the Osage, 7 Stat. 183 (1818).  Preamble, art. II, 7 Stat. 417, 418-19.  The Treaty further \\nprovided that the United States would \"grant a \\npatent, in fee simple\" to the Nation.  Art. III, 7 Stat. \\nat 419.  That patent issued  in 1852, reiterating the \\n1833 boundaries verbatim.  Fee Patent, Aug. 11, 1852, Land Title Plant, Muscogee Creek Nation, Book \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n7 \\n \\n 1:748.  After ceding a tract of land to the Seminole \\nNation in 1856, art. I, 11 Stat. 699, 699 (1856), the Nation ceded the western half of its territory to the \\nUnited States in 1866, leaving it with what the Treaty \\ntermed \"the reduced Creek Reservation\" that is the subject of this case, art. IX, 14 Stat. at 788.  \\n These treaties, in sum, set aside lands from the \\npublic domain, and while reducing those lands over time, solemnly promised, in the words of the 1866 \\nTreaty, that the remaining territory would \"be forever set apart as a home for said Creek Nation[.]\"  Art. III, \\n14 Stat. at 786.  They ordained a reservation in the \\nclassic sense, and the 1866 Treaty called it precisely that.      Oklahoma argues that issuance of a fee patent \\nin 1852 divested the Creek territory of reservation \\nstatus.  But the rule nowhere exists that a tribe cannot possess fee title to a reservation.  As the National Congress of American Indians (\"NCAI\") well \\nexplains, nineteenth-century reservations rested on \\nvarious forms of land tenure, with many substantial reservations held by tribes in fee simple.  NCAI Br. 10-13.  Neither this Court nor Congress has deemed title determinative of reservation status, see, e.g., In \\nre New York Indians, 72 U.S. 761, 766-68 (1866) \\n(repeatedly referring to the Seneca Nation\\'s fee simple territories as \"res ervations\").  And in the \\nNation\\'s case any distinction was insubstantial, as its \\npatent was highly restricted:  The Nation could not \\nsell the lands, see 25 U.S.C. § 177, and the United \\nStates retained both a reversionary interest in and supervisory power over them, §§ 3, 7, 4 Stat. at 412; \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n8 \\n \\n see United States v. Creek Nation , 295 U.S. 103, 109-\\n10 (1935).  \\nIt was the treaties that  \"solemnly guarantied\" \\nthe Nation\\'s lands.  Art. XIII, 7 Stat. at 368.  Consistent with the Remo val Act provision that a \\npatent could \"also\" issue, the Creeks received one in \\naddition to, not in substi tution for, the treaty \\npromises.  See Mo., Kan. & Tex. Ry. Co. v. United \\nStates , 47 Ct. Cl. 59, 119 (1911) (Howry, J., \\nconcurring) (\"The patents re sted on treaties[.]\").  \\nIndeed, the 1866 Treaty makes no mention of the \\npatent in \"forever set[ting] apart … a home for said Creek Nation[.]\"  Art. III, 14 Stat. at 786.  It is not surprising, then, that th e patent argument was \\nrejected long ago: \\n \\nThe contention that the Creek Nation \\nis not now an Indian reservation is not tenable....  [N]or can it be successfully maintained that because the United \\nStates [gave the Nation] a fee-simple \\ntitle thereto ... it is not in [the] possession of the Creeks as an Indian reservation. \\n \\nMaxey v.

The Creek had better reason \\nthan most to insist on enhanced protection for treaty promises.  By the 1820s, vast treaty cessions had left them with a \"last enclave of ancestral lands\" in \\nAlabama.  United States v. Creek Nation , 476 F.2d \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n9 \\n \\n 1290, 1293 (Ct. Cl. 1973).  In 1829, Alabama asserted \\njurisdiction over those lands and settlers poured in.  Id. at 1292.  Despite an 1826 treaty that \\n\"guarantee[d]\" the lands to the Creek, art. 13, 7 Stat. \\n286, 288, executive branch officials claimed to be powerless to protect them and urged them to remove.  Creek Nation , 476 F.2d at 1293-94.  See also Grant \\nForeman, Indian Removal  108-09 (1953). \\n  The Removal Act, however, permitted removal only of such tribes \"as may choose\" to go, § 1, 4 Stat. \\nat 412, and the Creek declined.  Foreman at 108.  \\nIncreasing the pressure, Alabama criminalized the functioning of the Creek government in 1832.  Creek \\nNation , 476 F.2d at 1292.  Georgia had taken similar \\nactions against the Cherokee and, in January 1832, \\nthis Court declared such actions \"repugnant to the \\nconstitution.\"  Worcester v. Georgia,  31 U.S. 515, 520, \\n561 (1832).  But within weeks of that decision, Jackson Administration officials again told the Creek \\nthat the government would not protect them and that \\nthey should remove.     The Creek then signed the 1832 Treaty.  While it required them to cede their eastern lands, art. I, 7 \\nStat. at 366, it gave them the option to remain and \\ntake individual allotments within their former territory, art. II, 7 Stat. at 366.  Removal was \\nexplicitly voluntary, art. XII, 7 Stat. at 367.  And \\nshould they stay, the United States promised \\nprotection from \"[a]ll intrud ers.\"  Art. V, 7 Stat. at \\n366.  Hence, the Treaty would allow the Creek to \"remain on land which they held sacred.\"  Creek \\nNation , 476 F.2d at 1294 (quotation marks omitted).   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n10 \\n \\n  Or so they thought.  Once again the Creek \\nended up \"look[ing] in vain for their promised protection\" and their lands \"were quickly overrun….  \\nThe frauds were spectacular and widespread, making \\na mockery of the treaty[.]\"   Francis Paul Prucha, The \\nGreat Father  222 (1984).   Federal agents \"gave \\nthemselves little concern for the promises made to the \\nIndians[.]\"  Foreman at 113.  The intruders took \\nCreek land, shot their livestock, \"burnt and destroyed their houses and corn,\" and \"used violence to their persons.\"  Id. at 114.  The dispossessed Creeks \"still \\nrefused to leave[.]\"  Angie Debo, The Road to \\nDisappearance  100 (1941).  And so it came to pass that \\nin 1836 – in violation of Congress\\'s decree that removal would only be voluntary, the same promise made in the 1832 Treaty, and this Court\\'s decision in \\nWorcester  – the Creeks were rounded up by federal \\ntroops and forcibly removed to the west.  The story of the sufferings they endured on their journey need not be repeated here. \\n \\n It is not surprising that having experienced, at such enormous cost, the willingness of executive branch officials to disregard treaties, statutes, and judicial commands, the Creek insisted on as much \\nprotection as possible for their newly reserved lands.  \\nMore surprising is how Oklahoma distorts this history and argues that a patent intended to provide additional security for the Creek Reservation \\ndismantled it instead.  \"[I]t would be anomalous,\" to \\nsay the least, to hold \"that the treaties conferring upon the Creek Nation a title stronger  than the right \\nof occupancy have left the tribal land base with less \\nprotection, simply because fee title is not \\nformally held by the United States in trust for the \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n11 \\n \\n Tribe.\"  Indian Country, U.S.A., Inc. v. Oklahoma , 829 \\nF.2d 967, 975-76 (10th Cir. 1987).  A treaty is meant to be interpreted \"as the [treating tribe] originally \\nunderstood it ... – not in light of new lawyerly glosses \\nconjured up for litigation ... more than 150 years after the fact.\"  Wash. State Dep\\'t of Licensing v. Cougar \\nDen, Inc. , 139 S. Ct. 1000, 1019 (2019) (Gorsuch, J., \\nconcurring).  Oklahoma\\'s ar gument fails this test – \\nbadly – and should be rejected.  II. The Creek Allotment Act Preserved the \\nNation\\'s Reservation. \\n \\n Just as the underlying patent has no bearing \\non whether the Creek Reservation was established, it is likewise irrelevant to whether the Reservation was \\nlater disestablished.  Disestablishment cases \\ntypically involve statutes transforming communal tenure to individual ownership, and hence transforming the original patent.  Whether that patent was held by a tribe in  restricted fee or in trust \\nby the United States is of no moment.  The question \\nis whether Congress, in altering title within the reservation boundaries, also intended to change those \\nboundaries.  \"Once a block of land is set aside for an \\nIndian reservation and no matter what happens to \\nthe title of individual plots within the area, the entire block retains its reservat ion status until Congress \\nexplicitly indicates otherwise.\"  Solem v. Bartlett , 465 \\nU.S. 463, 470 (1984).  The key to that determination \\nis the language enacted by Congress. \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n12 \\n \\n A. Text \\n \\n While Congress need not use any particular \\nformulation to disestablish a reservation, this Court \\nhas drawn a sharp distinction between text evidencing a \"present and total surrender of all tribal interests,\" Parker , 136 S. Ct. at 1079 (quotation \\nmarks omitted) – including \"[e]xplicit reference to \\ncession\" or abolition of the reservation, \"language providing for the total surrender of tribal claims in exchange for a fixed payment,\" or language \"restor[ing reservation] land  to the public domain,\" id. \\n(quotation marks omitted) (b rackets in original) – and \\ntext simply allotting land among tribal members or \"allow[ing] \\'non-Indian settlers to own land on the reservation,\\'\" id. at 1080  (quoting Seymour v. \\nSuperintendent of Wash. State Penitentiary , 368 U.S. \\n351, 356 (1962).  The Creek Allotment Act of 1901, 31 Stat. 861, falls squarely in the latter category.   The Act allotted almost  all land within the \\nReservation to tribal members.  Section 3 provided \\nthat \"[a]ll lands of said tribe, except as herein \\nprovided, shall be allotted among the citizens of the \\ntribe ... to give each an equal share of the whole in \\nvalue,\" § 3, 31 Stat. at 862, with ensuing sections \\ndetailing the allotment process, §§ 4-9, 31 Stat. at 863-64.  The exceptions were limited.  Lands were reserved for tribal purposes, including schools, cemeteries, and churches.  § 24, 31 Stat. at 868-69.  In \\naddition, towns (occupied principally by noncitizens \\nwith no prior legal claim to Reservation lands, Johnson v. Riddle , 240 U.S. 467, 476-77 (1916)) were \\nto be platted and appraised, § 10, 31 Stat. at 864-66, \\nwith the owners of existing improvements \"hav[ing] \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n13 \\n \\n the right to purchase such lot[ s] by paying one-half of \\nthe appraised value thereof,\" § 11, 31 Stat. at 866, and remaining lots to be sold \"at public auction to the \\nhighest bidder,\" § 14, 31 Stat. at 866.  The proceeds \\nfrom these sales (which by definition were not fixed in sum) were to be paid \"into the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the tribe,\" § 31, 31 Stat. at 870. \\n \\n These provisions evidence no intent to disestablish the Reservation.  This Court has long held that allotment by itse lf simply tr ansforms the \\nnature of the landholdings within a reservation, and \\nhence that \"allotment ... is completely consistent with \\ncontinued reservation status.\"  Mattz v. Arnett, 412 \\nU.S. 481, 497 (1973); see also Celestine , 215 U.S. at \\n288.  The same is true for the townsite provisions, §§ \\n10-22, 31 Stat. at 864-67, which applied to a fraction \\nof the Reservation land base, 1911 Annual Report of the Comm\\'r to the Five Ci vilized Tribes, at 391,\\n2 and \\nfall squarely into Parker \\'s category of non-\\ndisestablishing statutes that \"merely opened reservation land to settlement and provided that the \\nuncertain future proceeds of settler purchases should \\nbe applied to the Indians\\' benefit,\" 136 S. Ct. at 1079-80 (quoting DeCoteau v. District Cty. Court for Tenth \\nJudicial Dist. , 420 U.S. 425, 448 (1975)); see also \\nSeymour , 368 U.S. at 359 (townsite provisions fully \\nconsistent with continued reservation status). \\n   The Act\\'s land provisions contrast sharply with the Treaties of 1832 and 1866, in which the Nation \\n\"cede[d]\" territory to the Unit ed States.  Art. I, 7 Stat. \\nat 366; art. III, 14 Stat. at 786; Resp. Murphy  Br. 25.  \\n \\n2 http://bit.ly/MCN-RCTFCT-1911 . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n14 \\n \\n In Parker , this Court  found that a similar contrast \\nbetween allotment act text and earlier treaty language \"undermine[d]\" Nebraska\\'s diminishment \\nclaim.  136 S. Ct. at 1080.  Moreover, Congress passed \\nacts, contemporaneous with the 1901 Act, that demonstrate that when Congress intended allotment to eradicate reservation boundaries it knew how to \\nsay so.  See, e.g., Act of Apr. 21, 1904, § 8, 33 Stat. 189, \\n217-18 (allotting Ponca and Otoe and Missouria reservations and providing \" further , That the \\nreservation lines of the said ... reservations … are \\nhereby, abolished; and the territory comprising said \\nreservations shall … become part of [three Oklahoma counties]\").  Mattz  cited this very provision in noting \\nthat \"Congress has used cl ear language of express \\ntermination when that result is desired,\" 412 U.S. at \\n504 n.22, and declaring that  \"[t]his being so, we are \\nnot inclined to infer an intent to terminate [a] reservation,\" id. at 504.  The same conclusion follows \\nhere. \\n \\n In fact, even stronger textual evidence of preservation exists because in the Allotment Act Congress expressly recognized the Nation\\'s continuing legislative authority over the Reservation.  \\nWhile Section 47 maintained the Curtis Act\\'s \\nabolition of the Creek courts, \"legislative jurisdiction …. is quite a separate matter from jurisdiction to adjudicate,\"  Hartford Fire  Ins. Co. v. California , 509 \\nU.S. 764, 813 (1993) (quotation marks omitted) \\n(Scalia, J., dissenting).  And Section 42 made plain that the Nation\\'s legislat ive authority persevered: \\n \\nNo act, ordinance, or resolution of the \\nnational council of the Creek Nation in \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n15 \\n \\n any manner affecting the lands of the \\ntribe, or of individuals after allotment, or the moneys or other property of the tribe, \\nor the citizens thereof ... shall be of any \\nvalidity until approv ed by the President \\nof the United States.

[I]f approved ... \\nit shall be published in at least two \\nnewspapers having a bona fide circulation in the Creek Nation.  \\n§ 42, 31 Stat. at 872. \\n \\n This provision evidences Congress\\'s clear understanding that in the wake of the Allotment Act the Nation would:  (1) retain legislative and executive \\nbranches of government, (2) which would continue to \\npass and approve acts, ordinances, and resolutions, (3) pertaining to a wide variety of issues, including (without limitation) tribal lands, moneys, and other property, and (4) applying to \"citizens\" (defined in \\nSection 1 of the Act as  Nation members) and \\n\"individuals.\"  The requirement that notice of new Nation laws be published \"in the Creek Nation,\" and the recognition that the Nation retained legislative jurisdiction over \"the lands … of individuals after \\nallotment,\" underscored that territorial borders \\nwould remain intact.  So too did Congress\\'s pledge in the following section that the United States would \"maintain strict laws in said nation … [regarding] \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n16 \\n \\n liquors or intoxicants,\" § 43, 31 Stat. at 872 (emphasis \\nadded).3 \\n \\nB.

The critical point is this:  In its statutory charge to the Dawes Commission, Congress sought allotment of a portion \\nof the Reservation to the Creeks and cession of any \\nsurplus.  Act of Mar. 3, 1893, § 16, 27 Stat. 612, 645-46.  But the Creek steadfastly opposed this plan.

The \\n \\n3 Subjecting Creek legislation to federal approval undermines \\nnone of this.  The treaties anticipated such oversight, see, e.g., \\nart. X, 14 Stat. at 788-89, which indeed became a staple of \\nfederal-tribal relations under the Indian Reorganization Act, 25 \\nU.S.C. §§ 5101-5144, Cohen\\'s Handbook of Federal Indian Law \\n§§ 4.04[3][a], 4.05[3], at 256-58, 271 (Nell Jessup Newton ed., \\n2012) (\"Cohen\").  And while Section 46 of the Allotment Act \\nprovided for the termination of the tribal government on March 4, 1906, it did so \"subject to su ch further legislat ion as Congress \\nmay deem proper.\"  § 46, 31 Stat. at 872.

      "{'C.

In Morris v. Hitchcock , 194 U.S. 384 (1904), the \\nChickasaw Nation, under a provision materially \\nidentical to Section 42, had enacted legislation \\n(enforced by the Secretary) regulating noncitizen activities within its reservation.  See id . at 391 and \\nn.1.  This Court affirmed the D.C. Circuit\\'s rejection \\nof a challenge to the law, stating that the Section 42-\\nlike provision was intended to permit the continued exercise of tribal legislative authority.  Id. at 393.  The \\ndecision favorably quoted a 1900 Opinion of Attorney General Griggs, id. at 392, which stated that \\npurchasers of tracts in the Five Tribes\\' reservations \\nremained subject to tribal jurisdiction \"within their \\nlimits.... even if the Indian title to the particular lots sold had been extinguished,\" 23 Op. Att\\'y Gen. 214, \\n216-17 (1900), 1900 WL 1001, at 2. \\n \\n5 http://bit.ly/MCN-1900-ARCFCT . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n18 \\n \\n  \\n The following year, in Buster v. Wright , 135 F. \\n947 (8th Cir. 1905), the Eighth Circuit applied \\nHitchcock directly to the Creek Nation, which had \\nenacted legislation (again enforced by the Secretary) imposing conditions on noncitizen owners of town sites for the \"privilege of trading within its borders[.]\"  \\nId. at 949.  \"Repeated decisions of the courts, \\nnumerous opinions of the Attorneys General, and the practice of years place[d] beyond debate\" that the Nation possessed authority to enact such legislation.  \\nId. (citing Hitchcock , 194 U.S. at 392).  That authority \\n\"remained in full force and effect after ... the agreement of 1901\" and was not diminished by \"the establishment of town sites nor the purchase ... by noncitizens of lots therein[.].\"  Id. at 953-54. \\n \\n These conclusions followed because, while Congress had significantly curtailed the Nation\\'s powers (including abolishing  its courts), \"[t]he fact \\nremains nevertheless that every original attribute of \\nthe government of the Creek Nation still exists intact which has not been destroyed or limited by act of Congress[.]\"   Id. at 950.  This Court continues to hew \\nto that cardinal principle today.  See, e.g., Puerto Rico \\nv. Sánchez Valle , 136 S. Ct. 1863, 1872 (2016) \\n(\"[U]nless ...

      "{'III. Congress Deliberately Preserved the Creek Nation and Its Reservation in the Five Tribes Act': '. \\n  \\nA. Text \\n \\n On March 2, 1906, as the conditional dissolution of the Nation\\'s government approached, \\nsee supra note 3, Congress extended its life through a \\nJoint Resolution providing that  \"the tribal existence and present tribal governme nts [of the Five Tribes] … \\nare hereby continued in full force and effect … until all property of said trib es, or the proceeds thereof, \\nshall be distributed among the individual members of \\nsaid tribes,\" 34 Stat. 822, 822.  By its plain terms this was wind-down authority – it preserved the governments until allotment was complete. \\n \\n \\npower to tax \"nonmembers for the privilege of doing business \\nwithin the reservation.\"  Id. at 332-33.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n20 \\n \\n  But Congress went much further in the Five \\nTribes Act, 34 Stat. 137 (1906), enacted a few weeks later.  While various provisions contemplate ultimate \\ndissolution, in Section 28 Congress continued the \\ntribes\\' existence and their governments indefinitely:  \\n[T]he tribal existence and present tribal \\ngovernments of the [Five Tribes] are \\nhereby continued in full force and effect for all purposes authorized by law ….  Provided , That no act, ordinance, or \\nresolution … of the … legislature of any \\nof said tribes … shall be of any validity \\nuntil approved by the President[.]  \\n§ 28, 34 Stat. at 148.   \\nThe State has argued that this too was simply \\na wind-up provision.  But \"we are always reluctant to assume a statute is so worthless that Congress was up to – literally – nothing when it bothered to labor \\nthrough the grueling process of bicameralism and \\npresentment.\"  Fletcher v. United States , 730 F.3d \\n1206, 1210 (10th Cir. 2013) (Gorsuch, J.).  If completion of the allotment process was the concern, the Joint Resolution already had addressed it.  \\nSection 28 sweeps more broadly.  It echoes Section 42 \\nin confirming that the Creek government would continue to pass \"act[s ], ordinance[s], or \\nresolution[s],\" and further recognizes that the \\ngovernment could act for \"all purposes authorized by \\nlaw[.]\"  § 28, 34 Stat. at 148.  This language was enacted against the backdrop of the Nation\\'s legislative authority over \"th e lands of the tribe\" and \\n\"of individuals after allotment\" expressly recognized \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n21 \\n \\n in Section 42 and confirmed in Hitchcock and Buster .  \\nIndeed, the textual parallels between Sections 42 and 28 underscore that Congress had the former squarely \\nin mind when it enacted the latter.  See Tiger v. W. \\nInv. Co. , 221 U.S. 286, 303 (1911) (referencing the \\n\"right of legislation\" preserved by Section 28). \\n \\n No language in the Five Tribes Act purports to \\nalter Reservation boundaries.  Section 16 provides that after allotment, \"the residue of lands in each of said nations not reserved or otherwise disposed of \\nshall be sold by the Secretary,\" with the \\nindeterminate proceeds credited to the respective nation.  § 16, 34 Stat. at 143.  This provision simply opened up surplus land on the Reservation for settlement, with no fixed sum in return, and hence \\nfalls squarely within the category Parker deems \\nexemplary of reservation preservation, 136 S. Ct. at 1079; see supra at 12-13.  Section 19 increased from 5 \\nto 25 years the period of inalienability for allotments \\nheld by any fullblood tribal member.  § 19, 34 Stat. at \\n144; Tiger , 221 U.S. at 306.  And Section 27 provided \\nthat, in the event of tribal dissolution, tribal lands would \"not become public lands nor property of the United States, but shall be held in trust by the United \\nStates for the benefit of the Indians[.]\"  § 27, 34 Stat. \\nat 148.  Taken separately or together, these provisions do not remotely evidence \"the present and total surrender of all tribal interests\" in the Reservation, \\nParker , 136 S. Ct. at 1079 (quotation marks omitted). \\n  In Murphy , Oklahoma suggested that the \\nprovisions in the Act restricting the powers of the tribal governments, including the elimination of \\ntribal taxing (though not of other revenue-raising) \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n22 \\n \\n authority, connoted disestablishment.  § 11, 34 Stat. \\n141.  But the principle that there exists no \"roving license\" to extrapolate from the congressional \\nrestriction of certain tribal powers the wholesale \\ncurtailment of others, Bay Mills , 572 U.S. at 794;  see \\nalso Buster , 135 F. at 949-50, has especial force where \\nthe claimed result is disestablishment.  Congress can \\nand has \"enact[ed] legislation that both restricts and, \\nin turn, relaxes … restrictions on tribal sovereign authority,\" resulting in \"major changes in the metes and bounds of tribal sovereignty\" over time.  United \\nStates v. Lara , 541 U.S. 193, 202 (2004).  But the \\nquantum of power exercised by a tribe within its borders has never been conflated with the separate question whether those borders continue to exist.  For while Congress can restore aspects of tribal \\nsovereignty previously curtailed, id., a historic Indian \\nreservation is unique in that once disestablished, its restoration would encounter obstacles legal, practical, and political that would effectively render the \\ndisestablishment permanent.  This Court\\'s insistence \\nthat Congress\\'s intent be clear before it will hold that Congress took the final step of disestablishing a reservation, Parker, 136 S. Ct. at 1079,  is accordingly \\ncritical not only to the protection of tribal powers but \\nalso to the protection of Congress\\'s prerogatives to \\nadjust them.  Oklahoma\\'s effort to infer from the loss of some territorial authority an intent to eliminate all \\nof it violates this core principle. \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n23'}\n",
      "{'B. Surrounding History and Missouri Railway': 'The surrounding history again confirms the \\ntextual conclusion.  The United States agrees with the Nation and Petitioner that  Section 28 was added to \\nthe Five Tribes Act late in the legislative process in \\nsignificant part because Congress realized that \\nrestoration of the Five Tribes\\' reservations to the public domain would result in a massive transfer of lands to two railroad companies.  U.S. Murphy Br. 27; \\nPetr. Br. 11, 28-29; Creek Murphy  Br. 17-19 (detailing \\nlegislative history).  Congress had conditionally granted the companies (whose successor in interest remains a going concern) millions of acres within the reservations.  See Mo., Kan., & Tex. Ry. Co. v. United \\nStates , 235 U.S. 37, 38 (1914); 47 Ct. Cl. at 85-89 \\n(Howry, J., concurring).  The grants would vest \"whenever the Indian title shall be extinguished\" and \"said lands become a part of the public lands of the \\nUnited States.\"  § 9, 14 Stat. 236, 238 (1866); § 9, 14 \\nStat. 289, 291 (1866); Mo., Kan., & Tex. Ry. , 235 U.S. \\nat 39.   The grants, in other words, would vest upon \\ndisestablishment .  See Parker , 136 S. Ct. at 1079 \\n(disestablishment occurs by \"extinguish[ing] the land\\'s prior use ... as an Indian reservation – and ... return[ing] it to the United States\"); see also  id. at \\n1080 (\"to restore land to the public domain was to \\nextinguish the land\\'s prior use.\").  Congress focused squarely on this point in its deliberations over Section 28, and continued the Creek and other governments \\nwith the specific in tent of avoiding that result.  Petr. \\nBr. 11, 28-29; Creek Murphy Br. 17-19. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n24 \\n \\n  This prompted suit by one of the railroads.  The \\nsuit reached this Court, which in a unanimous opinion by Justice Holmes rejected the claim in a \\nholding in serious tension with the State\\'s arguments \\nhere:  \\nOn this literal reading of the [grant] the \\nconditions have not been fulfilled.  The \\nland has remained continuously appropriated to the use of the Indians, or has been sold for their benefit.  It \\nnever for a moment has become a part of \\nthe public domain in the ordinary \\nsense ....  [W]e cannot read [the grant] as \\npreventing the United States from making the change from tribal to \\nseveral possessions, or dealing with this \\nland in any way deemed most beneficial for those whose rights were treated as paramount.  The proviso that the land must become public land shows that a \\nmere change from tribal title was not \\nenough . \\n \\n235 U.S. at 40 (emphases added).  In reaching this \\nconclusion this Court cited both the Five Tribes Act \\nand the Creek Allotment Act as \"show[ing] in express \\nterms\" that the tribal lands had not been returned to the public domain and hence that the railroads\\' rights \\nhad not vested.  Id. at 41.  The opinion betrays no \\nunderstanding that these st atutes had instead been \\nthe capstones of a project to dismantle the Reservation.    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n25'}\n",
      "{'IV. Statehood Did Not Eradicate the Reservation Boundaries': '. \\n \\nA. Text \\n \\n Oklahoma has credited statehood as central to \\nthe inexorable march to disestablishment.  This \\nargument again runs headlong into text.  Just last \\nTerm, this Court reaffirmed that \"[t]reaty rights ... \\nare not impliedly terminated upon statehood.\"  Herrera v. Wyoming, 139 S. Ct. 1686, 1696 (2019) \\n(quoting Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa \\nIndians , 526 U.S. 172, 207 (1999)).  \"Statehood is \\nirrelevant ... unless a statehood Act otherwise demonstrates Congress\\' clea r intent to abrogate a \\ntreaty[.]\"  Id. \\n \\n  The Oklahoma Enabling Act evidences no such \\nintent.  Congress did not countenance the alteration of tribal boundaries in the Ac t.  Instead, the very first \\nsection of the Act provides: \\n \\nThat nothing contained in the [Oklahoma] constitution shall be construed  to limit or impair the rights \\nof person or property pertaining to the \\nIndians of said Territories (so long as such rights shall remain unextinguished) or to limit or affect the authority of the Government of the \\nUnited States to make any law or \\nregulation respecting such Indians, their lands, property, or other rights by treaties, agreement, law, or otherwise, \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n26 \\n \\n which it would have been competent to \\nmake if this Act had never been passed. \\n \\n§ 1, 34 Stat. 267, 267-68 (1906).  Oklahoma, moreover, \\nwas required to \"forever disc laim all right and title ... \\nto all lands ... owned or held by any Indian, tribe, or nation[.]\"  § 3, 34 Stat. at 270.  Far from using \\nstatehood as a vehicle to dismantle the Reservation, \\nthen, \"Congress was careful to preserve the authority of … the United States over the Indians, their lands and property, which it had prior to the passage of the [Enabling] act.\"  Tiger , 221 U.S. at 309. \\n \\nB. Surrounding History  \\n That Congress did not understand it to be necessary to abrogate the Reservation at statehood is \\nnot surprising.  As  Petitioner details, ample precedent \\nexisted for the admission of states with sizable reservations intact.  Indeed, not only was South Dakota admitted with forty-seven percent of its land \\nin reservation status, Petr. Br. 38, but the Cheyenne \\nRiver Sioux Reservation, confirmed by this Court in Solem , was set aside by Congress in March 1889, 25 \\nStat. 888, immediately on the eve of statehood in November of that year.   \\n \\n This understanding was on display again, just five days after enactment of the Oklahoma Enabling \\nAct, when Congress passed the Act of June 21, 1906, \\n34 Stat. 325.  There, Congress sought to resolve a \\nboundary dispute by \"declar[ing]\" an 1871 survey line mandated by the Treaty of 1866 \"to be the west \\nboundary line of the Creek Nation ,\" 34 Stat. at 364 \\n(emphasis added), and established a judicial \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n27 \\n \\n recording district with reference to the \"north line of \\nthe Creek Nation,\" id. at 343.  This would have been \\nstrange language for Cong ress to use had it just \\ndismantled the Creek Nation, especially given that in \\nthe same statute it made reference to \"what was formerly the north half of the Colville Indian Reservation,\" id. at 379.'}\n",
      "{\"C. The United States' Criminal Transfer Argument Lacks Textual Basis\": '. \\n \\n The United States (joined by the State) has \\nargued that various statutory provisions, including the criminal transfer provisions in the Enabling Act, conveyed criminal jurisdiction  over the Reservation to \\nthe State.  If that had happe ned, it would not by itself \\nhave been inconsistent with reservation status, and the Nation would accept Congress\\'s edict and move on.  But \"[t]he trouble is, nothing in the statute says anything like that.\"  SAS Inst., Inc. v. Iancu, 138 S. \\nCt. 1348, 1355 (2018).  Petitioner well explains why \\nnone of the provisions cited by the United States comes close to evidencing the clear intent necessary to transfer crimina l jurisdiction over Creek members \\nto the new State.  The Nation will not repeat that \\nanalysis, but wishes to emphasize two central points.     The United States argues that before statehood a series of territorial laws resulted in Indians and \\nnon-Indians being tried under the same laws in the \\nsame courts.  Any outcome, it posits, in which non-Indians and Indians would have been tried in different courts post-statehood would have altered the status quo and would have required legislation to \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n28 \\n \\n that effect.  But this ignores the fact that the courts \\nin which Indians and non-Indians were tried pre-statehood were federal (territorial) courts, and the \\nlaw applied was federal law.  That statehood would \\ntransfer non-Indians to state court jurisdiction was long-settled law.  United States v. McBratney, 104 \\nU.S. 621, 624 (1881).  But subjecting tribal members \\nto state jurisdiction would have marked a dramatic \\nchange in the status quo, one this Court has countenanced only where Congress \"has expressly provided that State laws shall apply,\" Washington v. \\nConfederated Bands and Tribes of Yakima Indian \\nNation , 439 U.S. 463, 470-71 (1979) (quotation marks \\nomitted).  The Enabling Act did nothing of the sort.   The lack of regard for text manifests itself in an \\neven more fundamental way.  In  Murphy, the State \\nand the United States urged this Court to disestablish the Reservation even if it agreed with their reading of the Enabling Act\\'s jurisdictional transfer provisions.  Okla. Murphy Suppl. Br. 8; U.S. Murphy Suppl. Br. \\n18 n.5.  But if those provis ions truly operate as they \\nsay, there would be no warrant for going beyond them to address disestablishment in this case.  Congress would have transferred criminal authority over the \\nCreek Reservation to the State, as it has done with \\nrespect to other reservations, see, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § \\n1162; 25 U.S.C. § 232, and whether the Reservation has retained its status would properly be a question \\nfor another day.  Only because text is ultimately \\nincidental to their arguments can the State and the United States claim otherwise.  \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n29 \\n \\n  I t  i s  n o t  s u r p r i s i n g  t h a t  a t  o r a l  a r g u m e n t  i n  \\nMurphy the State could not identify the date (that is, \\nthe statutory enactment) when disestablishment \\noccurred.  Murphy  Arg. Tr. 5-6.  One does not exist.  \\nAs the Tenth Circuit recognized three decades ago:  \\nAlthough Congress at one time may have \\nenvisioned the termination of the Creek \\nNation and complete divestiture of its territorial sovereignty, the legislation enacted in 1906 reveals that Congress decided not to implement that goal, and \\ninstead explicitly perpetuated the Creek \\nNation and recognized its continuing legislative authority….   It is not for the \\ncourts to complete a task that Congress \\nchose not to finish. \\n \\nIndian Country , 829 F.2d at 981.'}\n",
      "{\"V. The Nation's Post-Statehood Presence and Exercise of Governmental Power Confirm the Continued Existence of Its Reservation\": '. \\n \\n In Parker , the Omaha Tribe had been \"almost \\nentirely absent from the disputed territory for more than 120 years.\"  136 S.

Id.  \\nAnd \"for more than a century\" the federal government \\nhad \"treated the disputed land as Nebraska\\'s.\"  Id. at \\n1082.

(quotation marks omitted). \\n \\n These principles apply with even greater force \\nhere.  Contrary to facts at play in Parker , the Nation \\nand its members have maintained a significant and continuous presence throughout the Reservation ever \\nsince statehood, and the Nation exercises substantial \\ngovernmental authority for the benefit of all Reservation residents.

The contention \\nfalters in conflating the quantum of governance with \\nthe existence of reservation boundaries.  Supra  at 22.  \\n  \\nMoreover, Oklahoma understated Creek \\ngovernance within the Reservation during this \\nperiod.   Congress well understood that the Nation \\nretained legislative authority.  Hence, in 1909, \\nCongress made approval by the \"Creek National \\nCouncil\" a \"condition precedent\" to congressional \\nlegislation seeking to equalize the value of Creek \\nallotments throughout the Reservation.  35 Stat. 781, \\n805.  The Creek Council continued to enact laws and \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n31 \\n \\n submit them for presidential approval, including laws \\nregarding appropriations; the conduct of Council \\nmembers; the restructuring of government offices; \\nand the naming of delegates for a diplomatic mission \\nto Washington .7   \\n \\nAs Petitioner describes, the Nation and its \\nmembers endured a sustained,  illegal assault on their \\nlandholdings during this period.

Not \\nsurprisingly, the Creek government\\'s efforts focused \\non turning back that assault wherever possible, even \\nas the Interior Department frequently turned a blind \\neye, or worse yet, joined in the plunder.

The \\nNation directed its National Attorneys  to investigate \\nand litigate fraudulent town lot sales and \\nembezzlement in probate and guardianship matters.  \\nSee, e.g., 1907 Annual Report of the Indian Inspector \\nfor Indian Territory, at 369; 1908 Annual Report of \\nthe Comm\\'r of Indian Affairs, at 111-12; 1909 Annual \\nReport of the Comm\\'r to the Five Civilized Tribes, at \\n421; 1915 Annual Report of the Superintendent for \\nthe Five Civilized Tribes, at 412-13.8  Moreover, \\nunder a 1924 statute authorizing \"the Creek Indian \\nNation\" to bring treaty cl aims against the United \\nStates, 43 Stat. 139, 139, the Nation successfully sued \\nthe government for taking lands in violation of the \\n1866 Treaty  – hardly the act of a defunct sovereign.  \\nSee United States v.

For the second \\ntime in less than a century executive branch officials waged an all-out war on the Creek and sought to crush their governmental institutions – not in \\nfurtherance of Congress\\'s design but rather in \\ncontravention of it.     \\n Moreover, the early twentieth-century assault \\nwas hardly unique to the Nation or to Oklahoma.  \\nDepartmental policy nationwide sought \" to end the \\ntribe as a separate political and cultural unit\" to \"assure that … Indian civili zation died[.]\"  Cohen, \\nsupra  note 3, § 1.04, at 75.  If the lack of governance \\nduring this assimilationist era was a hallmark of \\ndisestablishment, very few reservations would \\nremain.   \\n In congressional debates leading up to the \\nIndian Reorganization Act of 1934 (\"IRA\"), \\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs John Collier described Interior control of reservations during the assimilationist era as \"adm inistrative absolutism.\"  \\nReadjustment of Indian Affairs: Hearing on H.R. 7902 \\nBefore the H.

In the changed climate, the Creek sought permission in 1934 to conduct their first tribal \\nelection since 1906, and Commissioner Collier \\nconsented.\\n11   \\n \\n The new era, however, was short-lived.  As \\nearly as \"the late 1930s,\" the seeds were sown for the \\nTermination era, \"the most concerted drive against \\nIndian property and Indian survival since the \\nremovals following the act of 1830 and the liquidation \\nof tribes and reservations following 1887.\"  Cohen, \\nsupra  note 3, § 1.06, at 85 (quotation marks omitted).  \\nDuring this period, which peaked in the post-war \\nyears, federal officials agai n sought \"the abolition of \\ntribal self-government\" and engaged in \"unauthorized \\nauthoritarianism on Indian reservations.\"  Felix S. \\nCohen, The Erosion of Indian Rights, 1950 –1953: A \\nCase Study in Bureaucracy , 62 Yale L.J. 348, 357, 361 \\n(1953).

The Nation is the fourth most populous Indian nation in the United States, with 89,271 \\ncitizens.\\n14  Nation members live throughout the \\nReservation.15  Under the Nation\\'s Constitution, the \\nReservation is divided into eight legislative districts, each of which serves as a home voting district for Nation citizens and sends two representatives to the \\nNational Council.  MCN Const. art. IV, § 9; art. VI, §§ \\n1-2.\\n16 \\n  The Constitution main tains the tripartite, \\nseparation-of-powers governme nt first established in \\n1867, with a democratically elected Principal Chief, \\nSecond Chief, and National Council, and a judiciary appointed by the executive branch and confirmed by the legislature.

The Nation \\nis party to an Intergovernmental Cross-Deputization Agreement with the United St ates and virtually all of \\nthe counties and munici palities within the \\nReservation, including both the City and County of \\nTulsa.\\n18  Pursuant to the agr eement, the Lighthorse \\nrespond to criminal and emergency situations throughout the Reservation, regardless of the Indian or non-Indian status of those involved, and regardless of the fee or trust status  of the lands where the \\nincidents arise.  Given the sophistication of both its \\nregular and specialized units, the Lighthorse are frequently called on to a ssist other law enforcement \\nagencies, including in the more rural areas of the \\nReservation; that cooperation has yielded notable \\nsuccesses and numerous accolades for the Department.\\n19  A vivid example occurred just days \\nbefore the filing of this brief, when the Lighthorse received a request from the Okfuskee County Sheriff\\'s \\nOffice and the Oklahoma State Bureau of \\nInvestigations to search for the suspect in a double homicide and arson.

In 2019, the he alth-care system operated \\nby the Nation\\'s Department of Health provided a full \\narray of medical services for more than 180,000 patient visits at its three state-of-the-art hospitals (all \\n \\n20 http://bit.ly/MCN-Lighthorse-Arrest-Feb-6-2020 .   \\n21 See, e.g. , http://bit.ly/MCN-Transpor tation-Agreement-Lamar-\\nRoad ; http://bit.ly/MCN-DOT-Meeting ; http://bit.ly/MCN-\\nTransportation-Agreements .    \\n22 http://bit.ly/MCN-Transportation-Project-Mission-Road .    \\n23 http://bit.ly/MCN-Transportation-BIA-Letter-of-Support .    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n39 \\n \\n in rural areas and servin g both Indians and non-\\nIndians) and six medical clinics,24 with the Nation \\nhaving invested more than $85 million in these \\nfacilities in recent years.25  The Nation\\'s Family \\nViolence Prevention Program (\"FVPP\") provides significant assistance to victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking.\\n26  The FVPP (widely \\nrecognized by police departments, state court judges, \\nthe U.S. Department of Justice, and others for the quality and importance of its efforts)\\n27 serves Indian \\nand non-Indian clients alike, and in many areas of the Reservation is the only agency to provide such \\nservices.\\n28  The Nation also makes vital contributions \\nto education on the Reservat ion, operating Head Start \\nand WIC programs (again for Indians and non-Indians alike)\\n29 and partnering through its \\nDepartment of Education with local school districts \\nand the Oklahoma Department of Education to \\nimprove educational outcomes for all students.30 \\n  The Reservation-wide presence of the Nation\\'s \\ngovernment evidences itself in ways going beyond the \\nimportant programs it offers.  \"The territorial jurisdiction of the Muscogee Courts ... extend[s] to all \\n \\n24 http://bit.ly/MCN-Dept-of-Health  (\"Hospitals\" and \"Clinics\"); \\nhttp://bit.ly/MCN-First-Quarter-Report-2020 , at 6-7. \\n25 http://bit.ly/MCN-Construction-Projects-Report ; \\nhttp://bit.ly/CreekNation-ER-Expansion . \\n26 http://bit.ly/family-violence-prevention .  \\n27 See http://bit.ly/MCN-FVPP-Letters-of-Support ; Creek \\nMurphy Br. 28-29.  \\n28 http://bit.ly/MCN-FVPP-Clients ; http://bit.ly/FVPP-Map .   \\n29 http://bit.ly/MCN-Head-Start ; http://www.mcn-\\nnsn.gov/services/wic/ .   \\n30 http://bit.ly/MCN-First-Quarter-Report-2020 , at 11-13; \\nhttp://bit.ly/MCN-Education-Collaborative-Workshop . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n40 \\n \\n the territory defined in the 1866 Treaty with the \\nUnited States,\" MCN Code tit. 27, § 1-102(a),31 and \\nthe Nation\\'s courts accordingly exercise jurisdiction \\nover causes of action invo lving tribal members that \\narise within the Reservation\\'s boundaries, including on fee lands, see Walker v.

      "{\"VI. The State's Exaggerated Arguments About Consequences Provide No Support for Disestablishment\": '. \\n \\n In Murphy , the State and its amici, including \\nthe United States, suggested a host of consequences that would follow if this Court were to allow the \\nReservation to remain in place.  These suggestions \\nshare three things in common: (1) they are addressed to the wrong branch of government; (2) they are \\noverstated, and overlook entirely the significant intergovernmental cooperation already in place; and \\n(3) they fail to account for the disruption in \\ngovernance that would result if the Reservation were disestablished.'}\n",
      "{'A. Criminal Consequences': 'In Murphy , the Nation suggested that in the \\nevent of an affirmance, it would continue to explore with the United States, the State, and Congress the \\noptimal allocation of crimi nal jurisdiction on the \\nReservation.  The United States seized on this as an \"effective[] acknowledg[ment] … that affirmance would constitute a sea change[.]\"  U.S. Murphy  Suppl. \\nBr. 7.  Not so.  The Nation has no hesitation in \\nreiterating what it said previously:  It has a paramount interest in maintaining law and order within its Reservation, and firmly believes that, if there are adjustments to be made to criminal \\njurisdiction, then Congress is the constitutionally \\nempowered body to do so.  \"[I]n our constitutional order the job of writing new laws belongs to Congress, not the courts.\"  Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC , 138 S. Ct. \\n1386, 1413 (2018) (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  Ample \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n42 \\n \\n precedent exists for congressional action in this area.  \\nU.S. Att\\'ys Murphy Br. 6-9; Creek Murphy  Suppl. Br. \\n8-10. \\n \\n The United States and Oklahoma argued that \\neven if criminal jurisdictional issues are addressed in a satisfactory manner going forward, affirming the \\nNation\\'s reservation status would \"open the \\nfloodgates to countless attack s on convictions,\" Okla. \\nMurphy  Suppl. Reply Br. 8.  But federal habeas \\npetitions must be filed within one year, 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d), with strict limitations on second or \\nsuccessive petitions, id. § 2244(b).  The Tenth Circuit \\nhas already determined that Murphy provides no \\nbasis for overcoming these limitations.  See Dopp v. \\nMartin , 750 F. App\\'x 754, 757 (10th Cir. 2018); Boyd \\nv. Martin , 747 F. App\\'x 712, 716-17 (10th Cir. 2018).  \\n  Petitioner, who has a clear self-interest in making the argument, and Oklahoma, which has \\nperhaps a short-sighted one, contend that there are \\nno analogous barriers in the State system.  Petr. Br. 43 & n.5; Okla. Murphy  Suppl. Reply Br. 7; see also  \\nWackerly v. State , 237 P.3d 795, 797 (Okla. Crim. App. \\n2010).  But in an unpublished opinion the State Court \\nof Criminal Appeals has already found at least one Murphy  claim \"waived and procedurally barred.\"  \\nJohnson v. Oklahoma , No. PC-2018-343 (Okla. Crim. \\nApp. July 24, 2018).  And while Petitioner\\'s case is of \\ncourse before this Court, the decision below can fairly be described as a judicial curiosity:  Rather than holding Petitioner\\'s claim, it denied it on the grounds that this Court had not yet decided Murphy , and in \\ndoing so did not squarely address procedural bars.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n43 \\n \\n The Oklahoma courts plainly have unfinished \\nbusiness in this area.  \\n Moreover, if any State prisoners ultimately \\nsucceed in challenging their convictions, they would be subject to re-prosecution by the United States, see \\nUnited States v. Magnan , 863 F.3d 1284, 1291 (10th \\nCir. 2017), and the Nation.  The Nation understands \\nthat various factors will come  into play in making re-\\nprosecution decisions, but surely the existence of such factors does not suffice to disestablish a Reservation over a century after Congress made a concerted \\ndecision not to do so.'}\n",
      "{'B. Civil Consequences': 'Claims of significan t disruption from the \\nvindication of the Reservation\\'s boundaries cannot be sustained in light of on-the-ground reality and this Court\\'s precedents.  \"[M]illions of acres … [of] non-Indian fee land,\" Atkinson Trading Co. v. Shirley, 532 \\nU.S. 645, 648 (2001), exist within reservations across \\nthe country.  As NCAI well explains, these include sizeable portions of largely non-Indian cities like Tacoma, Washington that have thrived with the \\naffirmation of reservation status and the \\nopportunities for economic development that it brings.  NCAI Br. 25-29.   This Court\\'s precedents render hollow any \\nclaims of civil legal disrup tion as they presumptively \\nconstrain the exercise of tribal authority over non-Indians on fee lands (in areas ranging from regulation to taxation to adjudication ) while providing that the \\ncorollary state authority remains intact.  Id. 26; Creek \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n44 \\n \\n Murphy Br. 31-36.  Even with respect to on-\\nreservation tribal members, Oklahoma retains considerable power, including the authority to levy \\nproperty taxes on fee land.  Id. 35-36.  An Oklahoma-\\nspecific tribal statute (of which there are many) precludes any argument that the Nation could usurp state environmental regulation on the Reservation.  \\nPub. L. No. 109-59, § 10211(a)-(b), 119 Stat. 1144, \\n1937 (2005).  And claims of disruption appear particularly misplaced given the extensive intergovernmental cooperation between the State and tribes in eastern Oklahoma, Boren et al. Murphy  Br., \\nincluding the Nation in particular.  See supra at 37-\\n39.   With so little to aim at, Oklahoma trained \\nconsiderable rhetorical fire in Murphy on the Indian \\nChild Welfare Act of 1978, 25 U.S.C. §§ 1901 et seq. , \\nclaiming that child custody determinations would be undone in the event of an affirmance.  Okla. Murphy  \\nBr. 56.  This was unfortunate.  A far better indicator \\nregarding State-Nation cooperation under ICWA \\ncomes in a brief filed recently by Oklahoma and twenty-five other states in support of the Act\\'s constitutionality.  That brief emphasizes that \"ICWA \\ncreates an important framework that has allowed \\nrobust state-tribal collaboration in improving the health and welfare of Indian children.  Amici States have employed ICWA as a means of strengthening \\nand deepening their important, government-to-\\ngovernment relationships with  tribes in this critical \\narea.\"\\n33 \\n \\n \\n33 http://bit.ly/MCN-States-Amicus-Brief-ICWA , at 25.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n45 \\n \\n  This captures the situation well.  Oklahoma, \\nthe Nation, and local agencies and courts enjoy a highly successful partnership on child custody.  \\nUnder ICWA and its state counterpart, 25 U.S.C. §§ \\n1911(c), 1912(a); Okla. Stat. tit. 10, § 40.4, the Nation intervenes in every custody proceeding involving a Creek child, and those proceedings already \"utilize to \\nthe maximum extent possible\" Nation services in \\nsecuring appropriate placements, id. § 40.6. \\n  The Nation is committed to preserving current placements, and ready options exist for it to do so.  As \\nthe States\\' ICWA brief notes,  the State and Nation \\ncan compact to allocate jurisdiction over custody proceedings,\\n34 and any such compact could recognize \\ncontinuing state court authority over existing placements.  See 25 U.S.C. § 1919(a); Okla. Stat. tit. \\n10, § 40.7.  The Nation can also establish enforceable \\nplacement preferences, including provisions conferring presumptive validity on existing placements under Nation law.  25 U.S.C. § 1915(c).  \\nThe Nation and the State share the same goals on this \\nissue, and overheated litigation rhetoric will not prevent their realization.'}\n",
      "{'C. The State Ignores the Detrimental Effects that Disestablishment Would Have on Reservation Governance': '. \\n \\n As detailed above, the Nation engages in \\nsubstantial governmental activities for the benefit of Indians and non-Indians alike on the Reservation and \\n \\n34 http://bit.ly/MCN-States-Amicus-Brief-ICWA , at 25-26.   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n46 \\n \\n does so in close cooperation with neighboring \\ngovernments.  A disestablishment holding would interfere significantly with these activities, because it \\nwould undermine the sense of shared jurisdiction that \\nunderpins the cooperation.  Under existing intergovernmental agreements, for example, the Nation\\'s Lighthorse Police participate in and make \\nsignificant contributions to police operations that \\nresult in the arrests of non-Indians on fee land within the Reservation; the Nation\\'s Transportation Department collaborates in the prioritization, planning, and execution of infrastructure projects on \\ncounty roads and bridges whose repair is essential to \\nthe safety of thousands of Reservation residents; and the Nation\\'s FVPP staff arrive in the middle of the night to help address grav e situations of family \\nviolence or sexual abuse in volving non-Indians on fee \\nland.  Loss of access to these services would follow \\ndisestablishment.  It would not be possible for officials of the State or its political subdivisions to share authority with respect to th eir constituents in this \\nmanner absent an understanding of overlapping \\njurisdiction.   And this is not simply speculative.  While cooperative law enforcement agreements commenced \\nin 2000, fourteen were executed after the Tenth \\nCircuit\\'s decision in Murphy ,\\n35 their consummation \\nbolstered by the understanding of shared jurisdiction the decision confirmed.  Similarly, individuals and entities ranging from a Sheriff to state court judges to \\nthe Okmulgee Police Department have praised the \\nFVPP\\'s work because it embodies \"a holistic and \\n \\n35 See http://bit.ly/MCN-Lighthorse . \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n47 \\n \\n collaborative approach in rural communities across \\nthe eleven counties that comprise the jurisdictional boundaries of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation.\"\\n36  \\nRecently, the Lighthorse Police took over the patrol \\noperations in the City of Mannford for an entire day to enable all police officers there to attend the funeral of their slain chief.\\n37  That sort of thing simply does \\nnot happen absent an understanding of the Nation\\'s \\nauthority.  \\nIn DeCoteau, this Court stated that \"competing \\npleas [regarding practical consequences] are not for \\nus to adjudge,\" 420 U.S. at 449, a conclusion this \\nCourt reiterated in Parker.  Text governs the proper \\nresolution of this case, but if consequences are to be considered, they militate in favor of affirmation of the \\nNation\\'s Reservation, not its disestablishment.'}\n"

      " In Nebraska v. Parker , 136 S. Ct. 1072 (2016), \n",
      "this Court confirmed that fundamental principles of \n",
      "statutory construction apply in determining whether Congress has acted to alter reservation boundaries.  \n",
      " \n",
      "1 No counsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in part.  \n",
      "No one other than amicus curiae  made a monetary contribution \n",

      "reservation of its land and diminish its boundaries, and its intent to do so must be clear,\" id. at 1078 \n",
      "(quotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, the analysis \n",
      "hinges on statutory text.  \"As with any other question \n",
      "of statutory interpretation, we begin with the text, ... the most probative evidence of diminishment.\"  Id. at \n",
      "1079 (quotation marks omitted).  While the history \n",
      "surrounding a statute can have bearing, \"mixed historical evidence ... cannot overcome the lack of clear textual signal that Congress intended to \n",

      "\"subsequent demographic history ... overcome [a textual] conclusion that Congress did not intend to diminish [a] reservation[.]\"  Id. at 1081-82.  \n",

By mobilizing \\ncurrently and formerly incarcerated people and their \\nfamilies who have been adversely affected by unjust \\nsentences, FAMM illuminates the human face of sen-tencing as it advocates fo r state and federal sentenc-\\ning reform.  FAMM advances its charitable purposes \\nin part through education of the general public and \\nthrough selected amicus  filings in important cases.   \\nThe interpretation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1) and the \\napplication of the principl es that govern all manda-\\ntory minimum sentencing statutes are of paramount \\nimportance to FAMM.  The court of appeals and  \\nthe government have adopted an interpretation of § 924(e)(1) that treats prior offenses as having been \\n“committed on occasions different from one another” \\nif there is any separation in time – even just a few \\nmoments – between those offenses.  That interpreta-\\ntion has led in many cases,  including this one, to \\nmandatory 15-year prison terms for so-called career \\ncriminals where offenses making up the criminal  \\n                                                 \\n1 Pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.6, counsel for amicus  \\nrepresent that they authored this brief in its entirety and that \\nnone of the parties or their counsel, nor any other person  \\nor entity other than amicus or its counsel, made a monetary \\ncontribution intended to fund the preparation or submission  \\no f  t h i s  b r i e f .   P u r s u a n t  t o  R u l e  3 7 . 3 ( a ) ,  c o u n s e l  f o r  amicus   \\nalso represent that all parties ha ve consented to the filing of \\nthis brief. \\n 2 \\n“career” occurred in the space of a single day, a single \\nhour, or even just a few minutes. \\nThis case offers the Court the opportunity to  \\ncorrect that harmful misinterpretation of the law and \\nan excellent vehicle to reaffirm the important role  \\nof the rule of lenity in constraining a particularly  \\nextreme mandatory minimu m statute.  As FAMM’s \\nmembers are keenly aware, in terpretation of language \\nthat triggers a mandatory minimum sentence often \\nmatters more to individual defendants’ lives and lib-\\nerty than interpretation of the elements for offenses \\nsentenced through the exercise of judicial discretion.  \\nWhere, as here, the government advances an expan-\\nsive interpretation of a mandatory minimum that \\nwould impose arbitrary, harsh sentences in a way lacking foundation in any legislative judgment, \\nFAMM has a strong interest in advocating for rigor-\\nous judicial scrutiny. \\nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY \\nI. The rule of lenity has an important role to  \\nplay in the interpretation of mandatory minimum sentencing statutes and shou ld be given special force \\nin cases that involve them.  Mandatory minimum \\nsentencing statutes pose special threats to individual liberty and the separation of powers.  Experience \\nteaches that such statut e s  l e a d  t o  s e v e r e  a n d  \\ndisproportionate sentences, reallocate power from \\nlegislators and judges to prosecutors, and often \\nultimately fail to achieve their ostensible goal of \\nsentencing uniformity.  Experience also teaches that \\nsuch statutes are poorly drafted and difficult to \\napply.  Because the costs of overreading harsh \\nsentencing statutes are high , lenity counsels in favor \\nof narrower reading. \\n 3 \\nA. The most obvious cost of error in overreading a  \\nmandatory minimum sentencing statute is the lost liberty of individuals who receive a far longer prison term than the legislature actually intended.  Lenity \\nembodies the courts’ “instinctive distaste[] against \\nmen languishing in prison unless the lawmaker has \\nclearly said they should.”  Henry J. Friendly, “Mr. \\nJustice Frankfurter and the Reading of Statutes,” in \\nBenchmarks  196, 209 (1967).  A mandatory 15-year \\nsentence based on less-than-certain evidence of \\nlegislative intent is indeed distasteful.  Mandatory \\nminimum statutes like the one here also reflect moral condemnation for a special subgroup of criminals – as \\nshown by Congress’s decision to pass an “Armed \\nCareer Criminal Act” (“ACCA”) – that should follow \\nonly from a genuine legislative decision. \\nMandatory minimum sentencing statutes also \\nimpair courts’ efforts to achieve the important goals \\nof fairness and proportionate punishment.  Although Congress has the power (within constitutional \\nbounds) to sacrifice fairness and proportionality to a \\nperceived greater good, courts should not conclude \\nthat Congress has done so based on guesswork or \\nspeculation about the meaning of an unclear statute.  \\nOften, mandatory minimum sentencing statutes fail \\nto achieve the goal of sentencing uniformity because they place great power in the hands of prosecutors, \\nthus inviting inconsistent and arbitrary application.  \\nApplying the rule of lenity rigorously to such statutes \\nlessens those costs to the system and ensures that \\nthey are imposed only when Congress has truly \\nfound them justified. \\nBy contrast, erring on the side of narrow \\nconstructions for mandatory minimum statutes is \\nless risky.  Most importantly, judges always retain \\npower to sentence up to the statutory maximum or to \\n 4 \\nrun sentences for multiple offenses consecutively.  \\nThey do not need mandatory minimums to determine \\nappropriate sentences based on the nature of an \\noffense or the history and characteristics of an \\noffender.  Moreover, the go vernment is well situated \\nto press for new legislation if dissatisfied with the \\ncourts’ interpretation.  There is no reason to doubt \\nthat prosecutors will call for stronger criminal penalties in response to any true threat to public \\nsafety or that legislators will fail to answer such calls. \\nB. The risk of error is particularly acute when \\ncourts interpret mandatory minimum sentencing statutes.  As this Court knows all too well, Congress \\noften writes such statutes in a confusing way.  The \\nstatutory provision here resulted from a rare \\nconfession of error by the Solicitor General that, in \\nessence, Congress had left needed language out of a 15-year sentencing statute and so had inflicted a \\nharsher and broader penalty than anyone involved  \\nin the statute’s creation (the Justice Department \\nincluded) had anticipated.  This Court’s recent cases \\nhave invalidated other parts of § 924 as unconsti-\\ntutionally vague, and over the years the Court has \\nremarked on similar problems with other mandatory minimum sentencing statutes.  When Congress \\nenacts mandatory minimum sentencing statutes  \\nwith enormous effects on future defendants, but \\ngives little consideration to statutory details, the rule \\nof lenity provides a much-needed safeguard for \\nindividual liberty. \\nII. The rule of lenity confirms that this Court \\nshould reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.  \\nPetitioner Wooden correctly argues that 18 U.S.C. \\n§ 924(e) should be read in his favor even without the \\nrule of lenity.  If any doubt remains, lenity should \\ndispose of it.  That conclusion is further supported  \\n 5 \\nby examining judicial experience with cases under \\n§ 924(e)(1).  The standard endorsed by the court of \\nappeals – under which even a moment’s separation \\nbetween two prior offenses qualifies them as \\noccurring on different occasions – has led to \\ninconsistent results, arbitrary distinctions, and \\nrepeated judicial observations about confusion and \\nuncertainty in the statutory scheme. \\nA. One recurring type of situation involves \\nburglaries of related or adjacent structures or dwellings.  Examples include the mini-warehouses at \\nissue here; a group of adjacent storage units at the same street address in United States v. Carr , 592 \\nF.3d 636 (4th Cir. 2010); and three businesses in a \\nsingle strip mall in United States v. Hudspeth , 42 \\nF.3d 1015 (7th Cir. 1994) (en banc), abrogated on \\nother grounds by Shepard v. United States , 544 U.S. \\n13 (2005).  Whether assessed against the constitu-tional right to fair warnin g or the legislature’s sole \\nresponsibility under the Constitution to define \\ncrimes, the statute does no t clearly classify several \\nbreak-ins in the course of a day or an hour as prior \\noffenses on “occasions different from one another.”  \\nAccordingly, the statute should not be construed to \\nmandate 15 years in prison by treating such offenses \\nas separate violent felonies.  \\nB. Another situation that repeatedly arises under \\n§ 924(e) is an offense co mmitted while the defendant \\nevades or resists arrest for another offense.  \\nExamples include pushing a police officer after \\ncommitting a robbery, United States v. Schieman , \\n894 F.2d 909 (7th Cir. 1990); fleeing a police officer \\nafter a traffic stop that interrupted a domestic \\nassault, United States v. Davidson , 527 F.3d 703  \\n(8th Cir. 2008), vacated in part on other grounds ,  \\n551 F.3d 807 (8th Cir. 2008) (per curiam); and \\n 6 \\ncommitting two assaults in the course of a single \\nhigh-speed chase, Levering v. United States , 890 F.3d \\n738 (8th Cir. 2018).  The decisions applying § 924(e) to these situations acknowledge confusion and \\njudicial disagreement, with some courts ruling that any separation of time between the onset of two \\noffenses supports a finding that they occurred on different occasions.  No such rule can be clearly \\nderived from the present statute using ordinary rules \\nof statutory construction.  The courts of appeals should instead have followed the tradition of lenity to \\nanswer the difficult questions posed by this statute. \\nARGUMENT \\nI. THE RULE OF LENITY SHOULD BE \\nAPPLIED RIGOROUSLY TO MANDATORY \\nMINIMUM SENTENCING STATUTES \\n“[T]he rule of lenity[] teach[es] that ambiguities \\nabout the breadth of a cri minal statute should be \\nresolved in the defendant’s favor.”  United States v. \\nDavis , 139 S. Ct. 2319, 2333 ( 2019).  That rule has \\nfamously been described as “‘perhaps not much less old than’ the task of statut ory ‘construction itself.’”  \\nId. (quoting United States v. Wiltberger , 18 U.S.  \\n(5 Wheat.) 76, 95 (1820) (Marshall, C.J.)).   \\nAt its core the rule of le nity is an understanding \\nthat “a fair warning should be given to the world in \\nlanguage that the common world will understand,  \\nof what the law intends to  do if a certain line is \\npassed,” and that, “[t]o make  the warning fair, so far \\nas possible the line sh ould be clear.”  McBoyle v. \\nUnited States , 283 U.S. 25, 27 (1931) (Holmes, J.).  In \\naddition, judicial adherence to the rule of lenity also “places the weight of inertia upon the party” – that \\nis, the executive branch – “that can best induce \\nCongress to speak more clearly and keeps courts \\n 7 \\nfrom making criminal law in Congress’s stead.”  \\nUnited States v. Santos , 553 U.S. 507, 514 (2008) \\n(plurality); see Bell v. United States , 349 U.S. 81, 83 \\n(1955) (Frankfurter, J.) (“ When Congress leaves to \\nthe Judiciary the task of imputing to Congress an \\nundeclared will, the ambiguity should be resolved in \\nfavor of lenity.”). \\nIn several cases involving mandatory minimum \\nsentencing provisions, the Court has recognized and \\napplied the “presupposition . . . [that] doubts in the enforcement of a penal code” should be “resolve[d] . . . \\nagainst the imposition of a harsher punishment.”  Bell, 349 U.S. at 83.  Examples include Davis , which \\ninvoked lenity to reject a broader saving construction of a different provision of the same mandatory mini-\\nmum statute at issue here, see 139 S. Ct. at 2333; \\nBurrage v. United States , 571 U.S. 204 (2014), which \\ndescribed a 15-year mandat ory minimum statute as \\n“a criminal statute subject to the rule of lenity,” and \\nlenity as a reason the Court “[e]specially” could not \\ndepart from the “ordinary,  accepted meaning” of  \\n“the [statutory] text,” id. at 216; and United States  \\nv. Granderson , 511 U.S. 39 (1994), which “appl[ied] \\nthe rule of lenity” to “resolve [an] ambiguity” in a “mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment” \\nafter revocation of probation, id. at 56-57.  Those \\ndecisions cohere with others explaining that the rule of lenity assists “not only to resolve issues about the \\nsubstantive scope of criminal statutes, but to answer questions about the severity of sentencing.”  United \\nStates v. R.L.C. , 503 U.S. 291, 306 (1992) (plurality) \\n(citing Bifulco v. United States , 447 U.S. 381, 387 \\n(1980) (collecting cases)). \\nIndeed, especially good reasons warrant applying \\nthe rule of lenity rigorously to statutes that, like the \\nACCA, create aggravated offenses with mandatory \\n 8 \\nminimum sentences.  A broad construction bars \\njudges from tailoring the sentence to the offense and \\nthe offender, leading to particularly harsh conse-\\nquences that only Congress can correct.  A narrower \\nconstruction, by contrast, does not prevent judges \\nfrom imposing longer sentences where necessary.  \\n“These interpretive asymmetries give the rule of \\nlenity special force in the context of mandatory \\nminimum provisions.”  Dean v. United States , 556 \\nU.S. 568, 585 (2009) (Breyer, J., dissenting). \\nFurther, experience shows that mandatory mini-\\nmum statutes frequently present difficult problems \\nof statutory construction, creating a heightened risk \\nthat courts will read them to impose sentences that \\nCongress never intended.  Wh ere, as here, an unclear \\nstatute presents a palpable risk of error, courts \\nproperly refuse to “condemn a man to a minimum of \\n15 years in prison on the basis of . . . speculation,” \\nBegay v. United States , 553 U.S. 137, 154 (2008) \\n(Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment), about what \\nCongress meant to say. \\nA. The Rule of Lenity Helps Avoid the  \\nParticularly High Costs of Reading  \\nMandatory Minimums Too Broadly  \\n1. The costs of erroneously construing mandatory \\nminimum sentencing provisions too broadly are especially high, and the costs of construing them too \\nnarrowly are especially low.  The greatest cost of \\nreading a mandatory minimu m too broadly is that \\nindividual defendants lose  their liberty.  Mandatory \\nminimum provisions are, by design, severe.  They \\noften tie an additional prison sentence of years or \\ndecades (here, a decade and a half) to a single factual \\ndetermination.  Such provisions therefore speak to \\nthe core concern that has motivated courts to apply \\nthe rule of lenity for centuries:  the “instinctive \\n 9 \\ndistaste[] against men lang uishing in prison unless \\nthe lawmaker has clearly sa id they should.”  Henry \\nJ. Friendly, “Mr. Justice Frankfurter and the Reading of Statutes,” in Benchmarks  196, 209 (1967), \\nquoted in United States v. Bass , 404 U.S. 336, 348 \\n(1971).  Because of that concern, this Court “will not \\ninterpret a federal criminal statute so as to increase \\nthe penalty that it places on an individual when such \\nan interpretation can be based on no more than a guess as to what Congress intended.”  Ladner v. \\nUnited States , 358 U.S. 169, 178 (1958). \\nFurther, mandatory minimum provisions often are \\nsaid to reflect (at least in theory) the moral judgment \\nof the community that particular conduct deserves \\nharsher punishment.  In our system of government, \\nthat judgment is reserved to the legislature.  The \\nrule of lenity ensures that criminal sentences \\nactually reflect legislative judgment, rather than \\nguesswork by the courts abo ut what the legislature \\nmeant.  See Granderson , 511 U.S. at 69 (Kennedy, J., \\nconcurring in the judgment) (“‘[B]ecause criminal punishment usually represents the moral condemna-\\ntion of the community, legislatures and not courts \\nshould define criminal activity,’ and set the punish-\\nments therefor.”) (quoting Bass , 404 U.S. at 348) \\n(citation omitted); R.L.C. , 503 U.S. at 309 (Scalia, J., \\nconcurring in part and co ncurring in the judgment) \\n(describing one of “the rule of lenity’s . . . purpose[s]” \\nas “assuring that the society, through its represen-\\ntatives, has genuinely called for the punishment to \\nbe meted out”); Wiltberger , 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) at 95 \\n(explaining that “[t]he rule that penal laws are to  be construed strictly” is  founded not merely on \\n“tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals” \\nbut also on the “plain principle that the power of \\n 10 \\npunishment is vested in the legislative, not in the \\njudicial department”). \\nAny criminal statute presents these concerns,  \\nbut mandatory minimum provisions make them \\nparticularly weighty.  Unlike other criminal laws, \\nmandatory minimums are exceptions to the principle \\nthat courts should “impose a sentence sufficient,  \\nbut not greater than necessary,” to accomplish the goals of criminal punishme nt after considering  \\n“the nature and circumstances of the offense and  \\nthe history and characteristics of the defendant.”   \\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1).  A mandatory minimum is a \\ncongressional directive to subordinate justice in \\nindividual cases to a perceived need for greater \\ndeterrence or incapacitation generally.  Congress may choose to make that tradeoff (within constitu-\\ntional bounds), but the courts should ensure that \\nCongress has actually made that choice before \\nimposing needlessly harsh punishments.  Cf. Busic  \\nv. United States , 446 U.S. 398, 408-09 (1980) \\n(interpreting a sentencing enhancement; rejecting the “assumption that . . . Congress’ sole objective  \\nwas to increase the penalties . . . to the maximum \\nextent possible”). \\n2. The adverse consequences of erroneously \\nexpanding mandatory sentencing beyond the limits of congressional intent affect more than just \\nindividual defendants.  Such errors strike at the \\nfoundations of the sentencing system by under-\\nmining “sentencing proportionality – a key element of sentencing fairness.”  Harris v. United States , 536 \\nU.S. 545, 570-71 (2002) (Breye r, J., concurring in \\npart and concurring in the judgment), overruled by \\nAlleyne v. United States , 570 U.S. 99 (2013).  As the \\nSentencing Commission – quoted with approval by this Court – has explained:  “‘The “cliffs” that result \\n 11 \\nfrom mandatory minimums compromise proportion-\\nality, a fundamental prem ise for just punishment, \\nand a primary goal of the Sentencing Reform Act.’”  Neal v. United States , 516 U.S. 284, 291-92 (1996) \\n(quoting United States Sentencing Comm’n, Special \\nReport to the Congress:  Mandatory Minimum \\nPenalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System  iii \\n(Aug. 1991)). \\nFurther, the rule of leni ty historically has been \\njustified in part based on the “principle of legality”:  conduct can be criminalized , and penalties author-\\nized, only by legislative action, so “that the amount  \\nof discretion entrusted to those who enforce the law \\ndoes not exceed tolerable lim its.”  Herbert L. Packer, \\nThe Limits of the Criminal Sanction  93 (1968).  As \\nthe Court put it in Marinello v. United States , 138 S. \\nCt. 1101 (2018), “prosecutorial discretion” to enforce \\na statute with “wide-rangin g scope . . . places great \\npower in the hands of the prosecutor,” creating risks of “nonuniform execution” and “arbitary prosecution.”  \\nId. at 1108-09.  That concern is one reason for  \\nthe Court’s “‘traditional[] exercise[]’” of “‘restraint in \\nassessing the reach of a federal criminal statute.’”  Id. at 1109 (quoting United States v. Aguilar , 515 \\nU.S. 593, 600 (1995)).  And it is a special problem \\nwith mandatory minimums that effectively transfer \\nsentencing discretion from the trial judge, “the one \\nactor in the system most ex perienced with exercising \\ndiscretion,” to “an assistant prosecutor not trained in \\nthe exercise of discretion.”   An Address by Anthony \\nM. Kennedy, Associate Justic e, Supreme Court of the \\nUnited States, Speech at the American Bar Associ-\\nation Annual Meeting (Aug. 9, 2003), available at  \\nhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/speeches/sp_08-09-03.html. \\n 12 \\nInconsistently exercised discretion means that, in \\npractice, mandatory minimums fail to yield even \\nuniformity in sentencing – the benefit they are \\nsupposed to obtain at the cost of individual justice \\nand proportionality.  Over decades, the Sentencing \\nCommission has repeatedly reported “inconsisten[cy]” \\nand “wide geographic variations” in the use of mandatory minimum sentences.  E.g., United States \\nSentencing Comm’n, Application and Impact of  \\n21 U.S.C. § 851:  Enhanced  Penalties for Federal \\nDrug Trafficking Offenders  6 (July 2018) (finding \\n“significant variation in the extent to which . . . enhanced penalties were sought against eligible \\noffenders”); see also United States v. Angelos , 345  \\nF. Supp. 2d 1227, 1252 (D. Utah 2004) (discussing \\n“the potential for tremendous sentencing disparity if \\nfederal prosecutors across th e country do not uniformly \\ncharge . . . violations” of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)), aff’d , 433 \\nF.3d 738 (10th Cir. 2006).\\n2   \\n                                                 \\n2 See also  United States Sentencing Comm’n, Mandatory \\nMinimum Penalties for Sex Offenses in the Federal Criminal \\nJustice System  56 (Jan. 2019) (finding that, “[i]n fiscal year \\n2016, the mandatory minimum penalty for receipt [of child por-nography] [wa]s inconsistently applied,” leading to “substantial” \\ndifferences in sentences where “the conduct involved in the  \\noffenses was not meaningfully distinguishable”); United States Sentencing Comm’n, Report to Congress:  Mandatory Minimum \\nPenalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System  345 (Oct. \\n2011) (“2011 Report”) (finding “inconsistencies in application  \\nof certain mandatory minimum penalties, as shown by . . .  \\ndata analyses and confirmed by interviews of prosecutors and \\ndefense attorneys”); United States Sentencing Comm’n, Fifteen \\nYears of Guidelines Sentencing:  An Assessment of How Well  \\nthe Federal Criminal Justice System is Achieving the Goals  of Sentencing Reform  89 (Nov. 2004) (“Research over the past \\nfifteen years has consistently found that mandatory penalty \\nstatutes are used inconsistently in cases in which they appear \\nto apply.”). \\n 13 \\nIndeed, over the last two decades, different \\nAttorneys General have instructed federal prose-\\ncutors differently on how to use mandatory minimum \\nstatutes, switching between more- and less-aggressive \\napproaches.3  In adopting such policies, the executive \\nbranch takes into its own hands the tradeoff between \\nsentencing uniformity, on the one hand, and \\nindividual justice and proportionality, on the other.  Whatever the wisdom of the competing approaches, \\nthat practice emphasizes how mandatory minimum \\nstatutes transfer power over  individual liberty from \\nlawmakers and judges to pr osecutors.  In our adver-\\nsarial system, moreover, pr osecutors can and do use \\nthat power strategically in ways that undermine \\nstructural protections for individual liberties, such as by using the threat of a mandatory minimum to \\nobtain a guilty plea.  See United States v. Kupa ,  \\n976 F. Supp. 2d 417, 420 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) \\n(condemning the practice of “coerc[ing] guilty pleas, \\nand sometimes . . . coerc[ing] cooperation as well,  \\n[by] routinely threaten[ing] ultra-harsh, enhanced mandatory sentences that no one  – not even the \\nprosecutors themselves – thinks are appropriate”) \\n(footnote omitted),  aff ’d, 616 F. App’x 33  (2d Cir. 2015) . \\n                                                 \\n3 See Angelos , 345 F. Supp. 2d at 1253 & n.120 (discussing a \\n2003 memorandum intended “to reduce charging disparities \\nstemming from § 924(c)”); United States Sentencing Comm’n, \\nAn Overview of Mandatory Minim um Penalties in the Federal \\nCriminal Justice System 24-25 (July 2017) (comparing the 2013 \\n“Smart on Crime” initiative, which outlined circumstances  \\nin which prosecutors should “‘decline to charge’” mandatory \\nminimum sentences, to “revised guidance” in 2017 directing \\nprosecutors generally to “‘charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense,’” with seriousness measured by the \\ngreatest sentence, “ ‘including mandatory minimum sentences’ ”). \\n 14 \\nNor does the expansion of prosecutorial power \\nthrough mandatory minimum statutes stop at the \\ncharging stage.  Even after conviction, the prosecutor \\nholds an important key to lessening the effect of a \\nmandatory minimum sentence.  A district court is \\nfreed from restrictions on its sentencing discretion \\n“[u]pon motion of the Government . . . so as to reflect \\na defendant’s substantial assistance in the investi-gation or prosecution of another person,” 18 U.S.C. \\n§ 3553(e), or it can similarly reduce the sentence \\nlater, again with the government’s approval, under \\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b)(4).\\n4  Suc h \\ndiscretionary motions have large effects on \\nsentences, often reducing them by many years.5  \\nResearch has found “enorm ous differences in how \\nprosecutors exercise that di scretion, with substantial \\nvariation by district.”6  Again, within broad constitu-\\ntional bounds, Congress has the power to create such \\na system.  But the Court need not and should not \\nbroaden more than Congress’s language requires \\n                                                 \\n4 In certain cases involving no n-violent drug offenders, a  \\ndistrict judge may invoke 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f), often called a  \\njudicial “safety valve,” but the sa fety valve is “narrow” and still \\nrequires prosecutorial approval in substance if not in form.   \\nRachel E. Barkow, Categorical Mistakes:  The Flawed Frame-\\nwork of the Armed Career Criminal Act and Mandatory Mini-\\nmum Sentencing , 133 Harv. L.

By contrast, the costs of erroneously \\nconstruing a mandatory minimum provision too \\nnarrowly are relatively low, both for individual cases \\nand for the criminal justice system as a whole.  In \\ncases that fall outside the scope of a mandatory \\nminimum, but that nevertheless feature aggravating \\ncircumstances similar to those that moved Congress \\nto impose the minimum, a sentencing judge still has discretion (guided by § 3553(a) and the sentencing \\nguidelines) to impose a more severe sentence.  As Justice Breyer explained in Dean , “an interpretive \\nerror on the side of leniency[] still permits  the \\nsentencing judge to impose a sentence similar to, \\nperhaps close to, the statutor y sentence even if that \\nsentence . . . is not legislatively required .”  556 U.S. \\nat 584 (Breyer, J., dissenting). \\nMoreover, “an error that excludes (erroneously) a \\nset of instances Congress me ant to include . . . could \\nlead the Sentencing Commission to focus on those cases . . . [and] make avail able to Congress a body of \\nevidence and analysis that w ill help it reconsider the \\nstatute.”  Id. at 585.  Those who bring actions under \\nthe criminal laws (the executive branch) have far greater access to thos e who create them (the \\nlegislative branch) than do those who defend against \\nsuch actions (potential criminal defendants).  In light \\nof this practical reality, the rule of lenity “places the \\nweight of inertia upon the party that can best induce \\nCongress to speak more clearly.”  Santos , 553 U.S. at \\n514 (plurality).  \\n 16 \\nB. The Risk of Reading Mandatory Minimums \\nToo Broadly Is Also Particularly High  \\nThe risk of mistaking congressional intent is also \\nunusually high in the case of mandatory minimum \\nprovisions.  Those provisions often do not originate \\nfrom a careful and considered drafting process.   \\nThe history of the “occasions different from one \\nanother” language of § 924(e) (1) is a good example:  \\nas petitioner shows in detail, that language stemmed \\nfrom then-Solicitor-General  Fried’s confession of \\nerror to this Court in Petty v. United States , 481 U.S. \\n1034 (1987) (No. 86-6263).  In that case, the United States candidly admitted that the different-occasions \\nlanguage, present in “other enhanced penalty \\nprovisions,” was omitted from the predecessor to \\n§ 924(e)(1), even though the legislative history \\nshowed “that both Congress and those supporting the legislation, including the Department of Justice, did \\nnot intend that the penalty provision would apply \\nmore broadly than in the case of the other federal \\nenhanced penalty statutes.”   Pet. Br. App. 25a-26a; \\nsee id.  at 26a-31a. \\nHad the United States not taken the unusual step \\nof confessing error in Petty , the courts might well \\nhave concluded – as the Eighth Circuit already had –that Congress had intentionally left the different-occasions language out of th e statute.  After all,  \\nas the Solicitor General’s brief pointed out, courts \\nconstruing statutes often draw a “negative implica-\\ntion” from the omission of  language in one statute \\nthat is present in anot her, similar statute.  Id. at  \\n26a (citing Rodriguez v. United States , 480 U.S. 522, \\n525 (1987) (per curiam)).  An d courts reaching that \\nconclusion would have imposed minimum 15-year \\nsentences, not based on a “genuine[] call[] for th[at] \\n 17 \\npunishment” by “society[’s] . . . representatives,” R.L.C. , \\n503 U.S. at 309 (Scalia, J., concurrring in part and concurring in the judgment), but based on a slip of the legislative pen. \\nThere are other examples.  Indeed, § 924(e) \\npresents one:  its “residual clause” defined a “violent \\nfelony” to include any felony that “involves conduct \\nthat presents a serious potential risk of physical \\ninjury.”  18 U.S.C. § 924( e)(2)(B)(ii).  This Court \\nstruck that clause down as unconstitutionally vague \\nin Johnson v. United States , 576 U.S. 591 (2015), \\nrelying in part on “[n]ine years’ experience trying to derive meaning from the residual clause” as evidence \\nthat the courts had “embarked upon a failed enterprise.”  Id. at 601-02.  And the Court reached \\nthe same conclusion in Davis as to § 924(e)’s cousin \\n§ 924(c), striking down a similarly vague clause that \\ntriggered mandatory minimum sentences of 5, 7, 10, and 25 years.  See 139 S. Ct. at 2325, 2336. \\nIn United States v. O’Brien , 560 U.S. 218 (2010), \\nthe Court described as “ unclear” yet another provi-\\nsion of § 924(c) that i mposed a 30-year mandatory \\nminimum sentence for possessing a machinegun \\nwhile committing certain crimes.  Id. at 227, 229.  \\nFacing that lack of clarity, the Court applied a  five-factor test to determine whether machinegun \\npossession was intended to be an offense element  or as a sentencing factor.  See id. at 227-32.  In \\nGranderson , the Court diplomatically observed that \\n18 U.S.C. § 3565(a), imposi ng a mandatory minimum \\nsentence for certain revocations of parole, did not \\n“appear[] . . . to have received Congress’ careful \\nattention.”  511 U.S. at 42.  Justice Scalia less \\ndiplomatically called § 3565(a) “wretchedly drafted.”  \\nId. at 60 (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment). \\n 18 \\nThe Court’s repeated struggles with opaque text \\nand structure in mandatory minimum provisions  \\nare the kind of “experience”  that is “the life of the \\nlaw.”  Johnson , 576 U.S. at 601.  That experience \\nteaches that mandatory minimum sentencing statutes, including the one at issue here, commonly \\nuse “sweeping and imprecise language” that “set[s] \\nup a host of vexing constitutional and statutory \\ninterpretation questions for the courts.”  Barkow, \\nCategorical Mistakes , 133 Harv. L. Rev. at 202.   \\nThe rule of lenity, “as a so rt of ‘junior version of  \\nthe vagueness doctrine,’” United States v. Lanier , \\n520 U.S. 259, 266 (1997) (quoting Packer, Criminal \\nSanction  at 95), is a useful doctrinal approach to \\nanswering those questions.  If the Court finds the \\nstatute now before it ambiguous, lenity can help – \\nand an emphasis on lenity in the context of \\nmandatory minimum statutes can help guide the \\nlower courts to solve futu re, similar problems that \\nwill inevitably arrive.\\n7 \\n                                                 \\n7 Some have stated that “a court must find not just ambiguity \\nbut ‘grievous ambiguity’ before resorting to the rule of lenity.”  \\nShular v. United States , 140 S. Ct. 779, 788 & n.2 (2020)  \\n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (collecting examples).  Other recent decisions, drawing on a long line of authority, have applied \\nprinciples of lenity without the adjective “grievous.”  See, e.g., \\nDavis , 139 S. Ct. at 2333 (invoking lenity where “a criminal \\nstatute . . . d[id] not clearly proscribe” conduct and stating that \\n“ambiguities about the breadth of a criminal statute should  be resolved in the defendant’s favor”).  The notion that lenity \\napplies only in cases of “grievous ambiguity” appeared in this \\nCourt’s cases relatively recently.  See Chapman v. United \\nStates , 500 U.S. 453, 463 (1991) (quoting Huddleston v. United \\nStates , 415 U.S. 814, 831 (1974), which had stated that the \\nCourt “perceive[d] no grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in” a \\nstatute before it, id., but did not suggest that “grievous ambigu-\\nity” was a threshold requirement for any reliance on lenity).  \\nThe rule of lenity itself goes back for centuries.  In any event, \\n 19 \\nII. JUDICIAL EXPERIEN CE WITH 18 U.S.C. \\n§ 924(e)(1) SUPPORTS APPLYING THE \\nRULE OF LENITY \\nPetitioner’s brief ably sets forth why the Sixth \\nCircuit’s analysis finds no support in the ACCA’s \\ntext, history, or purpose.  FAMM agrees that this \\nCourt can and should reverse the judgment of the \\nSixth Circuit without resort to the rule of lenity or the principles that underlie it.  If the Court finds the \\nquestion close, however, it may help to consider \\njudicial experience applying the same standard that \\nthe Sixth Circuit applied here.  Examining that \\nexperience counsels in favor of lenity. \\nThat experience shows that the approach of the \\ncourt of appeals – asking wh ether “it [is] possible to \\ndiscern the point at which the first offense is \\ncompleted and the subsequent point at which the \\nsecond offense begins,” JA22 – does not satisfy this \\nCourt’s teaching that “so far as possible the line should be clear.”  McBoyle , 283 U.S. at 27.  Nor does \\nthat test align, in any way “the common world will \\nunderstand,” id., with Congress’s effo rt to classify as \\nan armed career criminal someone who has “three previous convictions . . . for a violent felony or a \\nserious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions \\ndifferent from one another, ” 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1).  \\nInstead, the temporal-sequencing test is at best “no \\nmore than a guess as to what Congress intended,” \\nLadner , 358 U.S. at 178 – a guess that produces \\narbitrary and unpredictable results. \\n                                                                                                   \\nwhere all the tools of statutory construction fail to resolve genu-\\nine ambiguity as to whether Congress has demanded a manda-\\ntory prison term, that ambiguity can fairly be called “grievous.” \\n 20 \\nA. Entries of Separate Structures on a Single \\nDay or Night Are Not Clearly Multiple  \\nDifferent “Occasions”  \\n1. The decision under review  is a useful starting \\npoint.  According to the Sixth Circuit, all 10 of Wooden’s 1997 convictions for burglary, which took \\nplace on a single night, were “separate ACCA \\npredicate offenses” that occurred on “‘occasions \\ndifferent from one another.’”  JA21 (quoting 18 \\nU.S.C. § 924(e)(1)).  To support that conclusion, the court of appeals reasoned that, “[w]hatever the \\ncontours of a ‘mini’ wareho use, Wooden could not be \\nin two (let alone ten) of them  at once”; that he “could \\nhave ceased his criminal conduct” after entering the \\nfirst warehouse without en tering nine more; and \\nthat, although “one could characterize th[e] cluster of \\nwarehouses as being adjoined ‘at the same business location,’” they were “different locations” because  \\ntheir owners had “distinct se ts of property rights.”  \\nJA23-24. \\nWooden argues persuasively (at 30) that the \\n“textual foundations” for the court of appeals’ “test \\n. . . are essentially nonexistent.”  Even if the statute \\ndoes not wholly foreclose th at test, it certainly gives \\nno fair warning that unlawfully entering 10 small \\nwarehouses within the same building on a single \\nevening triggers a harsh 15-year penalty for later \\nowning a gun, while spending the same amount  \\nof time in a single warehouse would not.  The court  \\nof appeals’ analysis thus  “mak[es] criminal law  \\nin Congress’s stead.”  Santos , 553 U.S. at 514 \\n(plurality).  At best it is judicial doctrine built up  \\nto cover the lack of clarity in the statute, rather  \\nthan anything that can claim to be an application of \\nthe statute itself.  Those who agree with Justice \\nScalia that “it is not consistent with the rule of lenity \\n 21 \\nto construe a textually ambiguous penal statute \\nagainst a criminal defendant on the basis of legis-\\nlative history,” R.L.C. , 503 U.S. at 307 (Scalia, J., \\nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment), \\ncan stop there, because the statute is at least \\ntextually ambiguous.   \\nThose who look to legislative history as an \\ninterpretive guide should reach the same ultimate \\nconclusion.  As Wooden persuasively shows (at 21-\\n25), that history ranges fr om an Assistant Attorney \\nGeneral’s 1984 testimony that the statute was meant \\nto catch “people who have demonstrated . . . that \\nlocking them up and letting them go doesn’t do any \\ngood,” Pet. Br. Add. 29a; to the Solicitor General’s 1987 concession in Petty that the statute was \\n“intended” to cover “multiple criminal episodes,” id. \\nat 26a; to then-Senator Biden’s 1988 statement that \\nthe statute was meant to “express[] [a] concept of \\nwhat is meant by a ‘career criminal,’” 134 Cong. Rec. S17,370 (daily ed. Nov. 10, 1988).  None of this \\nsuggests an intent – let alone a clear one – to \\nconsider multiple offenses on a single night to be a \\ncareer in crime because it took a few seconds to move \\nfrom one mini-warehouse to another within a cluster \\nof such warehouses. \\n2. The Fourth Circuit’s decision in United States \\nv. Carr , 592 F.3d 636 (4th Cir. 2010), illustrates the \\nsame point.  That case involved Daryl Carr, who possessed a firearm after previously pleading guilty \\nto 13 state-law charges of “felony breaking or entering.”  Id. at 638.  Those 13 offenses all took \\nplace on a single day in 2006 during which Carr broke into each of 13 “different storage unit[s]” at  \\nthe same street addres s (“N.C. 32 South”).  Id.  The \\ncourt of appeals conceded that the offenses were \\n“substantively the same and arguably had the same \\n 22 \\ncriminal objective,” but it nevertheless found them  \\nto be “separate and distinct criminal episodes.”  Id.  \\nat 645.  It reasoned that  the storage units were \\n“different locations”; that mo st, though not all, of the \\noffenses had “different victims”; and that Carr “had \\nthe opportunity . . . to cease and desist his criminal \\nbehavior” between one storage unit and the next, \\nadding in a footnote that “Carr simply could not have \\nbroken into or entered the 13 separate storage units simultaneously.”  Id. at 645 & n.8 (citation omitted).\\n8 \\nIn that analysis, the Fourth Circuit asserted that \\nthe statutory “‘definition may be clear’” but conceded \\nthat “‘the factual permutations surrounding the \\nACCA tend to create havoc’”; that “‘courts have \\napplied a multiplicity of factors’” in cases involving \\n§ 924(e); and that the “analysis” has a “fluid nature.”  Id. at 640 (quoting United States v. Letterlough ,  \\n63 F.3d 332, 335 (4th Cir.  1995)).  That sort of \\nassessment ought to be a warning sign in construing a criminal statute:  it calls to mind this Court’s \\nobservation in Johnson that “pervasive disagreement \\nabout the nature of the inquiry one is supposed to \\nconduct and the kinds of factors one is supposed to \\nconsider” is a sign of unacceptable vagueness.  576 \\nU.S. at 601.  The present case, to be sure, is not  \\na vagueness challenge.  But the rule of lenity – and  \\nthe “constitutional principles underlying th[at] rule,” \\nDavis , 139 S. Ct. at 2333 n. 8 – counsels against \\nadopting a line of authority whose own proponents \\nreport fluidity at best and havoc at worst. \\n                                                 \\n8 In another footnote, the Fourth Circuit noted that Carr had \\nother “state convictions” on different dates, at least one of which \\ninvolved “assault by pointing a gun,” Carr , 592 F.3d at 639 n.3, \\nbut did not analyze whether they  constituted ACCA predicates \\nor rely on them for its holding. \\n 23 \\n3. The Seventh Circuit’s decision in United States \\nv. Hudspeth , 42 F.3d 1015 (7th Cir. 1994) (en banc), \\ninvolved Thomas Hudspeth, who on one day in 1983 broke into three businesses – “a doughnut shop, a dry \\ncleaners, and an insurance company.”  Id. at 1018-19.  \\nThe businesses were in the same “strip mall,” id., \\nwhere the burglars made “a hole through [a] shared wall” and “forced open the door” connecting two of \\nthe businesses, id. at 1022.  The whole affair took \\n“approximately thirty-five minutes.”  Id. at 1018-19.  \\nA majority of the Seventh Circuit held that, because Hudspeth’s three offenses were “committed sequen-\\ntially, against different victims, at different times, \\nand at different locations,” they were “clearly crimes \\n‘committed on occasions different from one another.’”  Id. at 1021. \\nOne concurrence reasoned that Hudspeth was \\n“appropriately sentenced because . . . the record shows three separate crimes against separate victims \\nand not a single crime or criminal occasion (whatever that is).”  Id. at 1025 (Bauer, J., concurring).  One \\npartial dissent noted that past decisions had “grappl[ed] with the ambi guity of the ACCA” and \\nnoted “the malleability of the relevant terms,” including the different-occasions language.  Id. at \\n1025-26 (Flaum, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Another, joined by  five of the 11 judges who \\nheard the case, agreed that the “cold print of the \\nstatute books” did not answ er the question before  \\nthe court and argued for interpreting § 924(e) as  \\na “congressional mandate . . . to identify the true recidivist.”  Id. at 1034, 1037 (Ripple, J., concurring \\nin part and dissenting in part).  \\nNone of the opinions in Hudspeth suggested \\napplying the rule of lenity.  Yet at least six members \\n 24 \\nof the en banc court – counting Judge Bauer, whose \\nconcurrence expressed marked frustration with the \\nstatutory language – appear to have found no answer \\nto the question before them in § 924(e).9  As judicial \\nexperience goes, that is further evidence that \\n“Congress le[ft] to the Judiciary the task of imputing \\nto Congress an undeclared will,” Bell, 349 U.S. at 83, \\nconcerning prior offenses that occur over a short \\nperiod of time in several adjacent structures. \\nB. Evading or Resisting Arrest Does Not \\nClearly Involve Multiple Different “Occa-\\nsions”  \\nAnother  situation that repeatedly arises under \\n§ 924(e) is an offense af ter which the defendant \\nevades or resists arrest.  A rule that focuses on \\nsequence in time treats evasion or resistance as a \\ndifferent “occasion,” because it is possible to imagine a point at which the defendant stops the first offense \\nand starts running.  But an ordinary person trying  \\nto figure out the meaning of the statute from its \\nwords would not likely reach that conclusion.  Nor  \\ndo the tools of statutory construction suggest that \\nCongress meant to treat such an offender as a career \\ncriminal deserving 15 years in prison. \\n1. In United States v. Schieman , 894 F.2d 909 \\n(7th Cir. 1990), David Schi eman received a 15-year \\nsentence based in part on prior convictions of \\nburglary and aggravated batte ry of a police officer.  \\nId. at 910.  As a partial dissent explained:  \\n                                                 \\n9 Hudspeth relied on police reports to determine the circum-\\nstances of prior offenses; Shepard v. United States , 544 U.S. 13, \\n16 (2005), later barred courts from considering police reports  \\nin applying § 924(e).  The Seventh Circuit has since cited  \\nHudspeth as “abrogated” at least in part by Shepard .  See, e.g., \\nUnited States v. Elliott , 703 F.3d 378, 384 n.3 (7th Cir. 2012). \\n 25 \\nSchieman committed a robbery, walked three \\nblocks away to make a telephone call [at a phone \\nbooth] to arrange transportation away from the \\nscene, and, in an attempt to evade apprehension, \\npushed a police officer at the phone booth.  The \\npushing incident occurred approximately five \\nminutes after the robbery. \\nId. at 913 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and \\ndissenting in part).  The majority reasoned that, “[o]nce the original crime is complete, there is no \\nprincipled way to distinguish” between a battery \\n“within ten minutes of the burglary” and one “a day after the burglary.”  Id. at  913 (majority). \\nOne giving the words “different” and “occasion” \\ntheir ordinary meaning might well think that both \\nSchieman’s burglary and his attempt to escape five \\nminutes later occurred on the same occasion.  One \\nthinking of the statute as an attempt to identify \\ncareer criminals would reach the same result.  And \\nthe Schieman court’s reasoning only emphasizes  \\nhow traditional principles of lenity support that conclusion.  The court took a case it thought clear \\n(escape a day later) and used it to resolve a case  \\nit thought unclear (escape five minutes later) by \\narguing the lack of a “principled . . . distin[ction]” \\nbetween the two.  But the felt need to invoke the day-after hypothetical itself shows that the statute does \\nnot speak clearly to the five -minute case.  The court’s \\nrole was therefore to limit the 15-year sanction to the \\ncase where it was unambiguously intended. \\n2. In United States v. Davidson , 527 F.3d 703 \\n(8th Cir. 2008), vacated in part on other grounds , 551 \\nF.3d 807 (8th Cir. 2008) (per curiam), Mark Davidson \\nwas sentenced under § 924(e)  based on prior convic-\\ntions that included an attempted domestic assault \\n 26 \\nand fleeing from a police officer who interrupted that \\nattempt with a traffic stop.  Id. at 707.  The Seventh \\nCircuit conceded that the “pause between the two offenses was brief” and that the crimes were \\ncommitted in “rapid succession,” but reasoned that  \\na “moment of relative calm” had occurred when  \\nthe officer stopped Davidson, creating “a point of \\ndemarcation between episodes” that justified treating \\nDavidson’s prior convictions as separate.  Id. at 710. \\nThe Davidson court candidly acknowledged that \\nthe circuits had “struggled with th[e] problem” of applying § 924(e) to resist ance or evasion offenses, \\n“reaching arguably inconsistent results,” id. at 709, \\ndiscussing Schieman and other examples.  Considered \\nas an exercise in the common-law method, the “point of demarcation” analysis that Davidson derived \\nmight not be exceptional.  But it has been settled \\nsince United States v. Hudson , 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 32 \\n(1812), that “federal crimes . . . are solely creatures of \\nstatute,” Liparota v. United States , 471 U.S. 419, 424 \\n(1985), a principle that lenity helps protect, see id. at \\n427-28.  And the distinction that Davidson and cases \\nlike it draw – if it can even be squared with the \\nstatute at all – is clearly a rule made by the courts \\nrather than one set down by statute. \\n3. In Levering v. United States , 890 F.3d 738 (8th \\nCir. 2018), Merwyn Leveri ng was sentenced under \\n§ 924(e) based on prior convictions that included at \\nleast two assaults in the cour se of a high-speed flight \\nfrom police officers in a stolen automobile.  Id. at \\n739.  Levering argued that the assaults were not committed on different occasions because the flight \\nwas a “‘continuous course of conduct.’”  Id. at 741.  \\nThe Eighth Circuit acknowledged that “the phrase \\n‘continuous course of conduct’ appears in our cases on \\n 27 \\nthis subject,” but rejected  it as “unhelpful to the \\nanalysis.”  Id. at 742.  Instead, the court relied on the \\nfact that the assaults were committed “at different times in different counties against different victims.”  \\nId.  The Eighth Circuit acknowledged that several \\nunpublished decisions from the Sixth Circuit pointed \\nto a different result, but “respectfully differ[ed]” with them.  Id.   \\nLike the Fourth Circuit’s acknowledgment of “havoc” \\nin Carr , the vigorous disagreement among members \\nof the Seventh Circuit in Hudspeth , and the Eighth \\nCircuit’s own earlier acknowledgment of “arguabl[e] \\ninconsisten[cy]” in Davidson , the reasoning of \\nLevering points to the type of pervasive uncertainty \\nabout statutory application that suggests courts have gone beyond the guidance that an unclear statute \\ncan offer.  It is especially  telling that – as the Eighth \\nCircuit’s criticism of the Sixth Circuit shows – courts theoretically applying the sa me sequential test reach \\ndifferent results as to similarly situated defendants. \\n4. None of this is to deny that fleeing from arrest \\nand assaulting someone while doing so is not serious misconduct that state and sometimes federal law \\nproperly criminalize.  The police officer in Schieman \\ncould have been hurt, as could the bystanders to the \\nhigh-speed chases in Davidson and Levering .  Nor is \\nthere any doubt that after their prior convictions the \\nvarious defendants were prohibited from possessing guns, see 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), and could be punished \\nfor breaking that law.  The function of § 924(e), \\nhowever – as its text, structure, and history all show – is to carve out a special set of repeat offenders, \\nlabeled as “armed career criminals,” for special \\ncondemnation and harsh mandatory punishment.  It \\nis impossible to read the cases struggling with these \\n 28 \\nissues and conclude that the legislature has “clearly \\nsaid” that those defendants should “languish[] in \\nprison,” Bass , 404 U.S. at 348 (cit ation omitted), for \\nat least 15 years. \\nCONCLUSION \\nThe court of appeals’ judgment should be reversed. \\n \\n \\nMARY PRICE \\nGENERAL COUNSEL  \\nFAMM 1100 H Street, N.W. \\nSuite 1000 \\nWashington, D.C. 20005 (202) 822-6700 \\n \\n \\n \\nMay 10, 2021\\n \\n Respectfully submitted, \\n \\nGREGORY G.

F\\nAM. PSYCH . 529 (2008) ............................ 7 \\n1 \\n INTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE1 \\n Amicus Curiae  are a non-Indian couple, Aubrey \\nNelson and Sam Evans-Brown, who adopted an Indian \\nchild, M.E. Aubrey and Sam decided to adopt because they wanted to grow their family, share their love with \\na child who needed a home, and  give their first child a \\nsibling while Aubrey was recovering from complica-tions attributable to birth injuries. Their adoption at-\\ntorney referred them to an agency in Arizona, which \\nconnected them with a bi rthmother named \\\"Tina.\\\"\\n2 \\nAubrey and Sam were overjoyed that Tina chose them \\nbut were confused about pressure from the adoption \\nattorneys involved to keep the adoption closed to any \\ncontact with M.E.'s Tribes. Aubrey and Sam strongly \\nbelieve in the importance of open adoptions because \\nopenness confers many long-term benefits on all par-ties\\u2014adoptive parents, birth parents, and children, \\nIndian and non-Indian alike. \\n Aubrey and Sam support the Indian Child Wel-\\nfare Act (the ICWA), including the placement prefer-\\nences, because it promotes open adoptions for Indian \\n \\n 1 All parties have consented to the filing of this brief. No \\ncounsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part, and no counsel or party made a monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation or submission of this brief. No person other than Amicus Curiae , its members, or its coun sel made a monetary con-\\ntribution to its preparation or submission. \\n \\n2 To protect the birth mother's privacy, Amicus Curiae  refer \\nto her by a pseudonym. In addition, although some birth mothers prefer other language, such as \\\"first mother,\\\" Amicus Curiae  use \\n\\\"birth mother\\\" or \\\"birth pare nt\\\" because those terms are com-\\nmonly used in adoption literature. \\n2 \\n children, and they believe keeping M.E. connected to \\nher time-honored tribal customs and traditions is in \\nher best interests. Had a member of M.E.'s family been \\navailable to adopt her, Aubrey and Sam would have supported such a placement because they believe it is \\nimportant to keep families together when possible and \\nbelieve that familial placement would have kept M.E. directly connected with her tribal community. It is be-\\ncause Aubrey and Sam love their daughter so fiercely \\nand believe that M.E. has a right to know her Tribes, her culture, and her extended family, that they submit \\nthis brief in support of the ICWA. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nINTRODUCTION AND \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\n The benefits of adoption are well established. \\nAdoption allows birth parents to give their children a \\nfamily when they are unable to provide one; adoptive \\nparents can start or grow a family and raise happy, \\nhealthy children; and adoption gives children the gift \\nof a loving, supportive home. The ICWA's procedural and substantive requirements increase the benefits of \\nadoptions by creating a platform for openness in adop-\\ntions and a conduit to Tribal identity. \\n Openness in adoptions reflects the understanding \\nthat communication between birth parents, adoptive parents, and children confers distinct and important \\nadvantages to all parties. Op enness in adoption bene-\\nfits all parties by giving access to vital information \\n3 \\n such as medical and genetic hi story. It also allows chil-\\ndren to maintain important connections to culture and \\nextended family. Open adoptions are particularly im-\\nportant for Indian children because openness allows Indian children to maintain political ties to their In-\\ndian Tribes and receive the ad vantages that come with \\ntribal membership. Without the ICWA's substantive and procedural bulwarks it is too easy for Indian chil-\\ndren to lose essential connection to their Tribal iden-\\ntity. \\n In addition to cultivating a landscape of openness, \\nthe ICWA allows, and sometimes gives greater prefer-ence to, non-Indians seeking to adopt or foster Indian \\nchildren, as demonstrated by Aubrey and Sam's and \\nthe Individual Plaintiffs' stories of successful adoption. And these stories are not unique. Indian children are \\nadopted or fostered by non-Indian families every year. \\nEven if the ICWA prohibited adoption or fostering by non-Indians, which it does  not, there simply are not \\nenough Indian homes for Indian children. Non-Indian \\nfamilies are therefore needed to give Indian children loving homes. \\n Moreover, the first preference under the ICWA for \\nadoption or foster care is placement with extended \\nfamily, a category that includes both Indians and non-\\nIndians because the ICWA does not differentiate be-tween the two when it discusses family. The ICWA's \\npreference for placement with extended family is con-\\nsistent with numerous state laws that give preference to extended family placements. Additionally, when \\nmultiple placement options are available, the \\\"good \\n4 \\n cause\\\" exception to the ICWA's placement preferences \\nallows courts to balance the best interests of the Indian \\nchild against other factors that may warrant place-\\nment outside of the preferences. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nARGUMENT \\nI. OPENNESS IN AD OPTION AND CONNEC-\\nTION TO FAMILIES AND TRIBES IS IN \\nTHE BEST INTEREST  OF CHILDREN. \\n The ICWA serves as a crucial tool for openness in \\nadoptions because it informs Indian children of their identity and heritage. Without the ICWA's conduit \\nconnecting Indian children to their Tribes, many adop-\\ntions, such as the one Aubrey and Sam experienced, are shrouded in secrecy, a pro cess which only serves to \\nhurt children, birth parents, and adoptive parents. The \\nICWA gives Tribes the tools necessary to participate in placement proceedings to ensure that Indian children \\nremain connected and aware of their customs and tra-\\nditions. See, e.g., 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1912(a) (providing notice \\nrequirements so that Tribes are informed when Indian \\nchildren are in involuntary placement proceedings).\\n3 \\n \\n 3 The requirement of notice under 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1912(a) does \\nnot apply to voluntary adoption proceedings such as Aubrey \\nand Sam's. However, providing notice to Tribes in voluntary pro-ceedings fosters openness and se veral states have enacted no-\\ntice requirements that also apply to voluntary proceedings. \\nSee, e.g., Iowa Code Ann. \\u00a7 232B.5(8) (2022) (providing notice to \\nTribes in voluntary proceedings); Minn. Stat. Ann. \\u00a7 260.761(3) (2021) (providing notice to Tribes in voluntary adoptive and pre-adoptive proceedings); 10 Okla. Stat. Ann. \\u00a7 10-40.4 (2022) (providing \\n \\n5 \\n The ICWA therefore fosters a culture of openness in \\nadoption that leads to many positive outcomes from \\nopen adoptions and a connection to one's familial and \\ncultural identity. \\n \\nA. Openness in Adoption. \\n For much of the 20th century, adoptions were se-\\ncretive affairs where parents did not tell their children that they were adopted or who their birth parents \\nwere. See Deborah H. Siegel & Susan Livingston \\nSmith, Openness in Adoption from Secrecy and Stigma \\nto Knowledge and Connections , Evan B. Donaldson \\nAdoption Institute at 5 (M ar. 2012). Closed adoptions\\u2014\\nwhere there is little to no contact between children and \\ntheir birth parents\\u2014reflect societal attitudes from the \\nearly and mid-20th century, when parents and state \\nlegislatures sought to protect adopted children from the stigma of illegitimacy, misplaced fear that birth \\nparents would eventually \\\"take back\\\" the child, and \\nthe mistaken belief that adopted children could simply\\u2014and without question\\u2014assume their adoptive \\nparents' family history and culture. Secrecy and confi-\\ndentiality, despite the adoptive parents' best intentions and efforts, often led to adopted adolescents having un-\\nresolved identity questions concerning their family \\nhistory and the reason for their adoption. \\n \\nnotice to Tribes in voluntary proceedings); N.M. Stat. Ann. \\n\\u00a7 32A-28-2 (defining child custody proceeding to include adoptive placement) and \\u00a7 32A-28-5 (requiri ng notice for all child custody \\nproceedings). \\n6 \\n  Societal attitudes shifted slowly towards some \\nform of open adoptions\\u2014in which children are aware \\nwho their birth parents are and have varying degrees \\nof contact with them\\u2014or some form of mediated adop-tion\\u2014in which the adoption agency facilitates some \\nform of regular contact between birth parents and \\ntheir children.\\n4 In 1997, for instance, only 16% of re-\\nspondents to a national survey by the Evan B. Don-\\naldson Adoption Institute approved of birth mothers \\nsending cards or letters to adoptive families, with the majority of respondents saying it was only acceptable \\nin some or very few cases.\\n5 The last few decades, how-\\never, have seen a paradigmat ic shift\\u2014so much so that, \\nas of 2012, closed adoptions represented only about 5% \\nof placements, whereas 55% of placements were fully \\ndisclosed, and 40% were mediated.6 \\n The shift toward openness is an important devel-\\nopment that reflects the now-widespread understand-ing that secrecy in adoptions has a negative impact on \\nadopted children, birth parents, and adoptive parents. \\nOpen adoptions come with many benefits including measurably increased satisfaction and peace of mind \\n \\n 4 Amicus Curiae  recognize that open adoptions may not be \\npossible in some cases, such as international adoption, or may not \\nbe advisable in some cases, such as if severe abuse was involved. \\n 5 See Deborah H.

This type of \\ninformation facilitates identity formation, as well as \\npositive feelings toward their birth parents and others. Further, open adoptions help children cope with the \\nuncertainty and the ambiguous sense of loss that come \\nfrom \\\"losing\\\" birth parents, because openness gives children a link to their b iological families and commu-\\nnity.\\n11 In addition, children in open adoptions reported \\nhigher self-esteem, their parents rated them lower in behavioral problems, and th eir families reported more \\ntrust for their parents, fewe r feelings of alienation and \\nbetter overall family functioning.\\n12 \\n \\nB. Sam and Aubrey's Adoption Story. \\n In early 2020, Aubrey Nelson and Sam Evans-\\nBrown wanted to grow their family and give their first child a sibling. However, a year and a half after their \\nson was born, Aubrey was still recovering from compli-\\ncations stemming from birth injuries. As a result, the \\n \\n(2007); Gretchen M. Wrobel et al., Openness In Adoption and the \\nLevel of Child Participation , 67 C HILD  DEV. 2358 (1996). \\n 11 See Kimberly A. Powell & Tamara D. Afifi, Uncertainty \\nManagement and Adoptees' Ambiguous Loss of their Birth Par-ents, 22 J. S\\nOC. & P ERS. RELATIONSHIPS  129 (2005). \\n 12 See Julie K. Kohler et al., Adopted Adolescents' Preoccupa-\\ntion with Adoption: The Impact on Adoptive Family Relationships , \\n64 J. M ARRIAGE  & F AMILY  93 (2002). \\n9 \\n couple decided to share their love with a child who \\nneeded a home, and they began exploring adoption. \\nThe couple reside in New Hampshire, and through \\nword of mouth they sett led on a well-known New \\nHampshire adoption attorney, completed the necessary \\npaperwork and home study, and paid the attorney's \\nfees. Their New Hampshire attorney worked with a lawyer in Arizona and an agency, Arizona Adoption \\nHelp, to locate potential birth mothers. \\n After completing their paperwork, Aubrey and \\nSam began receiving emails from Arizona Adoption \\nHelp about potential birth mothers and potential adop-\\ntive children. If they were \\\"interested\\\" in the child, the \\nadoption agency instructed them to indicate their in-\\nterest, at which point the agency would \\\"share\\\" their \\nprofile with the birth mother. For each of these profiles, \\nthe adoption agency estimate d the cost of the adoption, \\nwhich typically was $30,000 for the Arizona attorney (which included birth parent  living expenses), $2,500 \\nfor a counselor hired by the adoption agency (who, in \\nAubrey and Sam's case, also served as the notary on the adoption paperwork), and $14,000 for the New \\nHampshire attorney. The cost to adopt would therefore \\nrange from $40,000 to $50,000, and adoption was not guaranteed. The costs for ea ch adoption were mostly \\nthe same, but with added complication and cost for \\nadopting an Indian child. Sam and Aubrey were later informed that this was due to the need to comply with \\nthe ICWA, but aside from hiring another attorney at \\nan extra cost and a longer stay in Arizona in order  to \\\"deal with ICWA,\\\" no other details were readily \\n10 \\n provided about what was required to comply. This was \\nsomewhat perplexing to Sam and Aubrey because the \\nadoption agency also strongly discouraged any commu-\\nnication with an Indian child's Tribe. \\n A birth mother named Tina living in Phoenix, Ar-\\nizona, ultimately selected Aubrey and Sam as adoptive parents. Tina reported that her great grandmother \\nwas Cherokee. The alleged father of the baby girl was \\na Navajo tribal member but was not involved in the adoption or in a relationship with Tina, and he never \\nestablished paternity. Neither the Cherokee nor the \\nNavajo Nations were involved in the adoption, and Tina's adoption attorney from Arizona Adoption Help \\nadvised Aubrey and Sam that, due to the Indian ances-\\ntry involved, \\\"the safest course would be for your cli-ents to retain [another attorney] to represent birth \\nparents in taking ICWA consents.\\\" The lawyers in the \\ncase also strongly discouraged any contact with Tina during the process. Aubrey and Sam were thrilled that \\nTina chose them but were co nfused about the secrecy \\nsurrounding M.E.'s tribal status. \\n Tina gave birth to a baby girl on September 11, \\n2020, in Phoenix, Arizona. Almost immediately, the baby girl was placed with Sam and Aubrey, and they \\nnamed her M.E. Twelve days later, the mother's attor-\\nney filed a consent to voluntary termination of paren-tal rights on behalf of Tina in the Coconino County \\nSuperior Court in Flagstaff, Arizona, a court over 150 \\nmiles from Tina's residence. In Arizona, an adoption petition should be filed in the court of the county where \\n11 \\n the prospective adoptive parent resides,13 and no party \\nto the case resided in Coconino County. Aubrey and \\nSam were later informed by mother's attorney that Co-\\nconino County was a better forum for ICWA cases. Au-brey and Sam believe the forum was chosen to prevent \\nany tribal involvement. \\n Fourteen days after M.E. was born, the Judge in \\nCoconino County issued an Order terminating the pa-\\nrental rights of Tina. The Judge held that although the ICWA applied to M.E., there was \\\"good cause\\\" to devi-\\nate from the placement preferences based on the Tina's \\nrequest to deviate from the preferences,\\n14 and placed \\nthe child with Aubrey and Sam. Again, although they \\nwere happy that the Court pl aced M.E. with them, they \\nhad concerns that Tina was not fully informed about ICWA or her options. This concern arose because the \\nattorneys involved only pe rmitted limited contact with \\nTina, especially before M.E.'s birth. The attorneys told Aubrey and Sam they should not ask Tina about M.E.'s \\nheritage and the attorneys themselves ignored Sam \\nand Aubrey's request that they obtain and share de-tails about M.E.'s Cherokee heritage. Aubrey and Sam \\nwere also prevented from discussing other adoption de-\\ntails with Tina, including her preferences about con-tacting M.E.'s Tribes. Although Aubrey and Sam now \\n \\n 13 See Ariz. Rev. Stat. \\u00a7 8-104 (providing that venue for adop-\\ntion proceedings is appropriate \\\"in the county where the prospec-tive adoptive parent resides or, if applicable, in the county where the child is a ward\\\"). \\n \\n14 Good cause may be based on the preference of the parent. \\nSee 25 C.F.R. \\u00a7 23.132(c)(1). \\n12 \\n exchange messages with Tina regarding M.E., Aubrey \\nand Sam still do not underst and why the adoption was \\nshrouded in secrecy when Aubrey, Sam and Tina's \\ngoals were M.E.'s best interests, which necessarily in-cludes open communication about M.E.'s tribal mem-\\nbership and heritage. \\n The attorneys involved in M.E.'s adoption also \\nasked Aubrey and Sam to submit written verification \\nthat they would not enroll M.E. or have any contact \\nwith the Navajo or Cherokee Nations for at least five \\nyears. Although they felt pressured to sign the docu-\\nment, they declined. Aubrey and Sam want their daughter, M.E., to know where she comes from, and \\nthey believe that it is in her best interest to have a con-\\nnection to her Tribes, because of the importance of fam-ily history, access to ho nored Tribal customs and \\ntraditions, and political membership. See, e.g., Samuel-\\nson v. Little River Band of Ottawa Indians-Enrollment Comm'n , 06-113-AP, 2007 WL 6900788, at 2 (Little \\nRiver Ct. App. 2007) (\\\"Tribal membership for Indian \\npeople . . . is the essence of one's identity, belonging to \\ncommunity, connection to one's heritage and an affir-\\nmation of their human being place in this life and \\nworld.\\\"). Had things been different\\u2014for instance if M.E.'s family, such as an aunt, uncle or grandparent, \\nor other extended family, were available to adopt \\nM.E.\\u2014Aubrey and Sam would have supported appli-cation of the placement preferences and not sought to \\ndeviate under a good cause exception. They support \\nkeeping children with their families when possible, es-pecially if that means that a child retains a close \\n13 \\n connection with their family, Tribe, and community. In \\naddition, during the adoption Aubrey and Sam were \\naware that the ICWA did not require them to keep \\nM.E.'s adoption a secret or refrain from contacting the Navajo or the Cherokee Nations. To the contrary, Au-\\nbrey and Sam believe the ICWA encourages connection \\nbetween Indian children and their Tribes and deter-mines that these relationship s are in their best inter-\\nests. \\n Aubrey and Sam believe that the private adoption \\nindustry, or at least some of  its participants, purposely \\nobfuscate the ICWA's requirements and unnecessarily push adoptive parents towards closed adoptions, re-\\ngardless of an adoptive parents' wishes, in order to \\nkeep Indian children like M.E. separated from their Tribes. In the end, these se cretive practices only serve \\nto hurt children and prospecti ve adoptive families and \\nimpede the ICWA's procedural requirements that fa-cilitate openness in adoption. Aubrey and Sam's prior-\\nity is M.E.'s well-being, and they understand that the \\nICWA serves M.E.'s best interests by establishing a connection with her tribal community and by ensuring \\nthat M.E. is placed in a loving and caring home. \\n For instance, Aubrey and Sam only learned about \\naw\\u00e9\\u00e9' ch'ideeldloh  (first laugh ceremony)\\u2013\\u2013a tradi-\\ntional Navajo celebration that marks a baby's progres-sion toward a healthy life and  is customarily organized \\nby the person who made a ne w baby laugh for the first \\ntime\\u2013\\u2013nearly a year after it would have been appropri-ate to hold this gathering. This is just one early missed \\nopportunity to connect M.E. and the rest of her family \\n14 \\n to her heritage, and an example of why many children \\nin closed adoptions struggle to form strong identities. \\nDespite missing this important Navajo tradition, Au-\\nbrey and Sam have taken steps to open the adoption. For instance, they remain in touch with Tina, and pro-\\nvide her with updates about M.E. Tina has expressed \\nher hopes for M.E. and h elped connect Aubrey and \\nSam to the putative father. Sam and Aubrey also wrote \\nto one of M.E.'s Tribes and  asked for information on \\nhow they might establish a relationship with an indi-vidual willing to serve as a cultural mentor for their \\nfamily. The information Sam and Aubrey have learned \\nhas been helpful in planning to support M.E.'s expo-sure to her culture and traditions as she grows older \\nand might begin to question her identity. \\n \\nC. Openness in Adopti on Benefits Indian \\nChildren. \\n The story of Sam, Aubrey and M.E. illustrates the \\nimportance of openness in adoption, particularly for \\nIndian children. It is crucial for adopted children to \\nhave access to their birth re latives, and thus to their \\nbirth family and cultural histories. Equipped with \\nthis knowledge, children can begin to understand  \\nthe reasons leading to their  adoption and to answer \\nfundamental questions such as \\\"Who am I?\\\"; \\\"Where \\ndo I come from?\\\"; \\\"Why do I look the way I do?\\\"; \\n\\\"What is family?\\\"; and \\\"Do I have other brothers or \\nsisters?\\\" Open adoption also gives these children ac-\\ncess to important medical, genealogical, and cultural \\ninformation. Without this knowledge, many adoptive \\n15 \\n children struggle with ongoing uncertainty and have \\nno way to answer these fundamental identity ques-\\ntions. \\n These potential harms are particularly significant \\nfor Indian children. There is an extensive history of \\nactive erasure of Indian identity through boarding schools and other policies aimed at disrupting Indian \\nfamilies.\\n15 See 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1902 (a cknowledging the \\nimportance of the \\\"unique values of Indian culture\\\"). The ICWA's stated goal is therefore \\\"to protect the best \\ninterests of Indian children,\\\" in part by keeping Indian \\nchildren connected to their Tribes. Id. \\n Moreover, historical policies of separating children \\nfrom parents have resulted in increased detrimental impacts on Indian children and families. See Missis-\\nsippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield , 490 U.S. \\n30, 49\\u201350 (1989) (\\\"Congress' concern over the place-\\nment of Indian children in non-Indian homes was \\nbased in part on evidence of the detrimental impact on \\nthe children themselves of such placements outside their culture.\\\"). Child development scholars have long \\nrecognized that adolescent crime, drug abuse, alcohol-\\nism, and suicide are more pervasive for an Indian child \\n \\n 15 See generally  Brief of Amici Curiae  Historian Organiza-\\ntions in Support of Respondent \\u00a7 II, Haaland et al. v.

Topper, Drinking Patterns, Culture Change, \\nSociability, and Navajo Adolescents , 1 A\\nDDICTIVE  DIS-\\nEASES : AN INT'L J. 97 (1974)). Allowing openness in \\nadoption mitigates these impacts by keeping Indian \\nchildren connected to their communities. \\n The ICWA also serves to keep Indian children cul-\\nturally and politically connected to their Tribes and offers many advantages that come with tribal citizen-\\nship. E.g., Samuelson , 2007 WL 6900788, at 2 (\\\"Tribal \\nmembership completes the circle for the member's physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects of \\nhuman life.\\\"). These political  advantages can include \\naccess to medical and dental  services, per capita funds \\n(which Tribes often keep in trust for a child until they \\nturn eighteen), tribal housing, and scholarships for ed-\\nucation, to name just a few.\\n16 When Indian children \\n \\n 16 Like the political advantages of being a state citizen, such \\nas eligibility for in-state college tuition and varying health care benefits, or the advantages of United States citizenship, such as certain protections while traveling abroad including access to U.S. embassies and bargained-for release if ever detained by a \\nforeign government, tribal govern ments also provide political ad-\\nvantages to tribal members. See generally  Brief of Indian Tribes \\nand Tribal and Indian Organizations as Amici Curiae in Support \\n \\n17 \\n remain connected to their Tribes they are afforded the \\nopportunity to embrace their long-standing cultural \\ninheritance by participating in important tribal mile-\\nstones such as a first laugh ceremony, puberty rites, and tribal naming and healing ceremonies. For in-\\nstance, maintaining a connection with her Navajo \\ncustoms and traditions gives M.E. the opportunity to learn how to care for her hair and tie a traditional \\ntsiiy\\u00e9\\u00e9l  (hair bun), have a kinaald\\u00e1  (a female coming \\nof age ceremony), and learn  the importance of weaving \\nand other arts to the Navajo. Although M.E. was not \\nable to have her own, a connection to her Navajo cul-\\nture and community would also give M.E. the oppor-tunity to ensure her own children celebrate an aw\\u00e9\\u00e9' \\nch'ideeldloh  (first laugh ceremony). The ICWA pro-\\nvides a connection between an Indian child and her Tribe, so that even if a non-Indian family adopts her, \\nshe has a much easier road  on which to build connec-\\ntions to heritage, genealogy, medical history, and cus-toms. Indian children should be given the opportunity \\nto know and embrace their tribal political identities. \\n Further, unlike state citizenship requirements, \\ntribal citizenship status can be established, and the ad-\\nvantages of membership can be received, regardless of \\nwhere an Indian child is located. Tribal political mem-\\nbership is not entirely based on \\\"outmoded geograph-\\nical concepts of presence or domicile,\\\" In re  Appeal in \\nPima County Juvenile Action No.  S-903 , 130 Ariz. 202, \\n204, 635 P.2d 187, 189 (App. 1981), in part because \\n \\nof Deb Haaland et al., \\u00a7 II(A)(1), Haaland et al. v. Brackeen et al., \\nNo. 21-376 (discussing the importance of tribal membership). \\n18 \\n Tribes have the right to determine their own member-\\nship eligibility, see United States v. Wheeler , 435 U.S. \\n313, 322 n.18 (1978) (\\\"[U]nless limited by treaty or \\nstatute, a Tribe has the power to determine Tribe membership.\\\"). The ICWA protects individuals' rights \\nto tribal membership and provides Indian children \\nwho are at least eligible fo r enrollment with an oppor-\\ntunity to know who they ar e, where they come from, \\nand to participate in their tribal communities at any \\ntime. See 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1903(4).\\n17 \\n \\nII. THE ICWA DOES NOT PREVENT NON- \\nINDIANS FROM ADOPTING OR FOSTERING \\nINDIAN CHILDREN. \\n Non-Indians regularly fo ster or adopt Indian chil-\\ndren. Aubrey and Sam are direct evidence of this. The Individual Plaintiffs further affirm this fact: Chad and \\nJennifer Brackeen adopted a Navajo child and enrolled \\nmember, A.L.M., over three years ago in January of 2018. See Petitioner State of Texas Appendix to the \\nPetition for Writ of Certiorar i, Brackeen v. Haaland at \\n48a. On December 19, 2018, Nick and Heather Libretti \\nadopted Baby O., a child who is a member of the  \\nYsleta del Sur Pueblo. Id. at 49a. The only Individual \\n \\n 17 In other areas, the ICWA expressly incorporates a Tribe's \\nexercise of inherent sovereignty over its Indian children by recog-\\nnizing a Tribe's placement preferences. See 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1915(c) \\n(providing that an Indian child's Tribe may establish a different order of placement preference); Id. \\u00a7 1911(d) (giving full faith and \\ncredit to Indian legal resources related to Indian child custody \\nproceedings). \\n19 \\n Plaintiffs who did not adopt an Indian child are foster \\nparents Jason and Danielle Clifford. Id. at 50a. In-\\nstead, that child was moved to the home of her mater-\\nnal grandmother. Amicus Curiae  Robyn Bradshaw, \\nSection D, Statement of the Case and \\\"Bradshaw Ap-\\npendix,\\\" at 58a, 60a. \\n These examples are not anomalies because these \\nplacements are a product of the ICWA's structure, \\nwhich explicitly allows fo r placement of Indian chil-\\ndren with non-Indian families  in many circumstances \\nand in other situations, the ICWA does not exclude \\nnon-Indian placement. Furthermore, the ICWA place-ment preferences are not unique because nearly all \\nstates have laws similar to the ICWA's preference for \\nextended family. Lastly, the good cause exception facil-itates the protection of Indian children's best interests \\nin specific cases. \\n \\nA. The ICWA does not exclude non-Indians \\nfrom placement. \\n The ICWA placement preferences value an Indian \\nchild's relationships\\u2014which may lead to placement \\npreference with a non-Indian family or home. For ex-\\nample, the first placement preferences for foster care, pre-adoptive and adoptive placement preferences un-\\nder the ICWA are for \\\"extended family.\\\" 25 U.S.C. \\n\\u00a7 1915(a)(1) & (b)(i). Extended family includes non-Indians and under the ICWA, courts have placed In-\\ndian children with a non-Indian relative over an In-\\ndian foster home. See, e.g., In re D.L. , 2013 OK CIV APP \\n20 \\n 30, \\u00b6 9, 298 P.3d 1203, 1206 (upholding placement with \\nnon-Indian extended family member over placement \\nwith tribal foster home and ex plaining \\\"[a]lthough it is \\ntrue that a purpose of ICWA is preservation of the In-dian Tribe, the language of the Act demonstrates that \\nthe placement preference is for the child's extended \\nfamily over other members of the child's Tribe, with no requirement that the extended family be members of \\nthe child's Tribe.\\\"); In re Guardianship of Q.G.M. , 1991 \\nOK 29, \\u00b6 7, 808 P.2d 684, 691 (Simms, J., dissenting) (\\\"The [ICWA] does not give Indian relatives priority \\nover non-Indian relatives with regard to placement of \\ncustody of Indian children.\\\"). \\n The other ICWA placement preferences do not ex-\\npressly exclude non-Indians and often include them. Courts should follow this descending order of prefer-\\nence: (1) extended family; (2) a foster home, licensed, \\napproved or specified by the Indian child's Tribe; (3) an Indian foster home licensed or approved by an author-\\nized non-Indian licensing authority; or (4) an institu-\\ntion for children approved by an Indian Tribe or operated by an Indian organization. Notably, prefer-\\nences 1, 2, and 4 do not require that the placement be \\nIndian. For example, a foster home \\\"approved\\\" by the Tribe could be a non-Indian home that the Tribe pre-\\nfers, and an institution \\\"approved\\\" by the Tribe could \\nbe a county group home. Therefore, many ICWA ap-\\npropriate placements incl ude placements with non-\\nIndians. Even this Court has recognized that the \\nplacement preferences do not prohibit adoption by non-Indians. See Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl , 570 U.S. \\n21 \\n 637, 642 (2013) (Alito, J.) (\\\"clarify[ing] that \\u00a7 1915(a), \\nwhich provides placement preferences for the adop-\\ntion of Indian children, does not bar a non-Indian \\nfamily like Adoptive Couple from adopting an Indian child. . . .\\\"). \\n \\nB. Nearly All States Have Laws Similar \\nto the ICWA's Preferen ce for Extended \\nFamily. \\n Today, nearly all States have statutes that give \\nplacement preference in child  custody proceedings to \\nrelatives, including Texas.\\n18 In Texas, the state child \\nwelfare agency will place a ch ild with a relative or a \\ndesignated caregiver, including a child's preferred \\nplacement from his or her community.19 If a relative or \\ndesignated caregiver is not appropriate or available, the state agency will consider a previous foster place-\\nment.\\n20 In determining whether a placement is con-\\nsistent with the best interest of a child, Texas prefers \\\"[p]lacement with a relative or other person with \\nwhom the child has a long-standing and significant re-\\nlationship . . . over placem ent with a non-related care-\\ngiver.\\\" 40 Tex. Admin. Co de \\u00a7 700.1309(2). Further, in \\nTexas, the law generally presumes that it is in any \\n \\n 18 See The Indian Child Welfare Act: The Gold Standard of \\nChild Welfare Practice Brief , PARTNERS  FOR OUR CHILDREN  (Feb. \\n2019), https://partnersforourchildren .org/sites/default /files/ICWA%20 \\nBRIEF%20final.pdf. \\n 19 Tex.

Code \\u00a7 262.114(c). \\n22 \\n child's best interest to be placed with a family member \\nfirst, and then with individuals with a significant rela-\\ntionship to the child, before  considering any other out-\\nof-home placement. \\n Other states have similar preferences, including \\nformer parties to this litigation: Louisiana and Indi-ana. See, e.g., LSA-Ch.C. Art. 622; Ind. Code \\u00a7\\u00a7 31-34-\\n4-2 & 31-9-2-107 (defining \\\"relative\\\"); Ariz. R. P. Juv. \\nCt. 320; Ariz. Rev. Stat. \\u00a7 8-514 (the State \\\"shall place \\na child in the least restrictive type of placement avail-\\nable, consistent with the best interests of the child\\\" in \\nthe following order: \\\"1. With a parent. 2. With a grand-parent. 3. In kinship care with another member of the \\nchild's extended family, including a person who has a \\nsignificant relationship with the child . . . 4. In licensed family foster care. . . .\\\"). \\n This general placement preference hierarchy is \\nsubstantially similar to the ICWA's placement prefer-\\nences, which prefers placement first with a family \\nmember. Indeed, the ICWA and state child welfare \\nlaws both seek to preserve  and promote family integ-\\nrity and relative placement in the best interest of chil-\\ndren\\u2013\\u2013Indian and non-Indian alike. By preserving and promoting continued connection to family, culture, and \\ncommunity, the ICWA's protections lessen the trauma \\nintrinsic to child custody proceedings and of any nec-\\nessary removal.\\n21 \\n \\n 21 See Holyfield , 490 U.S. at 50  (stating that the ICWA aims \\nto reduce the \\\"damaging social and psychological impact\\\" Indian  \\n23 \\n  In addition, moving a foster child from a foster \\nhome to a relative for permanent placement is not un-\\nusual in a child welfare case , nor is it unique to the \\nICWA context. In fact, Federal Foster Care Programs under Title VI-E of the Social Security Act must con-\\nsider giving preference to relative placements,\\n22 and as \\nof 2018, 48 states, the Distri ct of Columbia, Guam, and \\nPuerto Rico have relative specific language in their \\nstatutes. The ICWA placement preference for extended \\nfamily is therefore very much like other federal and state laws. \\n \\nC. The Good Cause Exception Facilitates \\nthe Protection of Indian Children's Best Interests in Specific Cases. \\n Even in the limited instances where an Indian \\nhome is preferred over a non-Indian home, exceptions \\nhave been written into the ICWA that effectively bal-\\nance the child's best interests.

See also  Placement of Children \\nwith Relatives , C\\nHILD  WELFARE  INFORMATION  GATEWAY  1 (Jan. \\n2018), https://www.childwelfare.gov /pubPDFs/placement.pdf (\\\"When \\na child is removed from the home and placed in out-of-home care, relatives are the preferred resource because this placement type maintains the child's connections with his or her family.\\\"). \\n24 \\n state court can deviate fr om the ICWA placement pref-\\nerences for \\\"good cause.\\\" 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1915(a), (b). Good \\ncause could be the preference of a parent, as was the \\ncase with Aubrey and Sam where Tina chose to place \\nM.E. with them; the preferenc e of a child if old enough; \\nthe extraordinary emotional or physical needs of the \\nchild or any number of factors held to be good cause by the courts. See id.; see also  25 C.F.R. \\u00a7 23.132(c)(1)-(5). \\nCf. Guidelines for Implementing the Indian Child Wel-\\nfare Act \\u00a7 H.4, B\\nUREAU  OF INDIAN  AFFAIRS  (Dec. 2016), \\nhttps://www.bia.gov/sites/defa ult/files/dup/assets/bia/ \\nois/pdf/idc2-056831.pdf ( BIA Guidelines) (\\\"The rule's \\nlist of [good cause factor s] is not exhaustive.\\\"). \\n As noted in the legislative history of the ICWA, the \\ngood cause exception was \\\"designed to provide state courts flexibility in determining the disposition of a \\nplacement proceeding involving an Indian child.\\\" S. \\nRep. No. 95-587, at 17 (1977). These good cause factors give courts plenty of tools to fashion appropriate place-\\nments for Indian children and do not dictate the out-\\ncome of where an Indian child  will be placed. Indeed, \\nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs recognizes that the good \\ncause exceptions give state \\\"courts and agencies\\\" \\\"ulti-\\nmate authority\\\" and \\\"discretion . . . to consider any unique needs of a particular Indian child in making a \\ngood cause determination.\\\" BIA Guidelines \\u00a7 H.4. \\n And the good cause exception works. In the case of \\nAubrey and Sam, Tina's preference\\u2014based on no di-\\nrect contact with Aubrey and Sam\\u2014was sufficient good cause to have M.E. adopte d by a non-Indian couple. \\nEach year, state courts analyze this important issue \\n25 \\n and affirm placements with non-relative, non-Indian \\nfamilies under the good cause exception. In the last \\ntwo years alone, courts in Arizona, Minnesota, Ne-\\nbraska, and Utah have addressed placing Indian chil-dren and have, where appropriate, affirmed placement \\nwith non-relative, non-Indian families.

Aubrey and Sam decided to adopt because they wanted to grow their family, share their love with \\na child who needed a home, and  give their first child a \\nsibling while Aubrey was recovering from complica-tions attributable to birth injuries. Their adoption at-\\ntorney referred them to an agency in Arizona, which \\nconnected them with a bi rthmother named \\\"Tina.\\\"\\n2 \\nAubrey and Sam were overjoyed that Tina chose them \\nbut were confused about pressure from the adoption \\nattorneys involved to keep the adoption closed to any \\ncontact with M.E.'s Tribes. Aubrey and Sam strongly \\nbelieve in the importance of open adoptions because \\nopenness confers many long-term benefits on all par-ties\\u2014adoptive parents, birth parents, and children, \\nIndian and non-Indian alike. \\n Aubrey and Sam support the Indian Child Wel-\\nfare Act (the ICWA), including the placement prefer-\\nences, because it promotes open adoptions for Indian \\n \\n 1 All parties have consented to the filing of this brief. No \\ncounsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part, and no counsel or party made a monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation or submission of this brief. No person other than Amicus Curiae , its members, or its coun sel made a monetary con-\\ntribution to its preparation or submission. \\n \\n2 To protect the birth mother's privacy, Amicus Curiae  refer \\nto her by a pseudonym. In addition, although some birth mothers prefer other language, such as \\\"first mother,\\\" Amicus Curiae  use \\n\\\"birth mother\\\" or \\\"birth pare nt\\\" because those terms are com-\\nmonly used in adoption literature. \\n2 \\n children, and they believe keeping M.E. connected to \\nher time-honored tribal customs and traditions is in \\nher best interests. Had a member of M.E.'s family been \\navailable to adopt her, Aubrey and Sam would have supported such a placement because they believe it is \\nimportant to keep families together when possible and \\nbelieve that familial placement would have kept M.E. directly connected with her tribal community. It is be-\\ncause Aubrey and Sam love their daughter so fiercely \\nand believe that M.E. has a right to know her Tribes, her culture, and her extended family, that they submit \\nthis brief in support of the ICWA. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nINTRODUCTION AND \\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \\n The benefits of adoption are well established. \\nAdoption allows birth parents to give their children a \\nfamily when they are unable to provide one; adoptive \\nparents can start or grow a family and raise happy, \\nhealthy children; and adoption gives children the gift \\nof a loving, supportive home. The ICWA's procedural and substantive requirements increase the benefits of \\nadoptions by creating a platform for openness in adop-\\ntions and a conduit to Tribal identity. \\n Openness in adoptions reflects the understanding \\nthat communication between birth parents, adoptive parents, and children confers distinct and important \\nadvantages to all parties. Op enness in adoption bene-\\nfits all parties by giving access to vital information \\n3 \\n such as medical and genetic hi story. It also allows chil-\\ndren to maintain important connections to culture and \\nextended family. Open adoptions are particularly im-\\nportant for Indian children because openness allows Indian children to maintain political ties to their In-\\ndian Tribes and receive the ad vantages that come with \\ntribal membership. Without the ICWA's substantive and procedural bulwarks it is too easy for Indian chil-\\ndren to lose essential connection to their Tribal iden-\\ntity. \\n In addition to cultivating a landscape of openness, \\nthe ICWA allows, and sometimes gives greater prefer-ence to, non-Indians seeking to adopt or foster Indian \\nchildren, as demonstrated by Aubrey and Sam's and \\nthe Individual Plaintiffs' stories of successful adoption. And these stories are not unique. Indian children are \\nadopted or fostered by non-Indian families every year. \\nEven if the ICWA prohibited adoption or fostering by non-Indians, which it does  not, there simply are not \\nenough Indian homes for Indian children. Non-Indian \\nfamilies are therefore needed to give Indian children loving homes. \\n Moreover, the first preference under the ICWA for \\nadoption or foster care is placement with extended \\nfamily, a category that includes both Indians and non-\\nIndians because the ICWA does not differentiate be-tween the two when it discusses family. The ICWA's \\npreference for placement with extended family is con-\\nsistent with numerous state laws that give preference to extended family placements. Additionally, when \\nmultiple placement options are available, the \\\"good \\n4 \\n cause\\\" exception to the ICWA's placement preferences \\nallows courts to balance the best interests of the Indian \\nchild against other factors that may warrant place-\\nment outside of the preferences. \\n--------------------------------- \\u2666 ---------------------------------  \\n \\nARGUMENT \\nI. OPENNESS IN AD OPTION AND CONNEC-\\nTION TO FAMILIES AND TRIBES IS IN \\nTHE BEST INTEREST  OF CHILDREN. \\n The ICWA serves as a crucial tool for openness in \\nadoptions because it informs Indian children of their identity and heritage. Without the ICWA's conduit \\nconnecting Indian children to their Tribes, many adop-\\ntions, such as the one Aubrey and Sam experienced, are shrouded in secrecy, a pro cess which only serves to \\nhurt children, birth parents, and adoptive parents. The \\nICWA gives Tribes the tools necessary to participate in placement proceedings to ensure that Indian children \\nremain connected and aware of their customs and tra-\\nditions. See, e.g., 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1912(a) (providing notice \\nrequirements so that Tribes are informed when Indian \\nchildren are in involuntary placement proceedings).\\n3 \\n \\n 3 The requirement of notice under 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1912(a) does \\nnot apply to voluntary adoption proceedings such as Aubrey \\nand Sam's. However, providing notice to Tribes in voluntary pro-ceedings fosters openness and se veral states have enacted no-\\ntice requirements that also apply to voluntary proceedings. \\nSee, e.g., Iowa Code Ann. \\u00a7 232B.5(8) (2022) (providing notice to \\nTribes in voluntary proceedings); Minn. Stat. Ann. \\u00a7 260.761(3) (2021) (providing notice to Tribes in voluntary adoptive and pre-adoptive proceedings); 10 Okla. Stat. Ann. \\u00a7 10-40.4 (2022) (providing \\n \\n5 \\n The ICWA therefore fosters a culture of openness in \\nadoption that leads to many positive outcomes from \\nopen adoptions and a connection to one's familial and \\ncultural identity. \\n \\nA. Openness in Adoption. \\n For much of the 20th century, adoptions were se-\\ncretive affairs where parents did not tell their children that they were adopted or who their birth parents \\nwere. See Deborah H. Siegel & Susan Livingston \\nSmith, Openness in Adoption from Secrecy and Stigma \\nto Knowledge and Connections , Evan B. Donaldson \\nAdoption Institute at 5 (M ar. 2012). Closed adoptions\\u2014\\nwhere there is little to no contact between children and \\ntheir birth parents\\u2014reflect societal attitudes from the \\nearly and mid-20th century, when parents and state \\nlegislatures sought to protect adopted children from the stigma of illegitimacy, misplaced fear that birth \\nparents would eventually \\\"take back\\\" the child, and \\nthe mistaken belief that adopted children could simply\\u2014and without question\\u2014assume their adoptive \\nparents' family history and culture. Secrecy and confi-\\ndentiality, despite the adoptive parents' best intentions and efforts, often led to adopted adolescents having un-\\nresolved identity questions concerning their family \\nhistory and the reason for their adoption. \\n \\nnotice to Tribes in voluntary proceedings); N.M. Stat. Ann. \\n\\u00a7 32A-28-2 (defining child custody proceeding to include adoptive placement) and \\u00a7 32A-28-5 (requiri ng notice for all child custody \\nproceedings). \\n6 \\n  Societal attitudes shifted slowly towards some \\nform of open adoptions\\u2014in which children are aware \\nwho their birth parents are and have varying degrees \\nof contact with them\\u2014or some form of mediated adop-tion\\u2014in which the adoption agency facilitates some \\nform of regular contact between birth parents and \\ntheir children.\\n4 In 1997, for instance, only 16% of re-\\nspondents to a national survey by the Evan B. Don-\\naldson Adoption Institute approved of birth mothers \\nsending cards or letters to adoptive families, with the majority of respondents saying it was only acceptable \\nin some or very few cases.\\n5 The last few decades, how-\\never, have seen a paradigmat ic shift\\u2014so much so that, \\nas of 2012, closed adoptions represented only about 5% \\nof placements, whereas 55% of placements were fully \\ndisclosed, and 40% were mediated.6 \\n The shift toward openness is an important devel-\\nopment that reflects the now-widespread understand-ing that secrecy in adoptions has a negative impact on \\nadopted children, birth parents, and adoptive parents. \\nOpen adoptions come with many benefits including measurably increased satisfaction and peace of mind \\n \\n 4 Amicus Curiae  recognize that open adoptions may not be \\npossible in some cases, such as international adoption, or may not \\nbe advisable in some cases, such as if severe abuse was involved. \\n 5 See Deborah H.

This type of \\ninformation facilitates identity formation, as well as \\npositive feelings toward their birth parents and others. Further, open adoptions help children cope with the \\nuncertainty and the ambiguous sense of loss that come \\nfrom \\\"losing\\\" birth parents, because openness gives children a link to their b iological families and commu-\\nnity.\\n11 In addition, children in open adoptions reported \\nhigher self-esteem, their parents rated them lower in behavioral problems, and th eir families reported more \\ntrust for their parents, fewe r feelings of alienation and \\nbetter overall family functioning.\\n12 \\n \\nB.

If they were \\\"interested\\\" in the child, the \\nadoption agency instructed them to indicate their in-\\nterest, at which point the agency would \\\"share\\\" their \\nprofile with the birth mother. For each of these profiles, \\nthe adoption agency estimate d the cost of the adoption, \\nwhich typically was $30,000 for the Arizona attorney (which included birth parent  living expenses), $2,500 \\nfor a counselor hired by the adoption agency (who, in \\nAubrey and Sam's case, also served as the notary on the adoption paperwork), and $14,000 for the New \\nHampshire attorney. The cost to adopt would therefore \\nrange from $40,000 to $50,000, and adoption was not guaranteed. The costs for ea ch adoption were mostly \\nthe same, but with added complication and cost for \\nadopting an Indian child. Sam and Aubrey were later informed that this was due to the need to comply with \\nthe ICWA, but aside from hiring another attorney at \\nan extra cost and a longer stay in Arizona in order  to \\\"deal with ICWA,\\\" no other details were readily \\n10 \\n provided about what was required to comply. This was \\nsomewhat perplexing to Sam and Aubrey because the \\nadoption agency also strongly discouraged any commu-\\nnication with an Indian child's Tribe. \\n A birth mother named Tina living in Phoenix, Ar-\\nizona, ultimately selected Aubrey and Sam as adoptive parents. Tina reported that her great grandmother \\nwas Cherokee. The alleged father of the baby girl was \\na Navajo tribal member but was not involved in the adoption or in a relationship with Tina, and he never \\nestablished paternity. Neither the Cherokee nor the \\nNavajo Nations were involved in the adoption, and Tina's adoption attorney from Arizona Adoption Help \\nadvised Aubrey and Sam that, due to the Indian ances-\\ntry involved, \\\"the safest course would be for your cli-ents to retain [another attorney] to represent birth \\nparents in taking ICWA consents.\\\" The lawyers in the \\ncase also strongly discouraged any contact with Tina during the process. Aubrey and Sam were thrilled that \\nTina chose them but were co nfused about the secrecy \\nsurrounding M.E.'s tribal status. \\n Tina gave birth to a baby girl on September 11, \\n2020, in Phoenix, Arizona. Almost immediately, the baby girl was placed with Sam and Aubrey, and they \\nnamed her M.E. Twelve days later, the mother's attor-\\nney filed a consent to voluntary termination of paren-tal rights on behalf of Tina in the Coconino County \\nSuperior Court in Flagstaff, Arizona, a court over 150 \\nmiles from Tina's residence. In Arizona, an adoption petition should be filed in the court of the county where \\n11 \\n the prospective adoptive parent resides,13 and no party \\nto the case resided in Coconino County. Aubrey and \\nSam were later informed by mother's attorney that Co-\\nconino County was a better forum for ICWA cases. Au-brey and Sam believe the forum was chosen to prevent \\nany tribal involvement. \\n Fourteen days after M.E. was born, the Judge in \\nCoconino County issued an Order terminating the pa-\\nrental rights of Tina. The Judge held that although the ICWA applied to M.E., there was \\\"good cause\\\" to devi-\\nate from the placement preferences based on the Tina's \\nrequest to deviate from the preferences,\\n14 and placed \\nthe child with Aubrey and Sam. Again, although they \\nwere happy that the Court pl aced M.E. with them, they \\nhad concerns that Tina was not fully informed about ICWA or her options. This concern arose because the \\nattorneys involved only pe rmitted limited contact with \\nTina, especially before M.E.'s birth. The attorneys told Aubrey and Sam they should not ask Tina about M.E.'s \\nheritage and the attorneys themselves ignored Sam \\nand Aubrey's request that they obtain and share de-tails about M.E.'s Cherokee heritage. Aubrey and Sam \\nwere also prevented from discussing other adoption de-\\ntails with Tina, including her preferences about con-tacting M.E.'s Tribes. Although Aubrey and Sam now \\n \\n 13 See Ariz. Rev. Stat. \\u00a7 8-104 (providing that venue for adop-\\ntion proceedings is appropriate \\\"in the county where the prospec-tive adoptive parent resides or, if applicable, in the county where the child is a ward\\\"). \\n \\n14 Good cause may be based on the preference of the parent. \\nSee 25 C.F.R. \\u00a7 23.132(c)(1). \\n12 \\n exchange messages with Tina regarding M.E., Aubrey \\nand Sam still do not underst and why the adoption was \\nshrouded in secrecy when Aubrey, Sam and Tina's \\ngoals were M.E.'s best interests, which necessarily in-cludes open communication about M.E.'s tribal mem-\\nbership and heritage. \\n The attorneys involved in M.E.'s adoption also \\nasked Aubrey and Sam to submit written verification \\nthat they would not enroll M.E. or have any contact \\nwith the Navajo or Cherokee Nations for at least five \\nyears. Although they felt pressured to sign the docu-\\nment, they declined. Aubrey and Sam want their daughter, M.E., to know where she comes from, and \\nthey believe that it is in her best interest to have a con-\\nnection to her Tribes, because of the importance of fam-ily history, access to ho nored Tribal customs and \\ntraditions, and political membership. See, e.g., Samuel-\\nson v. Little River Band of Ottawa Indians-Enrollment Comm'n , 06-113-AP, 2007 WL 6900788, at 2 (Little \\nRiver Ct. App. 2007) (\\\"Tribal membership for Indian \\npeople . . . is the essence of one's identity, belonging to \\ncommunity, connection to one's heritage and an affir-\\nmation of their human being place in this life and \\nworld.\\\"). Had things been different\\u2014for instance if M.E.'s family, such as an aunt, uncle or grandparent, \\nor other extended family, were available to adopt \\nM.E.\\u2014Aubrey and Sam would have supported appli-cation of the placement preferences and not sought to \\ndeviate under a good cause exception. They support \\nkeeping children with their families when possible, es-pecially if that means that a child retains a close \\n13 \\n connection with their family, Tribe, and community. In \\naddition, during the adoption Aubrey and Sam were \\naware that the ICWA did not require them to keep \\nM.E.'s adoption a secret or refrain from contacting the Navajo or the Cherokee Nations. To the contrary, Au-\\nbrey and Sam believe the ICWA encourages connection \\nbetween Indian children and their Tribes and deter-mines that these relationship s are in their best inter-\\nests. \\n Aubrey and Sam believe that the private adoption \\nindustry, or at least some of  its participants, purposely \\nobfuscate the ICWA's requirements and unnecessarily push adoptive parents towards closed adoptions, re-\\ngardless of an adoptive parents' wishes, in order to \\nkeep Indian children like M.E. separated from their Tribes. In the end, these se cretive practices only serve \\nto hurt children and prospecti ve adoptive families and \\nimpede the ICWA's procedural requirements that fa-cilitate openness in adoption. Aubrey and Sam's prior-\\nity is M.E.'s well-being, and they understand that the \\nICWA serves M.E.'s best interests by establishing a connection with her tribal community and by ensuring \\nthat M.E. is placed in a loving and caring home. \\n For instance, Aubrey and Sam only learned about \\naw\\u00e9\\u00e9' ch'ideeldloh  (first laugh ceremony)\\u2013\\u2013a tradi-\\ntional Navajo celebration that marks a baby's progres-sion toward a healthy life and  is customarily organized \\nby the person who made a ne w baby laugh for the first \\ntime\\u2013\\u2013nearly a year after it would have been appropri-ate to hold this gathering. This is just one early missed \\nopportunity to connect M.E. and the rest of her family \\n14 \\n to her heritage, and an example of why many children \\nin closed adoptions struggle to form strong identities. \\nDespite missing this important Navajo tradition, Au-\\nbrey and Sam have taken steps to open the adoption. For instance, they remain in touch with Tina, and pro-\\nvide her with updates about M.E. Tina has expressed \\nher hopes for M.E. and h elped connect Aubrey and \\nSam to the putative father. Sam and Aubrey also wrote \\nto one of M.E.'s Tribes and  asked for information on \\nhow they might establish a relationship with an indi-vidual willing to serve as a cultural mentor for their \\nfamily. The information Sam and Aubrey have learned \\nhas been helpful in planning to support M.E.'s expo-sure to her culture and traditions as she grows older \\nand might begin to question her identity. \\n \\nC. Openness in Adopti on Benefits Indian \\nChildren. \\n The story of Sam, Aubrey and M.E. illustrates the \\nimportance of openness in adoption, particularly for \\nIndian children. It is crucial for adopted children to \\nhave access to their birth re latives, and thus to their \\nbirth family and cultural histories. Equipped with \\nthis knowledge, children can begin to understand  \\nthe reasons leading to their  adoption and to answer \\nfundamental questions such as \\\"Who am I?\\\"; \\\"Where \\ndo I come from?\\\"; \\\"Why do I look the way I do?\\\"; \\n\\\"What is family?\\\"; and \\\"Do I have other brothers or \\nsisters?\\\" Open adoption also gives these children ac-\\ncess to important medical, genealogical, and cultural \\ninformation. Without this knowledge, many adoptive \\n15 \\n children struggle with ongoing uncertainty and have \\nno way to answer these fundamental identity ques-\\ntions. \\n These potential harms are particularly significant \\nfor Indian children. There is an extensive history of \\nactive erasure of Indian identity through boarding schools and other policies aimed at disrupting Indian \\nfamilies.\\n15 See 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1902 (a cknowledging the \\nimportance of the \\\"unique values of Indian culture\\\"). The ICWA's stated goal is therefore \\\"to protect the best \\ninterests of Indian children,\\\" in part by keeping Indian \\nchildren connected to their Tribes. Id. \\n Moreover, historical policies of separating children \\nfrom parents have resulted in increased detrimental impacts on Indian children and families. See Missis-\\nsippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield , 490 U.S. \\n30, 49\\u201350 (1989) (\\\"Congress' concern over the place-\\nment of Indian children in non-Indian homes was \\nbased in part on evidence of the detrimental impact on \\nthe children themselves of such placements outside their culture.\\\"). Child development scholars have long \\nrecognized that adolescent crime, drug abuse, alcohol-\\nism, and suicide are more pervasive for an Indian child \\n \\n 15 See generally  Brief of Amici Curiae  Historian Organiza-\\ntions in Support of Respondent \\u00a7 II, Haaland et al. v.

Topper, Drinking Patterns, Culture Change, \\nSociability, and Navajo Adolescents , 1 A\\nDDICTIVE  DIS-\\nEASES : AN INT'L J. 97 (1974)). Allowing openness in \\nadoption mitigates these impacts by keeping Indian \\nchildren connected to their communities. \\n The ICWA also serves to keep Indian children cul-\\nturally and politically connected to their Tribes and offers many advantages that come with tribal citizen-\\nship. E.g., Samuelson , 2007 WL 6900788, at 2 (\\\"Tribal \\nmembership completes the circle for the member's physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects of \\nhuman life.\\\"). These political  advantages can include \\naccess to medical and dental  services, per capita funds \\n(which Tribes often keep in trust for a child until they \\nturn eighteen), tribal housing, and scholarships for ed-\\nucation, to name just a few.\\n16 When Indian children \\n \\n 16 Like the political advantages of being a state citizen, such \\nas eligibility for in-state college tuition and varying health care benefits, or the advantages of United States citizenship, such as certain protections while traveling abroad including access to U.S. embassies and bargained-for release if ever detained by a \\nforeign government, tribal govern ments also provide political ad-\\nvantages to tribal members. See generally  Brief of Indian Tribes \\nand Tribal and Indian Organizations as Amici Curiae in Support \\n \\n17 \\n remain connected to their Tribes they are afforded the \\nopportunity to embrace their long-standing cultural \\ninheritance by participating in important tribal mile-\\nstones such as a first laugh ceremony, puberty rites, and tribal naming and healing ceremonies. For in-\\nstance, maintaining a connection with her Navajo \\ncustoms and traditions gives M.E. the opportunity to learn how to care for her hair and tie a traditional \\ntsiiy\\u00e9\\u00e9l  (hair bun), have a kinaald\\u00e1  (a female coming \\nof age ceremony), and learn  the importance of weaving \\nand other arts to the Navajo. Although M.E. was not \\nable to have her own, a connection to her Navajo cul-\\nture and community would also give M.E. the oppor-tunity to ensure her own children celebrate an aw\\u00e9\\u00e9' \\nch'ideeldloh  (first laugh ceremony). The ICWA pro-\\nvides a connection between an Indian child and her Tribe, so that even if a non-Indian family adopts her, \\nshe has a much easier road  on which to build connec-\\ntions to heritage, genealogy, medical history, and cus-toms. Indian children should be given the opportunity \\nto know and embrace their tribal political identities. \\n Further, unlike state citizenship requirements, \\ntribal citizenship status can be established, and the ad-\\nvantages of membership can be received, regardless of \\nwhere an Indian child is located. Tribal political mem-\\nbership is not entirely based on \\\"outmoded geograph-\\nical concepts of presence or domicile,\\\" In re  Appeal in \\nPima County Juvenile Action No.  S-903 , 130 Ariz. 202, \\n204, 635 P.2d 187, 189 (App. 1981), in part because \\n \\nof Deb Haaland et al., \\u00a7 II(A)(1), Haaland et al. v. Brackeen et al., \\nNo. 21-376 (discussing the importance of tribal membership). \\n18 \\n Tribes have the right to determine their own member-\\nship eligibility, see United States v. Wheeler , 435 U.S. \\n313, 322 n.18 (1978) (\\\"[U]nless limited by treaty or \\nstatute, a Tribe has the power to determine Tribe membership.\\\"). The ICWA protects individuals' rights \\nto tribal membership and provides Indian children \\nwho are at least eligible fo r enrollment with an oppor-\\ntunity to know who they ar e, where they come from, \\nand to participate in their tribal communities at any \\ntime. See 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1903(4).\\n17 \\n \\nII. THE ICWA DOES NOT PREVENT NON- \\nINDIANS FROM ADOPTING OR FOSTERING \\nINDIAN CHILDREN. \\n Non-Indians regularly fo ster or adopt Indian chil-\\ndren. Aubrey and Sam are direct evidence of this. The Individual Plaintiffs further affirm this fact: Chad and \\nJennifer Brackeen adopted a Navajo child and enrolled \\nmember, A.L.M., over three years ago in January of 2018. See Petitioner State of Texas Appendix to the \\nPetition for Writ of Certiorar i, Brackeen v. Haaland at \\n48a. On December 19, 2018, Nick and Heather Libretti \\nadopted Baby O., a child who is a member of the  \\nYsleta del Sur Pueblo. Id. at 49a. The only Individual \\n \\n 17 In other areas, the ICWA expressly incorporates a Tribe's \\nexercise of inherent sovereignty over its Indian children by recog-\\nnizing a Tribe's placement preferences. See 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1915(c) \\n(providing that an Indian child's Tribe may establish a different order of placement preference); Id. \\u00a7 1911(d) (giving full faith and \\ncredit to Indian legal resources related to Indian child custody \\nproceedings). \\n19 \\n Plaintiffs who did not adopt an Indian child are foster \\nparents Jason and Danielle Clifford. Id. at 50a. In-\\nstead, that child was moved to the home of her mater-\\nnal grandmother. Amicus Curiae  Robyn Bradshaw, \\nSection D, Statement of the Case and \\\"Bradshaw Ap-\\npendix,\\\" at 58a, 60a. \\n These examples are not anomalies because these \\nplacements are a product of the ICWA's structure, \\nwhich explicitly allows fo r placement of Indian chil-\\ndren with non-Indian families  in many circumstances \\nand in other situations, the ICWA does not exclude \\nnon-Indian placement. Furthermore, the ICWA place-ment preferences are not unique because nearly all \\nstates have laws similar to the ICWA's preference for \\nextended family. Lastly, the good cause exception facil-itates the protection of Indian children's best interests \\nin specific cases. \\n \\nA. The ICWA does not exclude non-Indians \\nfrom placement. \\n The ICWA placement preferences value an Indian \\nchild's relationships\\u2014which may lead to placement \\npreference with a non-Indian family or home. For ex-\\nample, the first placement preferences for foster care, pre-adoptive and adoptive placement preferences un-\\nder the ICWA are for \\\"extended family.\\\" 25 U.S.C. \\n\\u00a7 1915(a)(1) & (b)(i). Extended family includes non-Indians and under the ICWA, courts have placed In-\\ndian children with a non-Indian relative over an In-\\ndian foster home. See, e.g., In re D.L. , 2013 OK CIV APP \\n20 \\n 30, \\u00b6 9, 298 P.3d 1203, 1206 (upholding placement with \\nnon-Indian extended family member over placement \\nwith tribal foster home and ex plaining \\\"[a]lthough it is \\ntrue that a purpose of ICWA is preservation of the In-dian Tribe, the language of the Act demonstrates that \\nthe placement preference is for the child's extended \\nfamily over other members of the child's Tribe, with no requirement that the extended family be members of \\nthe child's Tribe.\\\"); In re Guardianship of Q.G.M. , 1991 \\nOK 29, \\u00b6 7, 808 P.2d 684, 691 (Simms, J., dissenting) (\\\"The [ICWA] does not give Indian relatives priority \\nover non-Indian relatives with regard to placement of \\ncustody of Indian children.\\\"). \\n The other ICWA placement preferences do not ex-\\npressly exclude non-Indians and often include them. Courts should follow this descending order of prefer-\\nence: (1) extended family; (2) a foster home, licensed, \\napproved or specified by the Indian child's Tribe; (3) an Indian foster home licensed or approved by an author-\\nized non-Indian licensing authority; or (4) an institu-\\ntion for children approved by an Indian Tribe or operated by an Indian organization. Notably, prefer-\\nences 1, 2, and 4 do not require that the placement be \\nIndian. For example, a foster home \\\"approved\\\" by the Tribe could be a non-Indian home that the Tribe pre-\\nfers, and an institution \\\"approved\\\" by the Tribe could \\nbe a county group home. Therefore, many ICWA ap-\\npropriate placements incl ude placements with non-\\nIndians. Even this Court has recognized that the \\nplacement preferences do not prohibit adoption by non-Indians. See Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl , 570 U.S. \\n21 \\n 637, 642 (2013) (Alito, J.) (\\\"clarify[ing] that \\u00a7 1915(a), \\nwhich provides placement preferences for the adop-\\ntion of Indian children, does not bar a non-Indian \\nfamily like Adoptive Couple from adopting an Indian child. . . .\\\"). \\n \\nB. Nearly All States Have Laws Similar \\nto the ICWA's Preferen ce for Extended \\nFamily. \\n Today, nearly all States have statutes that give \\nplacement preference in child  custody proceedings to \\nrelatives, including Texas.\\n18 In Texas, the state child \\nwelfare agency will place a ch ild with a relative or a \\ndesignated caregiver, including a child's preferred \\nplacement from his or her community.19 If a relative or \\ndesignated caregiver is not appropriate or available, the state agency will consider a previous foster place-\\nment.\\n20 In determining whether a placement is con-\\nsistent with the best interest of a child, Texas prefers \\\"[p]lacement with a relative or other person with \\nwhom the child has a long-standing and significant re-\\nlationship . . . over placem ent with a non-related care-\\ngiver.\\\" 40 Tex. Admin. Co de \\u00a7 700.1309(2). Further, in \\nTexas, the law generally presumes that it is in any \\n \\n 18 See The Indian Child Welfare Act: The Gold Standard of \\nChild Welfare Practice Brief , PARTNERS  FOR OUR CHILDREN  (Feb. \\n2019), https://partnersforourchildren .org/sites/default /files/ICWA%20 \\nBRIEF%20final.pdf. \\n 19 Tex. Fam. Code \\u00a7\\u00a7 262.114(c), 262.752; see Tex. Fam. Code \\n\\u00a7 264.751 (defining \\\"relative\\\" and \\\"designated caregiver\\\"). \\n 20 Tex. Fam. Code \\u00a7 262.114(c). \\n22 \\n child's best interest to be placed with a family member \\nfirst, and then with individuals with a significant rela-\\ntionship to the child, before  considering any other out-\\nof-home placement. \\n Other states have similar preferences, including \\nformer parties to this litigation: Louisiana and Indi-ana. See, e.g., LSA-Ch.C. Art. 622; Ind. Code \\u00a7\\u00a7 31-34-\\n4-2 & 31-9-2-107 (defining \\\"relative\\\"); Ariz. R. P. Juv. \\nCt. 320; Ariz. Rev. Stat. \\u00a7 8-514 (the State \\\"shall place \\na child in the least restrictive type of placement avail-\\nable, consistent with the best interests of the child\\\" in \\nthe following order: \\\"1. With a parent. 2. With a grand-parent. 3. In kinship care with another member of the \\nchild's extended family, including a person who has a \\nsignificant relationship with the child . . . 4. In licensed family foster care. . . .\\\"). \\n This general placement preference hierarchy is \\nsubstantially similar to the ICWA's placement prefer-\\nences, which prefers placement first with a family \\nmember. Indeed, the ICWA and state child welfare \\nlaws both seek to preserve  and promote family integ-\\nrity and relative placement in the best interest of chil-\\ndren\\u2013\\u2013Indian and non-Indian alike. By preserving and promoting continued connection to family, culture, and \\ncommunity, the ICWA's protections lessen the trauma \\nintrinsic to child custody proceedings and of any nec-\\nessary removal.\\n21 \\n \\n 21 See Holyfield , 490 U.S. at 50  (stating that the ICWA aims \\nto reduce the \\\"damaging social and psychological impact\\\" Indian  \\n23 \\n  In addition, moving a foster child from a foster \\nhome to a relative for permanent placement is not un-\\nusual in a child welfare case , nor is it unique to the \\nICWA context. In fact, Federal Foster Care Programs under Title VI-E of the Social Security Act must con-\\nsider giving preference to relative placements,\\n22 and as \\nof 2018, 48 states, the Distri ct of Columbia, Guam, and \\nPuerto Rico have relative specific language in their \\nstatutes. The ICWA placement preference for extended \\nfamily is therefore very much like other federal and state laws. \\n \\nC. The Good Cause Exception Facilitates \\nthe Protection of Indian Children's Best Interests in Specific Cases. \\n Even in the limited instances where an Indian \\nhome is preferred over a non-Indian home, exceptions \\nhave been written into the ICWA that effectively bal-\\nance the child's best interests. Under the ICWA, for adoption, foster care, and pre-adoptive placements, a \\n \\nchildren suffer from removal from their families and culture) \\n(quoting S. Rep. No. 95-597 (1977)). \\n 22 See 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 671(a)(19) (requiring states to \\\"consider \\ngiving preference to an adult relative over a nonrelated caregiver when determining a placement for a child, provided that the rel-\\native caregiver meets all relevant state child protection stand-ards\\\" to receive federal funds). See also  Placement of Children \\nwith Relatives , C\\nHILD  WELFARE  INFORMATION  GATEWAY  1 (Jan. \\n2018), https://www.childwelfare.gov /pubPDFs/placement.pdf (\\\"When \\na child is removed from the home and placed in out-of-home care, relatives are the preferred resource because this placement type maintains the child's connections with his or her family.\\\"). \\n24 \\n state court can deviate fr om the ICWA placement pref-\\nerences for \\\"good cause.\\\" 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1915(a), (b). Good \\ncause could be the preference of a parent, as was the \\ncase with Aubrey and Sam where Tina chose to place \\nM.E. with them; the preferenc e of a child if old enough; \\nthe extraordinary emotional or physical needs of the \\nchild or any number of factors held to be good cause by the courts. See id.; see also  25 C.F.R. \\u00a7 23.132(c)(1)-(5). \\nCf. Guidelines for Implementing the Indian Child Wel-\\nfare Act \\u00a7 H.4, B\\nUREAU  OF INDIAN  AFFAIRS  (Dec. 2016), \\nhttps://www.bia.gov/sites/defa ult/files/dup/assets/bia/ \\nois/pdf/idc2-056831.pdf ( BIA Guidelines) (\\\"The rule's \\nlist of [good cause factor s] is not exhaustive.\\\"). \\n As noted in the legislative history of the ICWA, the \\ngood cause exception was \\\"designed to provide state courts flexibility in determining the disposition of a \\nplacement proceeding involving an Indian child.\\\" S. \\nRep. No. 95-587, at 17 (1977). These good cause factors give courts plenty of tools to fashion appropriate place-\\nments for Indian children and do not dictate the out-\\ncome of where an Indian child  will be placed. Indeed, \\nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs recognizes that the good \\ncause exceptions give state \\\"courts and agencies\\\" \\\"ulti-\\nmate authority\\\" and \\\"discretion . . . to consider any unique needs of a particular Indian child in making a \\ngood cause determination.\\\" BIA Guidelines \\u00a7 H.4. \\n And the good cause exception works. In the case of \\nAubrey and Sam, Tina's preference\\u2014based on no di-\\nrect contact with Aubrey and Sam\\u2014was sufficient good cause to have M.E. adopte d by a non-Indian couple. \\nEach year, state courts analyze this important issue \\n25 \\n and affirm placements with non-relative, non-Indian \\nfamilies under the good cause exception. In the last \\ntwo years alone, courts in Arizona, Minnesota, Ne-\\nbraska, and Utah have addressed placing Indian chil-dren and have, where appropriate, affirmed placement \\nwith non-relative, non-Indian families.
